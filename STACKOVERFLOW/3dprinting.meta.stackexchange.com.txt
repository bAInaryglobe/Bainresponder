I have been wanting to learn about 3D printing a long time so I really want this site to succeed but I have no previous experience with the subject. 

I was wondering how can I help the site at this early stage. I thought about asking about how to get started with 3D printing but SE explicitly discourages "easy" questions in the private beta.

What can newbies like me do for the site at this stage besides voting questions and answers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What can "newbies" do to help the site at this stage?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am in the same position.  I know very little, I am very interested, I want to contribute.  My questions, as well, would be very rudimentary.  Unsure of how I should contribute and 'add value'.


















There are many different printing technologies. While it might be clear to the asker that he's talking about his home 3D printing machine, that's not necessarily the case for those that try to answer the question.

I think it would help to specify the scope of questions with tags, to allow future visitors to identify what type of 3D printer it is about. Answers to a lot of questions related to general properties of the printing process like printing speed, resolution, additional manual work, support structures, etc. depend heavily on the technology that's being used.

This also prevents "Well, it depends..." type of answers that cover a lot of possibly unrelated things.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the specification of printer technology be mandatory?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If printer tags would be mandatory, I also think slicer tags should be as wellb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EricJohnson true, I guess I over-thought this, questions should generally be tagged accordingly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EricJohnson Differences between slicers are minor, and many questions can be answered without that knowledge (it's fairly easy to identify overextrusion/wobble/etc... without knowing about the slicer). Knowing the technology and type of material makes much greater difference.


















No, there will be many questions which are more general in nature, and have little to do with the actual process used to produce the part.

We should encourage tag use for process when appropriate, but I don't think making it mandatory will work in the long term.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, I implied that it should only be mandatory for those questions it is applicable to, not mandatory to all questions.


















Stack exchange isn't a good platform for product recommendations in general, but a few sites allow it with a tight focus and control.  Some that have allowed it in the past have decided to discontinue it for a variety of reasons.

I expect at the start we are going to get a lot of "What specific machine should I use" or "is there a 3D model of item X I can print".


Should we allow product or part recommendations?
If we do, what can we do to make sure they are limited, rather than open ended questions where dozens or hundreds of answers would be different but correct?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we handle recommendations?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Consider: 3D printing technology is evolving *fast*. Faster than technology in many fields. New designs and products are coming out all the time. Any recommendation made today is going to be wrong or worthless sometime between a week from now and 6 months from now.


















From http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/The 7 Essential Meta Questions of Every Beta:

What should our documentation contain?
Much of the sites documentation will be the same as on every other Stack Exchange site: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq#questionsthe Definition phase of Area 51.
But the questions you want to discuss in meta are those issues specific to your site that need to be mentioned in the Help Center.
Take the https://superuser.com/faqSuper User "About" page as an example:

Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.
Ask about...

Specific issues with computer software, hardware or networking
Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered

Don't ask about...

Anything not directly related to computer software or computer hardware
Questions that are primarily opinion-based
Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer
Videogames, consoles, or other electronic devices, unless they connect to your computer
Websites or web services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress
Shopping, buying or product recommendations
Issues specific to corporate IT support and networks


These are then elaborated on in SU's https://superuser.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here? page.
It took almost a year to figure out the list of “we want these sort of questions” and “we don’t want these sort of questions” on Super User. Area 51 gave you a head start but you should also be working out other FAQ-related issues specific to your topic and your community.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our documentation contain?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please forget about the “7 essential meta questions” blog post, it's obsolete but unfortunately still advertised. Instead, read **[The Real Essential Questions of Every Beta](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/223674/the-real-essential-questions-of-every-beta)**. For example, a big “list all we should put in the help” question at this stage is pointless: now is the time to discuss specific issues, with **one issue per thread**.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that this question should be opened. Little bit of editing required maybe.


















When attempting to access the review cue for close votes,the cue hangs and errors out. 

The error states - An error occurred when loading the review item, please try again.

I am able to open review cues on other sites.

Yes, I think such questions should be on-topic.

I think at this stage of development, 3D printing experts are necessarily going to be asking and answering questions about printer internals nearly as much as using them, and, in fact, and lot of usage questions will rely on this specific internal expertise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree also, but what types of questions 3D printing related would be considered off topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChaseCromwell That seems like a [separate question](http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/21/are-questions-that-tangentially-involve-3d-printing-on-topic).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also agreed, strongly.


















Given our successful private beta, soon after we go public it will be time for us to get our first crop of moderators, as explained in the http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/“Moderator Pro Tempore” blog post:


  About a week into the public beta, we will seek out members who are deeply engaged in the community’s development; members who:
  
  
  Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.
  Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.
  Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.
  Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation.
  
  
  Bonus points for:
  
  
  Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).
  Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.
  Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.
  
  
  Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:
  
  
  Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.
  Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).
  Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.
  
  
  Essentially, they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!


Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:


Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.
Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.
If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.
If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.
The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. 
Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.


If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/3d-printingchat room where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room). Another chatroom called http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assemblyThe Assembly was created specifically for users and moderators to discuss moderation activities, moderators from all over the network are there to answer your questions.

Once again, please don't hesitate to step up and self-nominate!.

If you only think you "might" like the job, wait until you've formed a more concrete opinion, or let someone else more sure do it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed @ArtOfCode, it's also important for people to understand that moderators are essentially *human exception handlers*. It can be a lot of drudge work, and it certainly ain't glamorous, but it can be satisfying knowing that you are helping a valuable resource grow and prosper.


















Mandatory is a probably poor choice of words. Not every question is going to be about the use of specific equipment. 

As with any Q&A site, a user should always include enough background and support information in the body of the question so it can be answered definitively. If the specific material or equipment is relevant, be sure to include that information in the post.

But if that information is missing, readers can use the 'comments' section to ask the author to go back and clarify the original post. Comments are meant to ask for clarification or to include other information that can somehow improve the original post (questions and answers). Keep at it; editing and constantly improving a post is what this is all about. These posts should serve as a model to the industry and serve as a source authority. But please do not use comment to answer questions. Comments are not well-equipped to properly vet any content. Thanks.

It is very easy to ask questions that only tangentially involve 3D printing, such as:


How do I drill a hole in a 3D printed part?
How do I paint 3D printed parts?
How do I sand, smooth, etc...?
How do I take a picture with a 3D printed camera?


My last example is clearly not on topic, and the other examples aren't 


  difficult, specific questions — the kind of questions pros and experts ask each other, not the kind of questions novices ask pros.


However, the point is that it's very easy to involve 3D printing in a question that isn't about 3D printing. Drilling a hole in a 3D printed part is, for the most part, just like drilling one in wood. Such questions may be more suited for a general DIY/makers-type site.

On the other hand, there do exist 3D printing specific issues (for instance, low infill or delamination can be a problem when drilling in a (FDM) 3D printed part).

At what point does a question involving 3D printing become on-topic for our site? Should questions identify a specific issue ("I've tried drilling a hole, now my part has delaminated, what now?")?. Queries for general advice and best practice don't seem to fit the bill of being difficult and specific.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions that tangentially involve 3D printing on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Decide by case. On another site, Open Source, we've seen close reasons where something involves open source, but *is not specifically about open source*, and were closed as off-topic. They would've made excellent, relevant questions.


















This should be fixed.  Let me know if you have any additional issues!

Typically, it's a better idea to wait before you try to get this kind of thing integrated.

Enthusiasm is great in a private beta, but for the early stages, direct that enthusiasm towards the Q&A. That's what'll get this site on its feet and into a successful public beta.

When the site's more stable and running nicely, then if there's a need (or want) for a plugin like this then the discussion about it can be had.

(On a tangent - if such a plugin is going to happen, it may well be down to SE's developers to get it done, which might make getting assistance from the people on this site difficult.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually I'm going to say from experience, start plugging now. Getting site specific features out of stack exchange is difficult, so start the process early on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GiantCowFilms it's even more difficult when the site's so pliable that nobody can tell whether it's a good idea or not, trust me.


















This has inspired some discussion and I may be just splitting hairs, but I've always been confused by this strategy.  The specific example I'm referring to is here: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/29/60https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/29/60

In many cases on SE, I see people post "Answers" that basically say "Don't do what you're doing.  Instead you can get to your goal by doing this."  While it is often helpful, this form of answer is the bane of my existence as a user of SE sites.

There are often cases when I am googling a difficult problem because I cannot do "alternative a" as suggested by the answerer.  Then, I get to an SE question that asked about exactly the situation I am having.  An answer of "Don't do that, do this instead" is upvoted, accepted, and the only answer.  Thus, I am unable to solve my problem using SE.  In other words, the Answer didn't apply to the question, and so SE led me down the wrong path.

Am I doing something wrong here?  Is this an expected/accepted pattern?  Or is this something I should go the route of downvoting?  Or like the poster of the above answer suggests, flagging?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Answers that don't answer the questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for bringing this up on meta, consider leaving a comment in the related question and/or pinging the related users next time.


















A big shout out to all of us for a successful graduation into private beta. 
Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly.

This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49post on meta.hermeneutics.SE; I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our "economy", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular Question Votes make the site look more active.


  I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is absolutely critical to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  
  
  Vote on Questions
  
  Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.
  
  If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/Asking Better Questions might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-askHow to Ask directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.
  
  Finally, I want to reiterate that Voting on questions  is free!  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)
  
  Vote on Answers
  
  Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  
  
  You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!
  
  To show that this is true, they've even created a https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanshipbadge for voting up competing answers (called "Sportsmanship").
  
  If you think an answer is useful, vote it up.  If you think an answer is not useful, vote it down.  Either way, vote!
  
  If you need help on writing answers, the meta post https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-questionHow do I write a good answer to a question? will help you out.
  
  Final thoughts
  
  If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.
  
  To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/Vote Early, Vote Often
  
  Encourage others to vote!
  
  Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:
  
  
    Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts ("If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.
  


Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.

This site may attract questions such as


Is it legal to sell 3D printed objects from a model repository?
Are 3D printed guns legal in my jurisdiction?
If my custom-built printer sets my house on fire, does the insurance cover it?


Are such questions allowed on this site, or should they be redirected to a site dealing more commonly with laws?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions involving legal issues and 3D printing on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a little bit of a pre-mature discussion (and even if the questions were on-topic), the questions are not the best quality. I made a tag wiki excerpt suggestion for the [legal] tag, so someone might want to check that outb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Zizouz212 From the [7 essential questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/): "You should actively watch the earliest questions with an eye for quality and purpose. Ask yourself: "Is this the type of question we want on this site? Is it pushing the boundaries of on- and off-topic questions? Are we opening a can of worms?" Talk about these issues in meta, early and often. They are the key to establishing the boundaries around your site."


















Yes, such questions should be on-topic. There can be partial overlap in sites' scopes, and unique legal issues involving 3D printing can be addressed here. Users of this site are more likely to have specific expertise than users on a site that deals with laws more generally.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think we should allow this kind of questions, but in case we do we should add a disclaimer as it is currently in Law SE and Health SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Adolfo That's un-necessary.


















No, such questions should not be allowed. This site deals only with the practical issues of 3D printing. Questions about legal issues should be redirected to sites dealing specifically with those, since users of this site do not have the expertise to address legal issues. A 3D printing expert does not make a legal expert.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I downvoted this answer (while upvoting your answer showing the other viewpoint) in disagreement, because legal issues can be quite relevant to practical applications. If a given filament is not allowed in your country, for instance, your project may - or may not - be impacted.


















I would go with NO, as that should be dealt by law experts from the https://law.stackexchange.com/Law SE, instead of 3D printing engineers and enthusiasts in this site.

Dealing with such questions in this site, would lead to the following problems, like wrong and unreliable advice.

So, such questions should be migrated to the Law site, IMO.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Migrating to Law doesn't guarantee the advice won't be wrong or unreliable either - any advice you get on the internet is bound to be unreliable. The people on this site understand 3D printing much better than law, and the Law people know law much better than 3D printing. The ideal advice would come from somebody with experience of both. In our case, I think our user base may have a lot of unique knowledge (some of our more experienced users may have consulted lawyers before, for instance when starting their own companies) regarding legal issues and 3D printing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomvanderZanden  But, when it deals with Law, I think it would be better to let the Law people handle it :)

Users here might be good at 3D printing related law, but there are more than just 3D printing based law, like material selection, etc which are not here now, but might pop up later.  So, IMHO those would be best dealt in the Law SE :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We most likely don't have a lot of folks who are well-acquainted with 3D-printing law. However, that doesn't mean that we can't recruit folks, or that we can't attract users from Law. Experts don't always restrict themselves to one site. . . :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomvanderZanden You can't migrate to law. I think questions about regulations concerning these are *highly* relevant. Honestly, just because something is on-topic on another site, doesn't mean it should be off-topic here.


















What would be a good tag to use for doing business/making profit with a 3D printer?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag for taking orders and selling printsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Before we start creating tags, would such questions even be on-topic here? Such questions would either be too opinion based (how do I price my models), or the monetization aspect would be irrelevant.


















Don't worry about this.

Before you worry about what you're Tour Page, Help Center... and stop is going to contain, you first need to figure out what your site is about. Make sure that you explain every close vote, discuss every controversial question, and so on. If you don't know the details of your scope, documentation should be the last of your worries.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But we *do* need to worry about this. The whole point of this question is to try and get people thinking about what needs to be put on these pages.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MarkBooth Save the thinking for later. First you need mods, but before that, you need a well-defined scope. Have you seriously gone through all the twists and turns? I think not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would be nice if we have a less generic 'about' text before we have our own moderators. Our community moderators are very friendly and helpful, so it should only take a flag to request they update it. Over on Robotics, our equivalent [What should our FAQ contain?](http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/a/22/37) answer evolved over a few weeks until we arrived at a consensus, and then we continued to use that post to keep track of suggestions and recommendations.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, let's start that when we've got mods then. They're the ones who can do it.


















Vote!

Private Betas love, love, love votes. Without votes, it's difficult to attain privileges, get rewards, and help push us out to public beta.

Ask Questions!

I know you said this:


  I thought about asking about how to get started with 3D printing but SE explicitly discourages "easy" questions in the private beta.


But here's the catch. "Easy" isn't defined. If you have an "easy" question, but it is specific, high-quality, and to the point, and you can show some effort in it, then, please, go ahead and ask it!

Participate!

You have a voice in our meta discussions as well. You also have the authority to suggest edits, to posts, tag wikis, and tag excerpts. They also get you +2 rep for each that is approved, which can help bring you more afloat. You can also give your opinion in scope, by casting close and reopen votes as well :)

answer questions! While it may seem you are new to 3D printing, you are more experienced than someone BRAND NEW to the field, and you may be able to answer some of the questions that are asked on SE 3D printing. In addition, if you attempt to answer a question by researching through google, reddit, etc, you will become more proficient at understanding 3D printing than if you chose not to participate due to 'lack of knowledge'.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@J.Roibal Good point, but in my case, I think it's more lack of experience. I've never actually seen a 3d printer before, touched any software, or anything, so for me, it's a little difficult (I always have to be confident in my answer before posting it).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for your comment. Have you ever tried online 3D Printing services? To me this is a fantastic option for many people and I have just begun my research on it. My first experience with a (working) 3D printer was just a couple of days ago, although I have been researching the topic for many years.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@J.Roibal Not really. As a high school student, I've never actually had the need. With me, I just like helping to start out betas :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fantastic! I am new to SE so much of this is new to me.


















Technological issues

Stack Exchange works hard for its communities, but there is a limit. If thingiverse changes its API (which it can, and does, do at any time without notice) then anything we build on it has to be modified, and users will be very whiny until it's fixed.

If we choose to integrate model viewing or any sort of API integration with an outside service, we will have to make sure the service provides some sort of legacy guarantee minimal API that won't change, and then we will only be able to use that.  

Political issues

I would be very uncomfortable endorsing a closed source, commercial service on this site.  There are many communities within the world of 3D printing that are very unhappy with makerbot, thingiverse, and their parent company, and encouraging users to use this service may result in pushing away some very valuable experts within the reprap world.

Looking to the future

If we integrate any sort of model library or model viewer, I strongly suggest we choose an open source project the community can heartily endorse.  We may link to outside models, but the core API should be servable by stack exchange without license or much maintenance so 1) we don't have to deal with API changes messing us up, 2) we don't rely on outside services that may change their terms of use or API, 3) we don't have to form complicated contract bound relationships with 3rd parties just to get the guarantees we'd need to convince Stack Exchange to invest in a new feature, and 4) we don't become too politically involved such that we disenfranchise users who may have very strong feelings about this subject.

Wait and see

This is the early beta.  Let's find out what people link to in questions before dedicating resources to improving the links/plug-ins/oneboxes.  It may be that thingiverse objects are linked to frequently, and that it would add value to the site to improve that experience, but it's also just as likely that thingiverse turns out to be infrequently linked and the effort spent now would essentially have been wasted.  Let's wait until we have tens of thousands of questions so we can properly evaluate what the community actually uses and needs.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you elaborate on what you mean about Political issues? I don't feel that having a plug in is necessary "endorsing" or recommending a site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can find numerous articles about the [Thingiverse controversy](https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=thingiverse%20controversy) online. As far as whether including a plugin to a specific commercial entity's resource database is endorsing or not, I simply disagree, but don't see the value into going into it here.  Even if you disagree with the political angle, and feel we should shove thingiverse down people's throats on this site, the other problems would still remain.


















The ultimate goal of any answer should be to solve the problem that the asker is facing. Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't think about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that "I must solve it this way" and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. 

That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.

It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is part of the problem. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.

Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like "It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just happens to be an alternative", but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast. Just be open to the fact that if the alternative does work for other people, it's going to remain acceptable on the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5in the case where I encounter these questions but the answers ignore the restrictions stated, wouldn't re-asking the question be marked duplicate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the restrictions are in place and they are still providing answers that ignore the restrictions, downvote those answers and if no one else has yet, post a comment telling them "Oi, you, there, the asker can't use this because it's totes restricted" or something far less colloquial but the meaning is the same. Likewise, if there aren't any restrictions placed but they just provide a bad alternative, that's also not helpful either but just in a way independent of the nature of being an alternative.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am trying to determine whether you are trying to send a signal...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Zizou I dunno what you mean by signal - my main point is essentially, the nature of an answer as an alternative probably isn't important unless in doing so, it actually fails to address the problem provided. It can fail to address the problem on an individual basis (reader can't use the alternative), on a direct basis (asker can't use the alternative), or just on a tangential basis (it's a bad alternative in the first place), all of which are solid things to criticize the answer for when applicable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh no, I was meaning in your username :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Zizou Oh, that's purely because I'm user #2.


















I think that hardware recommendations are ok, but in a limited and specific scope:
Bad:

Can you recommend a cheap printer with a heated bed that's at least 8"*8"*8".
Which is better? Printer X or printer Y?

Good:

What hotend can I use to print at 300+C?
What are the advantages of borosilicate glass over picture frame glass?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the borosilicate glass question, but I'd lump the hotend question into the bad category primarily due to localization in terms of time.  There may only be a handful right now, but half of them will stop being produced in a few years, and a dozen more will pop up in that time.


















Yes - in some cases.

First, overlap between sites is fine. It doesn't matter if a question is on topic somewhere else; that's no reason to eliminate it from a different site's scope. There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.

I do agree that, so far, the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legallegal questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030a comment


  I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.


Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.

We have the same situation here. Some https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legallegal questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.

That's not to say that all https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legallegal questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legallegal questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet.

If something is relevant, and is objectionably answerable, then let's allow it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Zizouz212 I don't think we should answer questions if there is an objection to answering them.

People need to chat more.


















"print-quality" is a better (more specific) tag than "quality", but I don't think we should have a "printer-quality" tag. While discussions about print quality and how to improve it can be reasonably objective, questions asking about printer quality are likely to be primarily opinion-based and off-topic for this site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Isn't there a more-technical/exacting term to describe the "quality"/precision of the output... something akin to the "resolution" in the 2D printing world?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @RobertCartaino, quality doesn't quite seem to be the right phrase. I don't have a better option though off the top of my headb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this answer, but I don't feel we need a "printer-quality" tag because it would likely lead to lots of "Is this a good printer?" style questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChaseCromwell Isn't that basically what this answer says?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RobertCartaino I think "print-quality" is fine. Resolution can be determined objectively, but problem with print quality like stringing, blobs or gaps in the print can't be measured. "Resolution" could possibly be another tag, but as 99.9% of resolution talk would be marketing talk and lies I'd like to avoid that one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomvanderZanden That is a good point, there isn't an exact metric for overall quality


















Filibusters!

I've heard that from somewhere. It's a play on the word "filament"

Oh, Just as a heads up, I can think of the weirdest names...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This will also give us a national anthem! "If there's something strange / in your 3d print / and it don't look good / Where you gonna go? FILIBUSTERS!" :-D


















We currently have quite a few tags about filament:

https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plastic-filamentplastic-filament
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/thermoplastic-filamentthermoplastic-filament
etc.


I feel like we need to clean these up and make clear what we'll use each tag for.

Thoughts?

I see a form of hierarchy that could be used.

Depending on the question a higher level tag could be used or a more specific one for specific problems (or both tags even).

One issue, though, is that if you put something under (for example) "TPU" , then someone who's searching for a parent category like "flexible" will miss it. Unless stackexchange has (or would implement) some automation for category hierarchies. Also, I'd suggest lengthening names since they'll be seen out of context.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the idea of a hierarchy, but how will that be displayed to users?  AFAIK all tags in SE's are independent of each other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You could do somwthing like ABS-plastic-filament vs pla-plastic-filamentb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5while hirarchy is ok and "flexible Filaments" as well as Conductive or water soluble make sense, the category of "plastic filament" is reduntdant.


















Various proposals covering the 3D printing space went through many iterations including a broader site about "Personal Manufacturing" and another for "Digital Fabrication." This is another variation on that scope.

3D printers are going to become increasingly capable and integrate features we haven't even imagined. So as 3D printers start to cross over into other related areas, as long as the questions are not too far outside the target audience of this site, I would allow them. 

This is one of those times where I'd say it's not the "name" that defines this site, but the intentions of the community that built it. So unless (until) there arises a field of questions incongruous with the audience of this site, I wouldn't be too quick to break out the Oxford English Dictionary to define its scope.

Essentially, I would err towards keeping these questions and let their longer track record decide if they belong. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. I think it's somewhat unfortunate the 3D printing proposal was the first to "make it" and not something more general.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1   I somewhat agree and expanding on @TomvanderZanden 's comment, I wonder if allowing discussion/questions about say a mill head, may deter the creation/support of other sites. I think, at this point, the 3D printing community should contain mostly questions related to the technology of 3D printing. Obviously there will be some grey area, but that's what moderation is for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where I work, [Hyrel](http://hyrel3d.com), our printers can take spindle (milling) heads and even diode and (on some models) CO2 lasers, and they all operate on the same gcode - we even have a TIG welding attachment. We also run our Fadal CNC machines on our printer software and firmware. To us, this is a natural progression for a high-quality 3D positioning system, and I encourage a broader definition.


















I think all additive manufacturing techniques should be in scope. Given their popularity with consumers, most questions will naturally be regarding FDM printers. I don't see why that should rule out other techniques though: SLA machines are becoming increasingly accessible, and I think there's a $5000 SLS machine on the horizon.

I don't see any reason to rule out industrial machines either. With the current user base those questions might go unanswered but there's no reason this site couldn't attract industry experts when it goes public.

I do agree that questions should specify the make/model of 3D printer the question relates to if it's not obvious from the context.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think requiring explicit flagging of technology is going to be the way to go here.


















We have only had activity on 3 questions in the past 2 days.  It is recommended that we get 10 new questions per day.  This is far below these goals.

When 3D Printing moves into public beta, you're going to want to get the word out. And fast! One of the best ways to advertise ourselves across the entire Stack Exchange network is through community ads. 

So what are these "Community Ads?"

Graduated sites allow the community to advertise relevant products or services within the site, using a system where the community chooses what to advertise. You can find these posts on per-site metas. Hint: these posts have the /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag!

Cool! What should the ad be like?

There's a few requirements for these ads. Most notably,


They must be 300px wide by 250px tall, or double for "retina" displays
There's a limit on file size of 150 kB.
The image must be hosted on i.stack.imgur (the Stack Exchange image hosting service).
Ads must be GIF or PNG (no animated GIFs).


What else should I know?

To facilitate easy posting to other sites, make sure that the embedded image is of the following format:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


You can also include a message as a part of your answer with your own thoughts: why you chose some of the elements, and what sites the ads could potentially be posted to. Don't forget to critique each other as well!

Happy Designing!

https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/410/how-to-choose-a-right-3d-printer-filament-typeHow to choose a right 3D printer filament type?

I mean, this is usefull question. Why are you guys voting for close? It's not too broad, I formated it to be direct on topic.

Thanks afterwards.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are you voting to close this question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, I've edited the question. Any chance for reopen? http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/410/difference-between-pla-and-abs


















I believe the question can be considered "too broad" because you basically ask for the pros, cons and similarities of every filament that can be 3D-printed.

You last paragraph is a better question, since you here ask how to find the right filament for your cause. If that is really what you want to ask, you could try putting more emphasis on that specific question.

If what you actually want to know is what filament you should use for one specific application - for instance for a part that need to withstand physical stress - try asking about that instead.

In general, it can often be better to ask a question with a specific scenario - even a constructed case - than asking general questions.

Also, remember to always try getting your title as specific as possible, since that is the first impression users will get when the read your post!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, essentially the author is inviting a long discussion about a broad topic. Even if someone could come up with a summary of the different filament types (nothing necessarily *wrong* with that), it doesn't actually answer a question in any *definitive* way. That's why Stack Exchange is often portrayed as "ask a question about a problem you actually have right now."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, has someone edit suggestion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JosipIvic, I believe this answer points out a few alternatives. The actual "new" question is up to you to find. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well, I don't want that question to be closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JosipIvic, in that case, I suggest you update the question (reformulate it so that it has to be answered very specifically), and then request for it to be reopened!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've edited it. Maybe now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I now agree that it is a much better question. It is still fairly generic, but also possible to answer in a Q&A format. However, this exact same question has in fact already been raised before. It is therefore very well possible that your edit will be marked as a *duplicate* instead! :-) 

http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5/how-is-pla-different-from-abs-materialb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So my question to you then is: could you try to rephrase it to not be a duplicate of the question linked above, perhaps by making the question even more application specific? Or, on the other hand, why do you think the question linked does not answer your edited question? Such things might be worth specifying in your question as well! :-)


















For common problems that get asked a lot, I wouldn't just close these as too broad. A better solution is to create a canonical post like this:

https://superuser.com/a/260078/697How do I troubleshoot when I have no clue where to start?

These attract a lot of users. 

The goal is to create a step-by-step trouble-shooting guide to explain what lights, nozzles, and sneedles to look when you're kwigger isn't going zong.

And don't just answer with a hyperlink to some other discussion group somewhere. Do everything you can to really overkill it. Write a detailed, step-by-step, ultra-clear guide, so when zillions of people with this problem go searching, you stand a good chance of the best possible answer on the web. 

This is one of those opportunities to attract some great new users who will add value for years to come.

It might help to keep tabs on these and update the definitions to help future posts as the site develops. I vaguely remember saving a definition for a "General Troubleshooting", but we can update/add tags for "Filament Troubleshooting", "Electronics Troubleshooting", "Failed Print Troubleshooting", etc. This way, when they try to set a troubleshoot tag, it provides them with these narrowed results.


















I don't think any of these types of questions should be on-topic. They're all heavily opinion-based. I think even the last one ("What 3D printer can do X?") isn't a good question, because possibly very many printers might be able to do it, and then the answers quickly devolve into subjective recommendations.

It would be better to ask something among the lines of "I want to do X with printer Y, is it possible?" - but even that might turn into a subjective discussion quickly.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point - they are opinion-based. It could be useful to have a guide for others - that tells how people should choose their printer (figuring out criteria, and finding various features, basically a *how do I choose a printer*). We could make this Community-Wiki, and make any recommendations dupes of that if they are not objective. Ideally though, I'd want to see some examples before we outright reject (or allow) recommendations.


















In addition to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/84/63Robert Cartaino♦'s suggestion, I think that there is value in this class of question.

Over on Robotics we find that troubleshooting questions can often lead to interesting and often more generalised answers, and can lead to further, more specific questions. These types of questions also tend to be the kind which are difficult to answer through a google search, as not knowing what to search for is a big part of the problem.

Sadly this kind of question is often a new users first question, poorly written and difficult to answer in it's original form, so we tend to close these as Unclear what you are asking and clarify that with the https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/177/37following comment:

In general product recommendation on SE sites is off-topic since they're opinion based and can easily end up with a long discussion.

https://www.mathjax.org/MathJax support allows questions and answers to contain pretty mathematical formulae, easy subscripts & superscripts, fractions, roots and greek letters etc. all using LaTeX syntax.

I have seen at least one answer so far which included an equation, so might have benefited from having MathJax markup enabled.

It is apparently easy for the Stack Exchange team to enable, we just need to decide whether we want it or not.

See my https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/131/37MathJax reference post on Robotics meta for some examples of what MathJax can do.

At this time, I don't think this would provide a significant enhancement to the site.

The 3D printing industry is both blessed and cursed in terms of development. While software and general usability is relatively easy compared to traditional manufacturing technologies, the general lack of digital feedback from the machine makes it difficult for the end user.

With this in mind, I find it difficult at this point in time to include 3D printing-related formulas. Most other math-based questions will most likely be https://electronics.stackexchange.com/Electrical Engineering related or https://stackoverflow.com/Software related which I think is still a grey area here on the 3D printing site.

I have been an active user of several Stack Exchange sites since 2012, but have finally now found a site that I really can contribute to. 

As a robotics engineer by education, I early got interested in the art of 3D printing, and decided to join the community for myself in 2014 when I graduated from university. Over the past two years I have experimented with my trustworthy Kossel Mini printer to the point where I now need to set new challenges to still have something to do. Taking part in the Stack Exchange 3D Printer community has provided me further challenges and learning potential, which I truly appreciate.

I already spend a lot of time on this site, and try to help new users uphold the quality standard found on SE sites, answer questions and finish the review queues whenever possible. Overall, I am very proud of how this site has turned out so far, and would very much like to help it progress further. 

To me, taking on further tasks of moderation seems like a natural step, and I hope you will allow me the opportunity to contribute as a moderator in the future.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand how you feel with being able to contribute! I've visited SO for about 5 years now and didn't feel capable of contributing good content until about a year and half ago.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MarkBooth, you are right, of course. I did not at all mean a "traditional forum" in any sense; I simply didn't put any thought into that particular wording of my post. I am fully aware of the Q&A expert reference format of SE sites, which is why I use them daily, and would like to contribute to uphold the quality of their content. I will update my post accordingly!


















These are shopping questions, plain and simple. They are such obvious https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theorybroken windows that it is important that they are closed as quickly as possible.

On Robotics I have the following https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/177/37canned response for shopping questions, and I would highly recommend adapting it for 3dprinting:

Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that *[shopping questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/)* really aren't a good fit for a stack exchange site.

This renders as:

I then close the question as "Primarily Opinion Based". These questions are almost never edited to adhere to community guidelines, but at least I have done my best to welcome people to the community and minimise the risk that they will leave and never come back.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In some circumstances, do feel that the OP's question **I can not do x with my printer, what printer can do x?** fits within scope? I feel that it's kind of in the grey area, somewhere between a shopping question and a technical specs question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is almost always better to ask "How can I do X? I have tried doing this with my printer, but I had these problems". This may result in "you need to buy a printer which supports Y, which will allow you do do X", nut could also result in "I do X with printer Y, this is how", "You need to do Z in order to convert your printer to do X" or even "You can do X with your printer, try this". All of these could help both the OP and other readers. The less closed a question is, the more scope for good, varied answers and novel solutions.


















I think you highlighted one of the more important points, in that "SE works best with clear and logical questions that lead to clear and logical answers". From what I've noticed (and I just went back through my own voting history), there have been a number of "primarily opinion based" and "too broad" questions. I believe it's important to maintain quality questions/answers especially in this early stage of release. Please regard https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-should-our-documentation-contain?rq=1this other meta post asking what the guidelines are for proper 3D Printing community questions.

I, for one, feel that I learned the most SE etiquette by reading a large number of questions on SO as opposed to the SE documentation. It seems that a few of the questions we've gotten lately have been from completely new users to the Stack Exchange network. I don't like scaring people away from the site, so it is best to try and coach these new users.

I retract the following suggestion as I agree with https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111/closing-locking-too-many-questions/112#114Mark Booth's answer given his explanation.

I would suggest an informal guideline for closing questions:


First, notify the OP to the condition of their question. Perhaps even suggest a means to fix the errant condition(s).
If, after at least 24 hours of the comment, the OP has not either responded reasonably (within SE etiquette) nor updated the question, then begin the process of closing.


I'll leave this open to the community for amendments below:
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is why I love community building on Stack Exchange, people always seem to be ready to revise their opinions in light of other peoples ideas and explanations. It reinforces that this is a place to learn, not a place to argue.


















I have to agree with the both of you; the best kind of question are those that are clear and logical, and thus can be answered as such. 

On a site such as SO, these are the kind of questions that ends up "staying", getting a high view counts and the great answers. There are, however, also a large amount of new questions on SO that never meet those standards, but rather face the same kind of problems that we see here.

I believe the issue for most new users - here and on SO - is that in order to ask a good question, you more or less already need to know the answer, or at least the format of the answer. And with 3D printing being such a novel technology for most users, they simply do not have the required experience to ask the "correct" question at their first attempt.

Perhaps our job should lean more towards helping users to find out what they really should be asking about, rather than simply voting down or closing the question right away because it does not uphold our desired standard. As for how to accomplish that, I think the points mentioned by @tbm0115 could be a good starting point.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for the *And with 3D printing being such a novel technology for most users, they simply do not have the required experience to ask the "correct" question at their first attempt*. It's sometimes difficult to find the balance between maintaining the integrity of the content and helping newbies. We've all been a newbie to the technology, and I remember "not knowing what I don't know".


















The important thing is to make sure that people understand that a closure is not permanent, which is why questions are given the "[on hold]" suffix rather than "[closed]".

On Robotics, one of my https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/177/37Copy-pastable comment text for common problems with questions? is:


  Questions by new users for closed for other reasons
  
  Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that questions like this really aren't a good fit for a stack exchange site. We prefer *[practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)*. Take a look at [ask] and [about] for more information on how stack exchange works. Also, the [*Robotics* question checklist](https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1302/37) has good advice on how to write a good question. If you edit your question to fit our community guidelines we can reopen it for you.


Closure is intended to temporarily stop people answering questions which can't be easily answered in their present form, while the question is being improved. As such, I disagree with https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/112/63tbm0115's suggestion that we should artificially delay closing a question (at this stage in the sites life there aren't enough people closing questions as it is) and suggest that we always close a poor question as soon as possible, but give people the information they need to fix the problem.

Instead, I offer the following suggestion:


If you want to vote to close a question without writing a comment to say why, with suggestions as to how to fix the problem, think about how this looks to a new user and how they might feel about the rejection.


If people assume there is nothing they can do about their question being closed, and this drives them away, then we should do all we can to correct that misunderstanding, encourage them to learn how Stack Exchange works and ask better questions.

Finally, don't forget the importance of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theorybroken windows theory.

The quicker poor questions are closed, the higher the good:bad question ratio is, the more likely new users will see examples of good questions, and the less likely that they will base their own question on a poor example of a question. This is why good questions are the most important thing on a new site. They draw in experts to answer them and they set a good example for how new questions should be framed.

So, close early, close often, and comment with the information needed to get the question re-opened.

I just noticed that there is a large amount of tag wiki excerpts edits in the review queue, all of which are of the form:


  X is for questions about X


A tag wiki excerpt should define what a term means to our community specifically and give usage advice. In particular, Stack Exchange offers the following default reason for rejecting an excerpt:


  Tag excerpts amounting to, "[tag] is for questions about [tag]" are pointless and usually rejected. Excerpts should describe why and when a tag would be used.


See the https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/tag-excerptshelp center for more details on what a tag excerpt should be.

While obviously well-intended, I believe such tag wiki excerpts should not be suggested (and/or approved). This post is to serve as a gentle reminder of that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Circular tag wiki excerptsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I apologize, as I think I submitted a few bad examples. In some cases, it's hard to come up with an excerpt for tags that are considered "common knowledge" such as *hotend* or *g-code*. I, personally, find it easier to provide the details of the types of questions in the details. So, what would you suggest doing for an excerpt for "common sense" tags?


















A synonym has been suggested already for the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hbphbp and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heated-bedheated-bed tag. https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hbphbp was added to a single post, and in order to create a synonym there needs to be at least 5 posts containing the similar tags. Now that the synonym has been suggested, most of those posts with dual tags can be reduced back to just https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heated-bedheated-bed.

Currently, (03/28/2016), we do not have any moderators to make these tasks easier to manage.

If the synonym suggestion is not accepted, then external searches may be hindered to only display results for the term heated-bed as opposed to heated-bed or hbp. So, if you have a chance to properly address a synonym, definitely do so as it will only help bring more users to the site.

I believe StackExchange is currently in the process of selecting intermediate moderators until the community is built enough to conduct elections.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 90 days? That's a long time. I'll see if I can check something up. Either no one wants the job, or well... not of me to speculate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Zizouz212 Ironically, I just emailed someone with Stack this morning to get a status. I volunteered for moderation, and what I was told is what I mentioned in the comment above. However, it probably wouldn't hurt to try and invoke some action.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, 90 days is seriously pushing it. I'll see if I can get an eye on things


















Firstly, the appeal to being a user on a StackExchange site is the general Q&A structure which differentiates itself from common forum-based websites. I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.
Search Engines
Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.
So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.
Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:
Extruder keeps jamming as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.
MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament as a question title is more specific and contains more "keywords" that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.
Etiquette
I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to "advertise" the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend "advertising" the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.
If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.

Hopefully this helps
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think what you bring up about posting links from our site to answer in other communities sounds like a sensible approach. First off, it is not direct advertising; secondly, new users might get their eyes up for the site given we provide good answers; and thirdly, it will also increase the search relevance of the site!


















It seems like a great subject to incorporate, since bioprinting is 1) pretty neat and 2) an important application for 3D printing in general... but I sort of suspect none of our active users have the necessary expertise at the moment. It's a highly specialized field. We don't want the question to sit for an extended period with (at best) 1-2 mediocre answers, do we? That seems to be what happens to this sort of question at the site's current activity level. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While we might not have a large user base for bioprinting right now, the existence of questions like this can draw in those users through searches/advertisements. In the case of this specific question, I think a good magazine article might suffice as I assume the OP is really only looking for basic information anyways. Later, as more experienced users join, the question may be answered further. So, do you think this topic is acceptable despite our low user-count?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's a good topic -- based on previous discussions that this is more than just a "hobbyist FDM" site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RyanCarlyle, I agree. Bio printing is a novel field of research with high recent growth, even through it might not very doable on a hobby basis.


















I think 3D bio printing - just like any kind of 3d printing - certainly should fall within the scope of this site. One could argue that such questions are hard to answer, and most likely outside the knowledge of most users, but I still think good bio questions should be encouraged. 

As for the linked question specifically, I think it is way too broad, asking not one, but perhaps five completely fine questions at the same time. Individually, I believe those questions would be answerable to the right person.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing up the issue with multiple questions. I agree, the resolution for the question at hand would be to break the question into different pages. If there is a reason-code for "too many questions" then that should be chosen when closing or putting questions on hold moving forward?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree! There certainly should be a code for that. I guess that "too broad" covers it fairly well in some cases, but answering a very broad question is hardly doable, while multiple separate questions could be - well - separated!


















I'll try my hand at it and try to get the ball rolling.

The end switches of my 3D spider printer don't work well. I wonder whether it's on-topic asking how to repair 3D printers. In my case I'd describe what does not work, what the result is and what parts are used.

From a good answer I'd expect a proposal on how to fix it, e.g. a suggestion for an electronic piece to buy (like a photo sensor maybe) and how to apply the wiring etc.

Derived from https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8/are-questions-discussing-printer-construction-internals-and-firmware-on-topicPrinter construction, I'd also say that repairing must be on-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Repairing 3D printerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This should really be carrying the [discussion] and [scope] tags :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Zizouz212: added them. Thanks.


















I'd say that repair questions are more on-topic than construction. And if construction questions are okay, then repair questions should be too.
An example format might be:
How do I repair {X}

I've tried {a[]} to fix {X}, but {b[]} occurred. What are some other common means of fixing {X}?

Most of what is acceptable on SE is troubleshooting and I feel that repairing is a subset of troubleshooting. In other words, typically you'll result in repairing from troubleshooting, but [hopefully] not the other way around. So, a repair question is essentially requiring, upfront, what a great quality answer would provide in some troubleshooting questions.
For example:
{X} wont work

{X} isn't working, what could be the cause?

could lead to:

I've encountered {X} as a result of {Y}. I was able to fix it by performing {C}.

Where {C} is typically going above and beyond the OP's question.

Throughout the beta, we need members from the site whose focus is to engage the community, both in community-building issues and site management. That's why we select a few members from each community to act as temporary, provisional Moderators. You can read about the program here: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/Moderators Pro Tempore.

It has... been some time since the site has begun. Normally, pro tem selection process is done very early in the site lifecycle (read: second week). However, in a mix of a mess largely centered around myself, the selection process not only took a while to get off foot, but also took a long time to complete.

All that is done now! I am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community’s issues are properly addressed.

https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/98
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/4762
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/2146

We want to make this site a huge success, and these members are great examples of exactly the type of people we need to make this site succeed. Please welcome them for the hard work and time they contribute.

Most of all, be respectful and understanding of the Moderators Pro Tem. Members of your community are volunteering their time and learning on the job. It’s a learning experience for everyone. 



And thanks to these previous volunteer moderators too:

I absolutely agree. I believe we all want this site to maintain high quality, but right now almost no questions fall within our desired scope and form.

I think we either need to:


Change the acceptable scope of questions to be asked
Change how we welcome new users


Right now most new users do not ask questions "the SE way", which quickly leads to down-votes and closing votes. For new users this is a direct slap in the face.

What we rather should do is to encourage new users to improve their question, and if they do, give them the highly desired up-votes to make them come back for more. 

I think the reputation system on SE sites is a great motivator for writing good questions and answers. And if we want this site to grow, we need to let our fellow users grow with it.

When we time and time again close questions as *off topic* or *too broad*, we at least need a reference - both for ourselves and those who asked the question. As of now I still haven't found such a reference made specifically for this site. Perhaps [this](http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/138/what-is-our-scope) will be a good start?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My goal for the post you linked above is to eventually have the content to update [this](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) page which has been waiting for moderator intervention.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, thank you for the link!

Once it's updated, that is


















We've discussed this issue before https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111/closing-locking-too-many-questionshere in Meta, but I think that part of the issue (and I'm guilty of it) is that regular users expect a certain amount of effort or back story from questions. To me, it seems that most https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed%3Ayesclosed grey-area questions seem to be related to materials. So, questions that may be considered too broad as a general materials question may be a viable question for a newbie to the 3D printing world. A new comer may not be familiar with various material types (ie. PLA[filament], ABS[filament], Stainless Steel[powder], Bronze[powder], etc.).

Focusing on material questions may be a good start to the concern. While it may be technically too broad asking materials questions, in reality, most questions (in FDM/FFF realm) are going to be either about PLA or ABS (maybe Nylon) unless there is a specified purpose for the object. So, if a user specifies (or hints) the preferred printing method (FDM/FFF, SLA, etc.) then I think we should let people use their better judgment in answering the question.

Would it be appropriate to consider re-opening closed questions with the before mentioned criteria?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks like several of those questions could be answered.  One in particular is a user asking about how to determine if a material is food/dishwasher/microwave safe.  One could have answered with what must/must not be present in the material chemically to make it safe and other things to observe like temperature and how porous the surface is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another question - http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/40/alternatives-to-reprap-project could be answered simply by pointing them to one of several pages on the reprap wiki...one of which I started myself which was a table of most of the printers on the wiki with their build size and other miscellaneous information.  I will have to find a link to the page when I get home but that question could have been answered.  Also, one of the comments on it could have been remade into an answer with just a few links to repositories...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've posted a new Meta topic to potentially list viable topics [on this page](http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/138/what-is-our-scope)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tjb1 - Would it be worth re-opening [the question](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/40/alternatives-to-reprap-project), in order for you to post an answer?


















There has been a lot of questions and confusion about what is acceptable here on 3D Printing SE. Let's go ahead and discuss what types of questions should be acceptable on the site.

We're going to do this based on votes. I'll leave it up to debate in the comments below, but we'll emulate Area51 question requirements. Here are the guidelines:


10 positive votes, passes.
One answer per topic. The focus is voting on topics, and votes pertain to the validity of the topic.
Similar topics that can be merged should explicitly mention the deprecated topic.
Appropriately passed topics should have closed questions re-opened (as appropriate).

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is our scope?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As discussed below, I am redirecting this broad scope discussion so that specific concerns can be raised and discussed through individual meta posts as needed.


















Mechatronics
More specifically, question relating to electronics, mechanics and control theory which is set in a 3D printing context.
Why include:
There are multiple questions about 3D printing that also could be asked in the electrical and mechanical engineering sites, as well as the robotics site. However, since most 3D printers basically are desktop robots, all of these topics will eventually be relevant.
Examples: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/623/real-life-stepper-speedone and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/542/what-is-the-benefit-of-using-an-arm-based-electronicstwo.
Why exclude:
In some cases, questions within these topics might simply receive much better answers by people at the other sites, such as https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/975/do-the-tw-thw-and-thhn-or-thwn-wire-insulation-types-matter-in-terms-of-powerinthis seemingly simple question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 I agree, but with extreme emphasis on *set in a 3D printing context*. Can you possibly elaborate on what constitutes as *in a 3D printing context* and visa-versab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115, I very much agree. There are some questions within electronics, mechanics and robotics that should be answered at other sites. I guess figuring out exactly what a "3D printing context" is, is the difficult part. I, for one, cannot give a clear definition of this at the moment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe we could specify that related SE sites are electrical engineering, robotics, stack overflow, etc. As far as examples, perhaps appropriate material usage (ie. ABS, Nylon, Stainless), use of robotics in 3d printing (automation), multi-tool printers (ie combination machines that 3D print, mill, solder, etc.). Just a start?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115, mentioning other sites from the help page sounds like a good idea!


















Context: I have absolutely no knowledge of 3D printing other than you need a computer, a printer, some software, and a design. That is literally the extent of my knowledge on 3D printing.

However, I have an idea of something I'd like to have 3D printed. While the idea has a fairly reasonably defined shape in mind, it doesn't exist in any digital or paper format and has some specifics that still need to be filled out (such as accurate dimensions and a few design details).

I need to bridge the chasm of knowledge between my current design and limited knowledge to a fleshed-out design file with chosen materials and other specifics. A good chunk of my problem is that I don't even know what I should know. While I realize that this site is still fairly new and things are being nailed down, how do I ask the proper question(s) to fill in my knowledge gaps that will be on-topic for the site? Is there even a path forward for these kinds of questions on the site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions from people who lack knowledge of 3D printing looking to discover how to have something printed on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe beginner questions will have the most value to begin to develop a library of high quality Questions & Answers. The more focused and specific the question faced by a beginner, the more high quality the answers will be. For Example, the question "How Do I insert filament into the extruder?" or "why does printing size/speed/resolution matter?" will be applicable to many new users, have a definite answer, and will have the original question-asker more enlightened in the subject of 3-D printing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@J.Roibal: I certainly understand all that. My issue is that I'm not a 3-D printer, as a professional or even a hobbyist, at all. What I want to do is to have an idea that I have printed... probably by someone else. But, I have no idea how to go about it and right now, my idea is only generally defined. So, I need to get from "generally defined idea" to "printed example" somehow.


















I am going to strenuously advise against using this format for resolving what should be considered on topic for this site. 

I can appreciate the desire for decisive action and expediency, but it would seem untenable to tell someone their question is off topic because only the top {x}-voted subjects were deemed on topic, while {x-1} didn't make the cut. You are essentially looking to exclude large areas of interest by polling a relatively modest portion of an upstart, growing community. Polling is not a good substitute for discussion; this is not how you build a functional site. 

You have a good site here. You started with a community that was very welcoming of questions about 3D printing in general. If you later discover that a particular subject poses a problem, then the community can decide if you should forgo those questions entirely. But that comes through thoughtful discussion in an open format — a conversation about why a particular subject poses a problem — not by a popularity contest where only the most-voted subjects get in. 

Users can raise concerns about any topic they have here — that is what meta is for —  but please resist the temptation for excluding content before it demonstrates a wide-spread problem in actual practice. It's a recipe for a very exclusionary site; one where everything is looked at through a lens of suspicion where everything is off-topic until proven otherwise. This is not the way to build a healthy, growing site.

I've gone ahead and attempted to update the On-Topic help page (it was still in its default state).  Is this a more appropriate approach? What else can we do to help minimize these types of concerns? Also, should this question be closed now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Robert, would you say that a better approach would be to handle individual cases through meta-questions, and rather update the On Topic help page as we go?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, individual concerns can be raised if a problem becomes ongoing. But don't feel you should resolve every passing concern with another entry in your help center. Sometimes that odd-ball post doesn't become an ongoing issue at all. Resolving every meta post with another rule will turn your help center into a bulleted list from hell. Meta posts may *start* a conversation, but sometimes broader issues should be allowed to work themselves out organically over time. Don't rush it. You might be interested in [this conversation with Retrocomputing](http://bit.ly/1W9hRDS).


















I think it depends. There are no "best" settings for printing any one material, as the optimal settings will depend on the model being printed. I think questions of the format


  I have X printer, using Y settings, printing Z model in material W and I have V problem - how do I improve my settings?


would be vastly better than


  What is the best profile for printing material X with printer Y?


I suggest we close question of the latter format as "Unclear what you're asking". What settings you should use depends on much more than just the printer and material. An answer to the question of the former format would also be useful to a much wider audience (since it deals with a well-defined problem and fix for that problem), while an answer to the latter format is only useful for people using that specific printer and material.

In particular for the less reliable desktop printers, there are simply no correct settings, as the settings will work differently with a few changes in bed-leveling - for instance. In such cases, the latter probably will not be well answerable at all.


















We have https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1117/alternative-3d-molding-techniques-at-homea recent question that brings up the question of "Should we support general hobbyist questions?"

Currently, there doesn't appear to be a viable site within the SE network. The question at hand seems to be a mix between 3D Printing and DIY. If we allow this question, it could allow people to ask questions like the following:


CNC Mills
Routers
Lasers
etc.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hobbyist Machine questions On-Topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This topic has a positive reception but 19 month later, no actions are taken. Is there a plan to change 3D printing scope?


















I believe all of these machines essentially are 3D printers with a different tool! As far as I know, you will often end up using both the same software and electronics as with 3D printers, and many questions can therefore be directly related as well. There are even several commercial "Multi 3D printers" that can do several of these functions.

Then again, I also think it depends on the specific question asked. :-)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm still not quite convinced that these machines fit within scope. It might be different if the site was named **Hobbyist Machines**. My experience with routers and such is they have their own kinks (like 3D printing) and completely different software. However, I don't think there is currently a site on Stack Exchange that fits, making 3D printing the closest fit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It sounds like you have at least some experience with these machines, which I don't. I can look at each machine and say *these look the same*, but I have no real experience with each one of them. As such, you might be right that these topics should be separated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whomever -1, care to elaborate?


















It is worth noting that the question referenced in the OP deals with a vacuum forming machine, which isn't (similar to) a 3D printer by any stretch of the imagination. It heats up a sheet of plastic so it melts, which is then formed (using a vacuum applied from below) over a model. This just allows you to make copies of an existing model.

If we want to allow these types of questions, we should get the name of this site changed (to something like "Makers SE"/"Rapid Prototyping"). I don't know if that's even an option, but as it stands, "3D printing SE" should be about 3D printing; CNC mills, vacuum formers, etc... are clearly not 3D printers and thus off-topic.

I don't find "there's no other place for this" to be a convincing argument; the scope of a site should not depend on what other sites do or do not exist.

That said, I do feel the just 3D printing scope is a bit limited and we could attract a larger audience by including other types of rapid prototyping/manufacturing. The name would be a huge misnomer if the scope included that, but I guess the only way to get a name change (if that is possible/appropriate at all) is to begin by changing the scope.

As it stands, the question referenced in the post is definitely not on-topic (since the machine involved is very un-printer-like), but questions about CNC machines (and similar machines) might be. They mostly run different softwares (GRBL/Mach3) but you could conceivably run a CNC machine on Marlin.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. I think a slightly generalized site name like "Makers SE" would be more appropriate. Such as StackOverflow allows multiple languages, we should have a site that adheres to rapid prototyping of varying types.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree as well. The specific question mentioned seems off topics, but I still don't think that all CNC questions need to be. Could we perhaps use an approach where we evaluate each question that come in one by one - at least until we know what kind of questions we will encounter?


















As we got tags for other applications like cura | slic3r | meshmixer etc. I vote to add new tag mattercontrol for MatterControl application. There could be also synonym matter-control.

In general we could also consider synonyms for all said applications according to pattern app-applicationname so app-slic3r | app-cura and so on.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag for MatterControl appb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice idea! I have created the tags for you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you @TormodHaugene but don't you think it would be better to have matter-control as a synonym? I'm not very familiar with synonyms subject but i suppose they act like tags but don't polute tag namespace.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do not know if we have any definite tag name conventions, but from what I understand we use a dash when there is a separation between words. For the MatterControl tag, I guess it then depends on whether the CamelCasing should be interpreted as literal space or not. I created a [question](http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/151/naming-convention-for-tags-with-camelcase-or-pre-fix) regarding this, so that we can put it up for discussion.


















Are there any official naming conventions for tag names on Stack Exchange? And if not, how should tags be named?

From what I understand, one typically adds a dash (-) where you normally would leave a space, but how about tags that derive from words that are https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/150/tag-for-mattercontrol-appCamelCased, or somehow https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/postproductionPrefixed?

Examples (which also shows some inconsistencies):

Topic            | Existing tag         | Alternative tag?
----------------------------------------------------------
MatterControl    | matter-control       | mattercontrol
MakerBot         | makerbot             | maker-bot
Post-production  | postproduction       | post-production
Post-processing  | post-processing      | postprocessing
Multi-material   | multi-material       | multimaterial


Which of the above tag alternatives should we go for?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Naming convention for tags with CamelCase or Pre-Fixb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Makerbot and MatterControl are proper nouns. In the case of MatterControl you should use camelcase (since that's how MatterControl does it themselves) and "Makerbot" should just be "Makerbot" (no hyphens or camelcase).


















I would say we could use synonyms to stay with clear tag namespace.In this case we apply following pattern (especially for proper name (product name)):

Topic          | Existing tag    | Synonym?
---------------+-----------------+--------------
MatterControl  | mattercontrol   | matter-control


I think dash could be used to separate kinda branch for example:

app-cura, app-mattercontrol, app-meshmixer << these could be also synonyms
3d-printer, 3d-models, 3d-design


of course we already have tags like

feature-request, switching-power-supply


but they are descriptive and would be unreadable written as one word, one may say these describe actions
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, if someone accidentally creates a new tag for an existing similar tag, we can just create synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 Synonyms aren't really designed for minor variations in tense or formatting; text completion will take care of that. Synonyms were intended to be used where there are two completely *different* words used to describe a concept (think: 'car' > 'auto'). Adding a lot of unnecessary synonyms will only fill your tag listings with a lot of unnecessary entries. I would avoid it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So in other words, we should try to avoid having *both* "matter-control" and "mattercontrol", but rather stick with only one? I guess that makes sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@darthpixel, I'm not sure if I think having tags that prefixes what the topic is about, such as *app-* mattercontrol, is a good idea, since this strategy only would make sense to already existing users familiar with the pattern. In addition, do we really need a prefix to avoid ambiguity in the tag names?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TormodHaugene maybe you are right. I always gravity to organize things, that's why I proposed app-. Of course it's not necessary and of course it will mean something only for existing users. So there was no such proposition ;)


















I admire Tormod idea.

Great work!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really like the idea AND the execution, it is a nice simplified design that appeals a lot to me. However, while it would be a great logo for the site, I don't see it advertising for our site in any way. I would not even identify it connected to 3D printing if I didn't know what it was for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kamuro I got an idea how to increase "the feeling of 3d printing" but I have no time to draw it. It's gonna be the same pictogram but steam/smoge will have shape more like printing head and inner fill wil form 3D letters. Despite that logo doesn't have to be 100% recognizable by it's meaning - compare M for macdonald's but not for butger itself ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, but the big M already is well known and doesn't advertise just with the M. As I said, as a logo it's really great. But it won't create the urge in ppl to click the ad, because they won't even know it is an advertisement instead of just good looking design.

Looking at other SE sites, the most common approach seems to make everything lowercase (including names and trademarks) and using hyphens whenever there would be a space or hyphen in normal usage.

As such:


MatterControl becomes mattercontrol
Makerbot becomes makerbot
Post-production becomes post-production
Post-processing becomes post-processing
Multi-material becomes multi-material

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that this seems like the most sensible way of setting tag names. If no one has any strong opinions against this, I suggest we go through the tags archive and correct what we can, and keep this in mind when reviewing new posts.


















I believe you more or less answered your own question here! In the post, Tom van der Zanden commented: 


  Perhaps you could edit your answer to make it self contained (by giving brief instructions on how to resize in sketchup).


You responded that this would be an very simple answer, and that you would have to explain the OP how to "press the resize icon and resize the model". If I were you, that is exactly what I would have done. In other words, explain how to resize the model and perhaps add a simple illustration.

Remember that best answers are those than can be easily understood. :-)

PS: Linking sources is great, so keep that up! Just remember to summarize the essence of it in the answer itself.

I just didn't want to leave him (or question) with no answer (as he (it) formally stayed now). I imagine that no one had an idea how to explain it in SE manner as the question was such simple that answer would be 10x more complex... so IMO sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@darthpixel, I see your point. I have to admit I try to do the same occasionally, sometimes to limited success. I guess we will have to look for a middle ground: something not link-only and not 10x.


















You raise an interesting issue that swerves into the very purpose of having a Stack Exchange site. 

Here is the actual guidance that went with the removal of that post:


  Thank you for answering, unfortunately links sending users elsewhere to find that information aren't really considered an "answer" in the context of this site. The folks here will work hard to curate this collection of knowledge, so when someone finally finds this site through search, the last thing we want to do is send them elsewhere to find that information. If you don't think the question is worth answering here, you can always vote to close, but I have to remove this as "not an answer" in the context of this site.


The quality of the link you provided is not in question. The problem is that Stack Exchange isn't meant to be a search engine or a list of links. We have Google for that. 

Our role in making the Internet a better place is in curating a high-quality collection of crowd-sourced knowledge. Stack Exchange rates very highly among search engines, so when someone clicks through thinking they finally found an answer from a highly-trusted source, we have a responsibility not to purport having information we do not. 


  sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all


That's a well-meaning consideration, but it ignores the purpose of curating this content as a whole. You may help that one person in the minimal possible sense… but for the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of people who come after, all we did was create yet another barrier between the user and the information they were searching for.

That does not make the Internet better.

Redirecting users elsewhere can also displace folks who may have posted a proper answer. Few people are actually privy to these meta discussions and what makes these Stack Exchange sites "work", so oftentimes users looking on will largely consider the issue resolved. Folks mostly emulate the practices and methods they see, so if cutting and pasting a link serves as an answer, then everyone can do it. 

And in that vein, please do not answer questions in comments. Comments do not have the voting and the wiki-style editing features which allow us to properly vet and improve this content. And comments sit very prominently right there below the question, so they appear before even the best answers which are supposed to rise to the top. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still think it's not quite clear which answer is or isn't just-a-redirect and it will never be clear as some information isn't worth to be rewritten "just because". I see Lars and others answers to this question http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1150/open-source-3d-scanning and to be honest I don't really see much difference to said (my) answer. And let's be clear - I don't want Lars' and others answers to be deleted. I just want to highlight that criteria what is and what isn't an answer are discretionary... please notice the questioner acknowledged the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you haven't replied on comment above, about differences between soem answers, but ok - you are busy mod. But in your answer there is a sentence "(...)we have a responsibility not to purport having information we do not". What about the knowledge we have? http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3047/while-filament-loading-extruded-filament-wiggles/3049#3049


















It's pretty manageable right now due to the low question rate, but I think maybe ~3% of all questions this site will get, forever, will be "what's the best printer" or "what printer should I buy" type questions. They're mostly coming from people who don't know enough about 3DP to articulate their requirements, so they're difficult to help and very unfocused. Is there a better way to handle this than locking them as they come up? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any way to prevent endless "best first printer" posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems the best solution is to create an intro to 3-D printing that answers this question and can be easily discovered or promoted to new users, perhaps somewhere along the right hand side?


















I think the site tries to prevent this as best as possible, short of having a bot prevent the post.


There is the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askDon't Ask page and the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicOn-Topic (which we have control over its content).
The suggested/related questions that appear when asking a question. Ideally users at least regard its existence before posting the question.
There appears to be a pop-up that does try to warn the user that their question is "subjective". I tested it really quick, see the image belowhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/uRJdC.png
All else fails, that's what moderators are for. Moderators should utilize the tools available to them. So even if these types of questions pile up, there are means of quickly identifying. A simple feature, available to everyone, is advanced searches. I try to use searches like https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=title%3A%223d%20printer%22%20is%3Aquestionthis to quickly identify large groups of questions that may need attention.


It might be nice to have more options over whether keywords can be contained or not, "asker" reputation, "answerer" reputation, etc.

As for searches, the [Data Explorer](http://data.stackexchange.com) may come in handy. Your second point kind of raises the classic "chicken and egg" problem. If there isn't much that addresses the user's problem, it doesn't help.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Zizouz212 That link is amazing! There's so many little tools tucked away, it gets hard to keep track of what's available sometimes.


















A good option would be to have several reference questions, such as "What to look for when comparing printers?" or "How to select a 3D printer?" to which we could redirect these users.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It might be a good idea to initially specify the type of machine (FDM, SLS, DLP, etc) in the question to try and avoid "too broad" issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this sounds like a good idea to start with. Since there still are not that many posts on this site altogether, manually posting links to a set of proper answers for "standard questions" will not be too much effort. A good reference question might also make reach far up on search engines, and therefore reduce the need for new users to ask those same questions over again as well.


















Overall, you'll want to try and stay away from "What is the best..." type questions. However, I would say that services related to 3D printing should be okay. Please regard https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67/fdm-printer-that-can-also-mill-and-engrave-whats-in-scope/68#68Robert Cartaino's response on potential topics. He brings up a good point:


  This is one of those times where I'd say it's not the "name" that defines this site, but the intentions of the community that built it.


For the questions in mind, I think that questions related to discovering new "Makerspace"-type communities and sites would be appropriate. In the case of your software question. I would definitely highlight some key features, if you can, of what you might be looking for. For example:


Plug and Play software
Customizable G-Code
Advanced control over parameters
Dual-Extrusion capability
Compatibility with a print server
etc.


Information like this can make or break a "What is the best..." question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about a question like..."What maintenance issues have you seen in 3-D printers in Makerspaces?" or even "What type of maintenance is typically required when operating 3-D printers at high production?" Thanks in advanceb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JRoibal Overall, I'd say go ahead ask the questions. It doesn't hurt to go ahead and ask these types of questions. If they don't quite adhere to what the community is looking for, the community will let you know by temporarily closing the question until we can agree on the best way to present your question.


















As with your https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/164/questions-about-makerspaces-and-3-d-printersother question, I think the same rules apply. Typically you want to stay away from asking questions about "What is the best...". Instead, try to present your question as more of a "What is the best... for me?" type question. As I mentioned in your other question, try to provide more details of what you might need. In the case of 3D printing services, I'll use the example of 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ (I'm not affiliated at all, just an example).

A "What is best..." question may be appropriate if the contents of your question contains key characteristics of what you, as an individual, needs out of the service. For example:


  I need a part printed, but I also need this key feature machined and coated. I've looked at 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ, which (at this point) would be able to perform all of these operations for my part?


On the opposite perspective:


  I want to start providing 3D printing services, but I have a CNC router and some other woodworking machines that I'd like to provide services for as well. Which might be better for me, 3D Hubs or MakeXYZ?


In each example, there is more of an emphasis on what you need as an individual. Another user can take the answers with a grain of salt and best apply the answers to their own situation in the end.

It doesn't hurt to go ahead and ask these types of questions. If they don't quite adhere to what the community is looking for, the community will let you know by temporarily closing the question until we can agree on the best way to present your question.


















I have to disagree with this request because the two are technically different (and I mean technically in literal form).


Support material helps define relevance to a specific material type, ie PLA/ABS, PVA, that lime stuff that MakerBot tried selling, wax, etc.
Support structures helps define relevance to the existence of support structure being generated and/or their physical dimensions.


So, I guess you could say that Support Material is a what question (as-in what is it made of) and Support Structure is a how and why question (as-in how is it made and why is it needed).

I'd also like to point out that you said


  I don't think there is the need to have separate tags for support's structure and material, since the material is in most cases the same as printed.


A large factor in maintaining the quality in a site like SE is adhering to all cases, even if that means having a large number of tags to keep track of.

I didn't think of it in a way that someone would want to clarify that he/she has a problem with support when printing ABS, but not PLA. If these cases are found by users and if we want to keep the diversity for that, I agree to leave them separate tags. Thanks for clarifying this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not a problem, thank you for raising the question :)

I would like to ask how to convert photos of some object to 3D model, and eventually how to treat the object before taking the photos to increase accuracy of the result (see https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1477/how-to-optimally-make-a-3d-model-of-an-object-using-photosHow to optimally make a 3D model of an object using photos?).

To add to it, 3D Printing SE is still in Beta and therefore we are still trying to determine which questions should or shouldn't be asked on the site. So, as Tormod suggests, go ahead and ask your question and we'll close questions based on community responses. Thank you and welcome to 3D Printing SE!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, I'll do it later. I will focus on how to treat the object to improve the scan, while  the software part will be on the side, since it's more for Stackoverflow.


















I'm glad you bring this up: I have to admit I have not been using these filters very much. Reviving old unanswered questions seems like a good idea, and I think both of your replies are good examples. 

In addition, I think we could shed some light onto the other beta goals as well. What do you think about more actively giving good quality questions and answers +1? I believe increasing the overall reputation will encourage users to come back, while also helping us reach our beta goals. 

Furthermore, that community add we have been discussing https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76/community-ads-lets-make-2d-ads-for-ourselvesover here, does anyone know how to actually get that going? :-)

So your example [here](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76/community-ads-lets-make-2d-ads-for-ourselves#answer-126) you need to submit it as an answer (I think)... Actually I'm wrong (those seem very old meta posts) and haven't the faintest idea what one has to do.


















Sparked by another question on meta, I again wanted to reflect on my voting behaviour and the generally accepted practice on 3D Printing SE (3DP:SE) in the current beta stage.

I know this post https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30/vote-early-vote-oftenVote early, Vote often, and I do take it to be still the general guideline on how to vote on 3DP:SE.

I personally do like to vote what I'd call slightly more liberal than conservative and I do have the feeling that this is not the way it is usually handled by other users (as can probably be seen by the fact that only two people on 3DP:SE acquired the civic duty badge).

Also, if I look at the questions from the beginning time of the beta, there were much more votes in general. (This of course might be related to many things as 'more substantial questions and answers', more regular users and time that has passed since the question exists, allowing for more views and hence votes).

If a new question already has 40 views, however, I would expect more than 2 votes on the question. It means that 38 views happened in short time, this is, mainly views by 3DP:SE regulars, not search engine referrals (I strongly asumme this point, I do not have any hard evidence), which did look at the topic but have not been touched by the topic enough to vote up, down, or comment.

In general this probably is pretty regular behavior (seeing my behavior in the reprap forum for example, where I generally only pass to read, not to interact that much). In the phase this SE is in I'd take it as highly beneficial if we could encourage more action in the users (in this thread the most simple one - voting), because missing interaction maybe won't bring users back regularly enough.

Are there any ideas how to get the 'https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30/vote-early-vote-oftenVote early, Vote often' policy across to new users?
(And if applies: do I take a wrong approach - are there enough votes?)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we motivate users to vote and advertise the voting policy?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sorry, I'm a bit confused with the wording of the last few paragraphs, can you please elaborate or edit the question? Kudos on being one of the Civic Duty badge holders btw!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have noticed this tendency as well, and I think not up-voting enough is a bad habit that doesn't benefit anyone. One might think that one cannot upvote a question or answer that isn't perfect, and sometimes you might not have any personal experience on the subject to actually have a strong opinion about it. However, I still think giving new and established users a thumbs up for their effort is crucial for the growth of this site. And eventually, as the site gets larger, the voting system will truly begin to work, as bias from individuals will be averaged out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I enhanced the last paragraphs and hope it is more clear now. @Thormod: I agree, when the site gets larger, the voting system will take off on its own, and the reward for user's efforts and good answers will come more easily. What do we do until then?


















The question was migrated because the specific question of "How do I tell if my Thermistors are 10k or 100k?" is going to be best answered by users of Electrical Engineering SE. This also provides the SE network with more appropriate traffic based on the question at hand.

However, if the question of "How can I change the thermistors settings in Marlin firmware?" were to arise, then the question would be best suited here on 3D Printing. It might help both SE sites by providing links to each other's relevant questions for future users to reference.

If the question was something like "How can I wire a hotend?", this would be more appropriate here on 3D Printing SE as users in Electrical Engineering SE may not know as much about the topic compared to users in 3D Printing. This may be a poor example, but the idea is that there is strict correlation between hotends and 3D printing, whereas identifying thermistors is not a specific topic to just 3D printing.

Update

After reading a few posts on SE meta, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-workthis one leads me to agree with you that this particular question may not have needed to be migrated. However, it exposes an important question of how we want to proceed with questions like this in the future? How far down the rabbit hole do we want to allow this site to go in this topic? I'd recommend others pitch in recommendations in answers here on what would be the appropriate topic in this case that can be applied to our https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicOn-Topic page so that it may be amended.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe that a question should only be migrated if it is **off-topic** for the site where it is being migrated from. I am sure it was *also* suitable for electrical engineering, but that is secondary to the question of whether it is appropriate for this site. I don't think the question was off-topic, as determining what kind of thermistor your printer has is something you might run into while 3D printing. We could have answered the question from a 3D printing perspective, whereas an answer from an electrical engineering perspective might not be what the user was looking for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomvanderZanden I've updated my response above. My perspective was that the question was almost entirely related to EE SE and only remotely related to 3DP SE. However I agree that this is a grey area currently, so its subjective. I'll keep this post in mind in the future and refrain from migrations on this subject until the community deems it on/off topic. I don't think the post shows it anymore, but I did ask the OP if they felt it appropriate to migrate specifically to EE SE. Hence the comment "That's true. Can that be done by someone with more rep?". Thank you for bringing this topic up.

Unfortunately, I don't think that the Stack Exchange network is a good fit for the type of question you're asking. Your question was flagged as primarily opinion-based. Essentially, the question you're asking is a poll or survey which the design of the Stack Exchange sites don't properly support. Here are some more appropriate solutions for what you're asking for:

Following this https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2617/decent-cnc-control-software-for-osxissue I would like to propose to allow general CNC related questions here as well. 3D Printers are CNC machines, they only add instead of subtract. 3D printers use G-Code, just like CNC milling machines.

3D Printing alone makes for a very narrow community if it excludes subtractive manufacturing questions. For example, there is no python.stackexchange.com or javascript.stackexchange.com, all of that goes into one network: stackoverflow.com. That's just the same level of division.

Navel-gazing has never done anyone good :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wondering why CNC questions in general are not welcome hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are now machines that do both additive and subtractive manufacturing (3D printing and CNC), so the line is not as clear as it used to be.


















There are tens of SE sites that deal with programming in some way, shape or form. SO is obviously the most general one of these, but there are many more specialized ones (CodeReview,TeX,Programmers,Drupal/Wordpress/Joomla/Server Fault/Ubuntu/...). If this site had been "Makers StackExchange" or "Digital Fabrication" then your question might have been appropriate (this site being a more general one), but "3D printing" should be seen as a more specialized one (but if you think there is a need for a specific Makers SE or a CNC SE, then you could consider going to Area51).

This site is called "3D printing" and CNC milling is definitely not 3D printing. I think it does very much make sense to limit 3D printing to "additive fabrication". This is not a particularly narrow scope, since there are many types of 3D printer, and not all of them use G-code. Powder printers (binder jetting) and DLP printers are driven with raster images, for instance.

If the scope were extended to cover your question (which is about 2D milling, not even 3D milling, while we're at it) then I wonder if that meant that questions like "How many flutes do I need on my 8mm ball-nose left-hand bit when cutting unobtainium with my feedrate at the speed of sound?" would also be in scope. When I hear "3D printing SE" I would definitely not expect that.

I would add that your question might have been closed on a hypothetical "CNC SE" as well for a variety of reasons:


Opinion based/list question
Very little own effort
Too broad (need to be more specific)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I had proposed the site with the name [3D Printing and Rapid Prototyping](http://area51.stackexchange.com/posts/82438/revisions) with the hopes of having my laser cutter questions answered, alas, we ended up with strictly `3D Printing` :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think making it a "Makers SE" or something would be a good upgrade.


















Thank you for bringing this up.

I think that there very seldom are any good questions that ask for printer or software recommendations, and I would therefore vote for them not being allowed in general. 

So far I have handled these types of questions by waiting to see if other users flag them, and then take action after a close vote has been made. If we decide they should be avoided in general, we probably want to put them on hold right away - this would also make the answers much more consistent after eventual edits.

UPDATE:

Another recommendation https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2708/what-better-3d-printer-for-dental-applicationsquestion was asked today. The OP wants to buy a 3D printer that can be used for printing dental implants. I believe this question has two possible types of answers:


Highly subjective: "Printers made by MkrBot are much better than PtrBot, get the first (...)"
Informational objective: "Get a resin based printer because they typically have better resolution than FDM printers (...)"


While the first is almost entirely opinion based, the second can offer some proper insight that will help the OP in search for a specific printer. In these cases, I suggest that we try to guide the OP into formulating their question such that they promote answers of the the second type, rather than the first.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think your suggestion to rework that recommendation question was all that good. The question lacks initiative and own research. It's incredibly broad (it considers every possible printing technology) and the requirements are extremely vague ("resolution" and  "surface finish"). A somewhat better question would be "I am considering technology W and X what are the pros and cons of each for printing Y models given Z requirements?".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I fully agree that the version you mention would have been better. Though, I don't think we always can expect that kind of specificity from users who does not seem to know what to ask about. Then again, if the edited question still is too broad, we probably simply shouldn't reopen it. That being said, what is your stand on the topic of how to handle recommendation questions in general? Put on hold asap, and close if nothing happens?


















I noticed that the most popular tag (82 questions tagged) is https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3d-printer3d-printer, and that we also have a https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3d-printing3d-printing tag (23 questions). These seem extremely redundant to me, given that they should apply to any question that is on-topic and thus serve no practical purpose. These tags are simply too broad.

The usage guidance for 3d-printer is quite board ("Questions about a specific brand, model, or type of 3D printer.") and 3d-printing does not even have one.

I would suggest to get rid of these tags. For comparison, https://stackoverflow.com/tagsStack Exchange does not have a programming tag either. However, they do have various tags that end in "-programming", such as "functional-programming", "linear-programming", etc... Our equivalents would be fdm(-printing), sla(-printing),...

Just http://stackpromos.com/promos/16/winter-bash-2015like last year, Winter Bash 2016 is being held by the Stack Overflow team between 19 December and 08 January 2017.
If we want to participate, the hats will find our heads too without further action. If we for whatever reason don't want to participate, we can choose to opt out.
What do you guys think? Do we want the hats of 2016 here on 3D Printing SE? :-)

Here is parts of the mail that was sent to the moderator team of 3D Printing SE:

Most of you remember previous years’ events, but here is a quick little reminder. Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg
As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!
The Details
The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.comhttp://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event.
Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage.
The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.

In past few months, there are a devastatingly few number of users that cast up votes, and many of users aren't coming back to site, and existing users don't have so much reputation, because no one is voting up great questions / answers.

So... let me start like this..

https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=allTHIS IS REALLY DEVASTATING

We all need to vote up users and try to answer their questions, so we can get more users answering / asking questions. Main reason I'm writing this post is because this is great site, but we need new regular users that are going to vote and ask questions. I think it all came down to 20-30 active users, and rest of users aren't so active.

I'm relatively new to site. I've decided to use it because it helped me a lot, and I'm doing my best to answer the questions. My main concern is also that my answers also don't get any vote up.

So... I'll let it all out. I think that main concern that we need to focus on is motivation.

WE NEED TO MOTIVATE OTHERS TO VOTE. And we all can do that if we vote other users up.

That's from my perspective. Even one vote up motivates you to go further.

I think that I explained what I mean. :) It's all in VOTE UP!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Remember to vote!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll also point out that we have a very ridiculous amount of questions that no one has selected an answer for.

I'd like to talk about site building a little bit. We have now been in public Beta for almost a year now and I feel that we've learned a lot about what audience we have here on Stack Exchange. However, we've got a little ways to go before we can make it out of Beta.

Ultimately, the kink in the chain is that we do not have enough visitors. The more visitors we accrue, the easier it may become to reach some of these smaller goals such as questions per day and user reputation. Remember that the home page for 3D Printing has sharing links to social media sites.

There are a growing number of 3D printing sites such as Thingiverse, 3D Hubs, MakeXYZ, Shapeways, etc. All of these sites have avid users and I'm sure many of them have questions on a regular basis and are more than happy to share their knowledge with other Makers/Professionals.

Let's increase our Votes!

The more people we have visiting the site, the more opportunity we have have gaining more reputation.

As Josip Ivic states in a recent https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-voteMeta post, asking/answering questions becomes a chore if people don't feel that they're efforts are appreciated or good enough. Often times there is legitimate research going into answering certain questions, so there can be real work going into providing people with quality answers.

The same goes for asking questions. If you've been in the same predicament or appreciate a well written question, give the question an up-vote.

Meta Activity

I think it is also important for everyone to occasionally review the latest here on Meta. It's a great tool for people to express how they feel the site could be better!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53D Printing SE Beta Statusb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With more questions-a-day the rest of the problems should get better. Congratulations on the answer rate, I've seen Beta sites doing way worse on that front.


















I completely agree! I just posted https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/197/3d-printing-se-beta-statusmy own reminder, focusing more on efforts to get us out of Beta.

I'm sorry you can feel discouraged sometimes, I think a lot of users around the Stack Exchange network can feel that way at times.

I think people sometimes forget that an up-vote to an answer isn't necessarily that it was helpful to you, specifically. But, rather that the answer is a good quality answer and will be useful to others as well!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) _awesome_ answers are voted for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Voting seems to have been lacking on this site specifically though. We receive a lot of new Stack Exchange users that don't continually come back. So it's hard to teach people the etiquette of votingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I fully agree with voting on quality rather than just content. I believe the best answers will get more votes anyway, so just bumping all decent answers up one level just keep the site rolling and motivates users. Of course, if the answer isn't good or simply incorrect, there will be no upvote either (but perhaps a comment). :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I fully agree with both question and answer. Voting is very important on SE sites and helps with growing a steady userbase.


















Strangely enough, I was thinking (prior to reading this post) that this particular SE site was quite good w.r.t. the voting, when compared to some other sites. Most of my questions/answers have received votes, whereas on other (nameless) sites, I have posted a number of questions/answers and not received [m]any votes at all. However, this must be my (inaccurate) perception, as the stats shows that the voting is not at the desired levels.

While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied (or, if you will, overly enthusiastic) voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) awesome answers are voted for. This overly enthusiastic voting can sometimes end up giving random votes to questions that are not particularly researched, or answers that are not fully accurate, which maybe do not deserve any votes at all.

I am not sure why this (comparatively) frenzied voting occurs, or why it dies down, nor am I sure what (which?) level of voting is appropriate - although it is obvious that poorly researched questions and inaccurate answers should not be voted up. 

Regardless, I would agree that voting does act as an incentive to contribute to the site, as well as the idea that voting for a good question, or accurate answer, even if that question/answer does not apply directly to you, because it will help other users. Indeed the latter is the entire premise of Stack Exchange.

Hmm yeah we might have a minor problem. I know most of my rep is disportionately from question acceptance and unusually low for +1s. I wonder if it has to do with any active member being able to be on the top 50 list their first month, thus people maybe hoarding their upvotes trying to be number one?  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a certain amount of [reputation bias as a result of being on a SE site earlier](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/288076/is-reputation-really-about-how-hard-you-try-to-help-or-sit-back-and-relax-for-fe). However, there are many blogs/podcasts on how to achieve higher reputation. Most of it stems from answering early and how you format your questions/answers. A little styling goes a long way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5True, I know that how I was answering questions last year was pittiful compared to my current answers. I hope to have more such improvements this year ;-) That said interesting enough on Android stack overflow and others most of my rep is for +1s on answers 3 or 4 answers after the first. Here however yes most of the time if I answer first I get the acceptance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can check the voting stats [here](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=all).

Well we need to attract more members! Personally I know a lot of people that can help us attract more. Myself I run a facebook group with 6k members called 3d printing hobbyists. That said I am also friends with the admins of the other and larger groups. 

If I had some good promo material I could probably get folks like 3d printing nerd to mention the SO group in his highly visible channel. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, the more members we have, the higher our chances of getting some of these items checked off. I never got any traction on the 3D Printing forums, personally. So, if you or other members here can make referrals to SE for technical help, please do so! As far as promo material, take a look at [some of our ads](http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/76/community-ads-lets-make-2d-ads-for-ourselves) or make your own. If you would like some help coming up with material, feel free to ping me in the [chat board](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/the-hotbed-3d-printing)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 got permission to post it in a few groups. So a few thousand hobbyists should see itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That sounds great! Thank you for your participation and help around the site by the way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You don't need more members... You need more *committed* members. Once you have an established base, you just need time to let it growb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Haha okay how do we get more committed members without telling more people about it? This is simple stats. Every few thousand impressions will lead to a few clicks. Out of that hand full a few. Maybe 5 will ask a question. Maybe 1 of those 5 will become a regular.. that's how I see it.


















I see your point in how CAD modelling only is an indirect match for this site; however, since it falls naturally into the workflow of 3D printing, it is indeed something most of our users have experience with. Furthermore, I believe many users get introduced to CAD through 3D printing, which again could make 3D Printing SE a natural place to turn back to.

In my opinion, I think we should allow these types of questions - at least for now. I don't see them as a problem due to their low frequency, and I think we generally manages to produce sensible answers. 

There is also issue that there currently are no other Stack Exchange sites that focus on general CAD. There is always https://blender.stackexchange.com/Blender SE, but it would again be somewhat off topic there as well. Perhaps we could find some relevant beta site to direct pure CAD questions to? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5At some point there is a line.. Maybe it is when we get to platform (I.E. solid works tool, autocad filter) specific question, or maybe that is too far and we want to draw the line before that. I am not sure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that CAD questions are mostly on-topic. However, only if generally related to 3D printing, or possibly with intent to 3D print the model.


















So, I'm the first who got https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/44/electorateElectorate badge. Go guys and fetch that badge. You can only get that badge by voting. This is a very young SE site, and there's need for users that vote, because voting is encouraging others to post and to discuss.

Cheers once again and remember to vote up!

That's very sad.

Using this guy to post on the facebook groups. As an admin of 3d printing hobbyists I usually see posts get 2-3k views. So We might get as high as 5k+ views. But it seems to be fairly random with Facebooks meddling with what content to show first.

On the other hand - there was no formal voting for any logo here so I don't know if other members share the vision...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hard to say if there was an impact. I'll try again when it is not christmas. Though I did get a ton of reputation from new questions those 2 weeks..


















I'm a bit confused as to why there is a badge targeting a specific tag https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3d-printing3d-printing. I don't know what came first the tag or the badge, but it poses a potential flaw on either side.

We agreed to merge 3d-printer and 3d-printing tags in https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/189/why-do-the-3d-printer-and-3d-printing-tags-existanother meta post. I don't see it pull up in the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badgesbadge list.

So, should we merge tags in the other direction now, change the badge, or not worry about it?

I just created https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3394/how-to-straighten-ptfe-tubesthis question, but there was a surprising lack of relevant tags. I don't have the privileges to add new ones myself, so could someone create some appropriate tag(s) for this?

I've added a custom off-topic close reason. It needs another moderator to buy off, but it goes as follows (pretty much copied what you outlined in your question):


  Questions seeking troubleshoot help ("My printer was working, now it
  is not! Help!") must include information on 1) expected behavior, 2)
  actual behavior, and 3) what steps have been taken to troubleshoot
  already. Exceptions can be made after communication in Meta or Chat.


Thank you for bringing this up.

Is this approved, and if not, how can I help? :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TormodHaugene You can access Moderator Links -> Manage Off-Topic Reasons and approve/edit the suggested reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 Approved!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just got one that I would flag but they included a ton of information! http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3471/why-are-my-prints-so-defective/3475#3475 Which is frustrating as they included everything Except what I need to help them, the slic3r settings.. Verified I can see this listed. Thanks guys!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your custom close reason appears to have replaced the general "Because this question does not appear to be about 3D printing" one. Please bring that one back.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It also seems bad to have a "exceptions can be made [...]" option. The whole point about moderation on Stack Exchange is that it is community-driven and consensus based: if the community feels a question is appropriate even though it does not contain the required information, then they can choose not to vote to close it. No prior "permission" should be needed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Finally, I don't think we need this close reason. It would be more appropriate to use "unclear what you're asking" and add a comment saying *specifically* what information is missing (this also allows case-by-case judgement). Anyway, it's strange it's classified as "off-topic" because the questions are definitely on topic, they're just not clear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TormodHaugene (and tbm0115): any comment on my comments? I'd still like to have the default, generic "not about 3D printing" close reason; also "unclear what you're asking" is a much more logical category for this close reason than "off-topic".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi, @TomvanderZanden! Sorry for the slow response, I didn't see your comments until now. First off, I re-added the default off-topic reason you mention (although it will need another moderator's approval to take effect); it seems like the default closing reason disappeared once we created a custom one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115, could you please verify the recreation of the default off-topic reason? :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomvanderZanden: It seems we only can create custom closing reasons in the "off-topic" category, and not in e.g the "unclear" category. Personally, I too would like the closing option suggested above to be a subcategory of "unclear". As you suggest, I usually end up using the "unclear" closing reason, and then add a specific reason in the comments; however, if having a custom "off-topic" reason is useful for some users, I don't see any harm in allowing them to choose. Do you think we should remove the custom closing reason all together?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm fine with it staying. It fits with the example of Stack Overflow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TormodHaugene I've accepted the proposed off-topic reason. It'd be worth figuring out if there's a different tool for adding reasons under other categories.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115, yeah, we should. Thanks!


















As a newbie to 3D printing, I would like to get some feedback on a model I have created before sending it off to get printed. I don't yet own a printer, and I have never sent anything out to get printed before. I am interested in feedback about the following for example: 


Are any features I have included too big/small/angled/etc. to print reliably?
Have I set up my components correctly for optimal printing?
Are there any obvious structural issues (weak spots, press-fit issues, etc.)
Are there any obvious material/time saving things I should consider?
What materials are suitable/best for printing my model?
What questions should I ask the supplier before comitting?
Any other tips on getting my specific model to succeed.


Since Stack Exchange sites are generally not for "primarily opinion based" questions, I'm not sure if this site itself is a suitable location. 

Is the 3D Printing Stack Exchange site a suitable place to get feedback on a specific model before printing?

If not is there a Stack Exchange site similar to http://codereview.stackexchange.comCode Review, but for reviewing 3D models?

Update

I have not determined where to print the model b/c it likely depends on some of the answers (ex: printing technology, material, etc.) so I don't have someone I can work with directly yet. Also, I'd rather not choose the supplier as my first step b/c they will likely be biased towards whatever they can supply.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is 3D Printing SE appropriate for getting feedback on feasibility of a model?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question is *itself* primarily opinion based, as it asks for a recommendation of a website/forum. Moreover, answers would also inherently be transient, as the website recommended may become unavailable or go out of business. Maybe chat would be a better place to ask this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Any 3D forum would work. Keep looking till you find one _you_ like.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomvanderZanden I know... the irony was too great to resist asking anyway! :) Regardless, I have edited my question to be less opinion based. Also, since some SE sites seem to allow this (ex: code review) I wasn't sure if 3D Printing might be the same - since it's a relatively new field I would expect many "facts" about the subject to be merely opinion at this point anyway. I wasn't aware of chat, so I will look into that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can the place that will print it provide any advice? They may have general checklists that you can use, or they may be able to look at your model and let you know if they might have difficulty printing it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mbmcavoy Good idea, however, I have not determined where to print it yet b/c I have not determined all of the requirements (ex: printing technology, material).I have found some checklists on the websites of bigger providers and they have been a good start. However, there are still many things unanswered/unlclear... probably b/c I'm such a newbie.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might look into any local "maker spaces" where you can get direct access to machines and a community of people. if your project is large, maybe do smaller "test" pieces to see how they turn out first. Also, I've found it helpful to just watch the machine work as it prints certain features.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am +1 this question, because although it _is_ (still rather) opinion based, I think it is quite inquisitive, and I like the list of things to consider. The StackExchange stuff should have been a comment though, as they are not related to the question..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question, in its edited form, is more suited for meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just use a 3d printing facebook group. Also ditto on the Meta comment.


















I'll start off on a good note and congratulate everyone in the community for continually supporting each other. We have maintained a great answer rate here on 3D Printing SE with a answer rate of 96%. I believe this rate has been maintained since day one and it's hard to keep up, especially with fluctuations in user activity.

However, I would like to at least address an issue I've seen trending. Most of the issue comes from old posts and new, unfamiliar users to the SE network. Anyways, there is an abnormally high number of unaccepted answers.

Specifically, on 01/28/2017 9am Pacific US, there are 658 questions with answers, 258 of which have no answer accepted. This is an answer acceptance rate of about 40%.

Updated to 11/16/2018 10am CET, there are 1682 questions with answers (of a total of 1788 questions), 706 of which have no answer accepted. This is an answer acceptance rate of about 42%, although improved, it is still very low!



Now, I've done this in the past with little payout, but perhaps if we have more eyes on it moving forward. I have gone through the list of questions https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasaccepted%3Ano+answers%3A1here and commented on the question to ask the OP if any of the answers helped solve their situation. Something like this (see also meta posting /questions/303/do-we-have-standardised-commentsDo we have Standardised Comments?):


  Hello @[UserName], I noticed your question has been up for a while now. Have any of the answers below been able to solve your question? If so, would you mind accepting the appropriate answer. If not, what is missing so that we may help you further? Also, if you have figured it out on your own, you can always answer and accept your own solution. Thank you.


This should hopefully ping the user. Also, going through these questions may bring up questions that may need moderator attention/intervention.

Hopefully we can tackle this issue and get some other users more reputation in the process.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why don't people Accept Answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have seen your template a few times, and have started using a similar one myself, so good idea! :-) However, if they don't respond, should we somehow handle it further? Is it perhaps common to close answered questions where no answer has been accepted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's probably not a good idea to close a valid question, especially one with answers. I'll check around SE meta and let you know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have noticed that myself. There's not much we can do other than ping them. I'm guessing most people are not normal SO users and found us via our increasingly large google footprint. Then flag it as a duplicate as better questions are asked and accepted. Does the low acceptance effect our beta status? If not then we need not worry. But pinging is good.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@StarWind It doesn't directly affect our beta status, but the dormant reputation does. Of the 258 un-accepted questions, that ends up being 4386 reputation that just sitting there (3870 in answer reputation, 516 in accepting an answer). That could easily close a huge gap we have in "experienced" new users (200+ Rep). Plus, the more users feel like their work is being noticed with Rep, the more likely they are to continue to come back.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I tried it on http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1355/can-toothbrush-bristles-be-printed/1369#1369 I wanted to see if it would float to the top of the active list ( it did not) and I am happy to say that this did in fact work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I went down the list of questions and tried it on the questions with top upvotes. We will see what happens. Didn't go to crazy, didn't want to hit a spam filter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd just mention that 95 % answered is not such a big deal if you have 2.5 questions per day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a way for someone else to accept a well received answer if the OP never returns?  If so, I will formulate that into an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looks like there is not a way to "accept" and answer if the OP doesn't; but, there is a [lively discussion about this topic](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3669/would-it-be-possible-to-have-a-community-accepted-feature).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Accepting answers is a great thing. We, unfortunately, cannot force people to do it. The Stack Exchange network has a built in fall back on this, though, if you are wondering about the statistic. If an answer has an uptick on it, as far as the system is considered, the question is answered. An answer on a question just needs to be "well received", which to my understanding means it needs to be upvoted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I always think that these controls look too disabled and they are placed at the wrong position. After reading the answer, why should someone scroll back to the top and then check something that looks disabled? Make it a button that says "This answer solved my problem". The controls on Aviation.SE don't look disabled.


















Such a question would be too broad in terms of the number of answers possible, and too specialized to your particular model. The question would be of little value to the site as a whole, as nobody else will ever have the same question and so the answers will be useful only to you.

You should instead ask a question (or multiple questions) about a specific aspect you're unsure about, for instance whether a 1mm wall is thick enough to be printed with SLS, or whether a 35 degree overhang angle will print without supports, etc... This helps build a useful archive of questions, because people will be able to search for your question using general terms, rather than trying to find a question about "Model X".

There might be more than one place where you can ask about something...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure why you are arguing against your own answer. :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomvanderZanden, great advice if someone knows enough to know what things to ask.  There is a level of newbie that wouldn't have through yet about issues of wall thickness, overhang, warpage, etc.  Is there somewhere to direct them to that quickly explains the "n" first-order practicality concepts?  Maybe I'll pose this as a question....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cmm That kind of newbie should first do a google search and read a guide on the basics of 3D printing. There are already countless guides explaining how to get a model ready for printing (e.g. on 3Dhubs or Shapeways; basically any printing service has one). That kind of thing doesn't really fit well within the scope of a single answer. StackExchange isn't here to explain the basics to someone just barely getting started, it's there to help answer questions when you really get stuck despite doing your homework.


















There is a https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printing-powderprinting-powder and a https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/metal-powdermetal-powder tag.

The respective use of each tag, to date, is as follows:


https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printing-powderprinting-powder 2
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/metal-powdermetal-powder 1


One of the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printing-powderprinting-powder tagged questions is closed, and the other is also tagged https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/metal-powdermetal-powder, and both questions were about metal-powder.

Therefore, should the two tags be merged, as (currently), they both refer to the same thing, namely, metal powder?

I guess that, as there is other printing powders available, the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printing-powderprinting-powder tag could be left in-situ, but why not remove it, and if it is subsequently required, then let it be recreated?

[and/or]... remove the double tagging from this question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2667/why-cant-powder-based-3d-printing-techniques-create-enclosed-or-hollow-structurWhy can't powder-based 3D printing techniques create enclosed or hollow structures?

The Stack Exchange network is undergoing a transition to HTTPS for its sites, including 3D Printing SE.

This edit (from Community, it looks like), was probably scripted from SE Staff in attempt to fix content on Questions and Answers. Ultimately, I don't think this is worth migrating the SE Meta.

The point that I am trying to make is that a modification is shown as being made by "Song Khmer", when the question is listed in the unanswered list (I know *why* it is in the unanswered list - because it hasn't got an answer... :-) ). However, the modification by "Song Khmer" doesn't show up in the list of edits... so my question is, why does it say that it was modified by "Song Khmer" when in fact it wasn't..? This seems to me to be a site-wide bug, as it probably isn't only restricted to SE 3D Printing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have modified the question, to try to clarify the issueb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it now too late to migrate this question to SE.Meta? If so, could you notify me, that it is too late, in a comment, and I'll close/delete the question and repost on SE Meta. It is clearly a site-wide bug, and I'll report it as such, but I want to avoid cross-posting it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry it took so long to get back to you.

Use the flag "In need of moderation attention" and then specify why it should be migrated and where to. It doesn't always work, depending on the length of time that the question has been posted for and some other factors, but often it does work.

The answer to "Why?" is simply because it hasn't been set up by the moderators. Generally, a specific migration "pathway" has to be agreed between sites, I think, and only then is that particular SE site manually added as an option to the migration dialog. There is a post, from a few years ago, on SE.Arduino - See https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2340/why-does-the-migrate-dialog-only-list-arduino-metaWhy does the migrate dialog only list Arduino Meta?. 

Actually, I was mistaken, although, I am sure that I heard the above from someone, somewhere. Apparently, it is because SE 3D Printing is still in beta:


  I think it is because we are "only" a Beta site. Once we graduate, I
  think more migrating options become available.
  
  As a moderator, I can migrate to other sites, and have done in some
  cases. I usually ask their moderators first, and quite often they
  decline to accept them. However migration does happen.
  
  I think there is some rule that Beta sites don't get to migrate to
  other sites. I'm not quite sure why such a rule exists (it would seem
  more logical for it to be the other way).

I have just edited a new post, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4153/help-understanding-bridge-settingsHelp understanding bridge settings, so that the video would be "inlined" and playable in the post itself1.
However, the video does not show up, and only the raw link (https://youtu.be/HaeCBru3mOI) is displayed:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7jmC.png

This is the markup:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ukkfG.png

I have used the same markup method, for inlining the video clip as this post, https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/34121/is-atc-communication-subject-to-fcc-profanity-regulationsIs ATC communication subject to FCC profanity regulations?, on SE.Aviation:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/kgTCg.png

and there the video clip is inlined:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/LrHrI.png


TL;DR
Is video inlining disabled on SE.3D Printing, or is it because we are still beta?
If it can be enabled , then should/could it be enabled?
I personally think it would be useful to enable it, and save a few mouse clicks (and RSI) having to open the video in another tab/window etc. What do other people think?

Again, not sure though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good question, I lumped this into a more [general question](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296832/what-are-the-limitations-in-beta) and posted it on the Meta.StackExchange.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 - appears that it just needs to be enabled, according to Markshancock's answer below. The question is, now, I suppose, do we really need it? There are a number of questions appearing that include videos of people's issues, where the video will much more easily describe the issue, than a written description. "A video is worth a million words", so to speak...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps with regards to maintenance answers or troubleshooting print questions.

Regarding the "invisible modification", there is technically a modification made multiple times by the user Song Khmer (now destroyed). This user was posting nonsense to your question by copying text from your question and posting it as an answer.

The reason you probably did not see this in the revision history is:

1) it wasn't a direct edit to your question

2) I believe only moderators can see deleted posts.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/2VAiLs.png https://i.stack.imgur.com/2VAiL.pngclick here for full view of deleted posts

I'm pretty sure that anytime someone posts an answer or edits your question, the post raises the modified flag. In this case, when the user was posting answers it would properly flag the post. But, the flag remained even after the answers were deleted (there were 3 answers).

I agree with Erik.  This is something we need to improve on if we want the site to be viable and https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/10/21/when-will-my-site-graduate/Graduate from Beta.  Our Beta stats on http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438?phase=betaArea51 need improvement.

We are doing great on answering questions (94%) - GREAT JOB!!!
We have the quality answers and users, now we need quantity to meet our Beta Goals.

6,000 members is REALLY LOW.

Forbes that https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2016/04/25/wohlers-report-2016-3d-printer-industry-surpassed-5-1-billion/#1886464619a0"More than 278,000 desktop 3D printers (under $5,000) were sold worldwide..."  in 2016.  I am SURE that the majority of the owners are looking for answers.  In the past year since beta started, the 3D printing market has exploded (nearly 300K users); but, we have only added 50% do our user base (2K users).  WHY?

1.5 questions a day is (IMHO) DISMAL.

I am a member of a Facebook Group for just the Tronxy X1/X3.
It has 1,500 members (1/4 of what we have) and gets at least 10 questions/day.

So, what can we do?

Here is the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252762/what-can-be-done-to-promote-beta-sitessame question on Stack Exchange Meta and here are some SO Blog Posts on https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/05/31/community-promotion-ads/Community Promotion Ads and https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/08/23/a-recipe-to-promote-your-site/A Recipe to Promote your Site

So, Who is With Me?
Who wants this site THE SOURCE for 3D Printing questions and answers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder if we can use [community-ads](https://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/community-ads/info)


















From a traffic standpoint, people are more likely to stay on our site if they do not have to jump over to YouTube or any other video page to get the answer they're looking for from a video. As mentioned in the question, there are already a few use-cases for such a feature and I don't think it would hurt the visual appeal to the questions/answers.

However, it would be good to get some insight on disadvantages to the site in implementing this capability.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that if you want to keep people on the site, you should inline the video's. Else they get lost in the recommended video links and never return. So why has this not been enabled yet? @Greenonline ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I'm not sure @0scar. I *believe* that one posts a request to the sites Meta site (such as this youtube and the MathJax question) and hopefully someone "higher up" sees it and does something about it. I may need to check on that fact though, either in the Teacher's Lounge or SE.Meta (although we've already asked on SE.Meta for both issues and not much came of it). Is it because we are still beta? I doubt it. I might ask on Robotics how they got MathJax enabled.


















It actually seems like a user from 3D Printing SE - @markshancock - has asked this exact question https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296832/what-are-the-limitations-in-beta/296833#296833over at the general Meta. (Nice work, @markshancock!)

As pointed out by https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/296834/326646Jason Cs answer, it basically seems like we have to make a case why we need it to the SE moderation team, so that they can decide whether to activate it or not. 

In general, I think inlining videos makes sense for our site, since both the questions and answers often can end up with a video link with some descriptive text. Examples include questions of printers with strange behavior, and answers of how to do XYZ in Fusion 360 answered as a Youtube link. In both of these cases, what would otherwise be a mere "link only answer" would get much more substance.

Mark asked the Meta question, because we had discovered a few limitations on this beta site ([migration paths](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224/flagging-a-question-for-migration), and [inlining video](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/226/is-the-inlining-videos-capability-turned-off-on-this-site) among them). This question is to see *if* we should turn it on or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like @Greenonline mentioned, my question was not specifically directed toward inline video; but, my question did refer to it so they did talk about inline video in their answer.  Like Tormod mentions, we may need to provide a justification to turn it on.  The standard they noted was for it to be "only turned on if the community thinks it's necessary to improve the quality of a good portion of their question base".  I agree our site could benefit from inline video for some questions, but their standard is a pretty high bar.  Can we meet that?


















Are we at the limit on how big we can grow if we are only talking about "3D printers"


The 3D printing market is growing; but, it is still a pretty small niche compared to broader subjects like Programming, Engineering, Cooking, etc.
3D printers are really pretty simple compared to the other topics I mentioned above.  There aren't going to be as many questions.
There is a wide diversity of printers and most commercial (non RepRap) printers are supported by the individual manufacturer's forums.


That said, 753 visits/day (which is less than the number of people in the launch) and 2.1 questions/day are both pretty pathetic.  I think pretty much every 3D Printing forum, Facebook group, and YouTube channel WAY exceeds those numbers.

Only being able to ask and answer questions may also be a BIG limitation to our growth

3D Printing is part of the general Maker Culture and Makers want to not just ask; but, they want to show off and talk about what they make.  That is a lot of what I see on the other venues and that may be why we aren't getting as much traction here.

We need to find a way to channel the nubies and students here

I know nubies can be annoying; but, they ask more questions.  Lots of questions on StackOverflow come from students and nubies.



So, what can we do?


Broaden our scope from just "3D Printing".  The original Beta description is "tools and applications of 3D printing" which is a bit wider.  Maybe we should try to get more CAD, scanning, and maybe even CNC questions.
I wonder if Stack Exchange would be interested in getting a booth at our local Maker Faires.  They seem to be willing to partner money with effort and a booth is pretty cheap if we can muster the manpower.
Could we do a https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/237281/community-ads-faqcommunity-ad.  It looks like they may be https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/9028/community-promotion-ads-2017/9040taking requests now.
Maybe we could partner with someone to do a "Print-a-thon" or printing contest.  They could post the results and push the questions to us.
Find a way to connect to schools that have printing and/or CAD classes or after-school activities.
Connect into other student activities that use 3D printing whether it be art or things like Robotics Competitions.

Unfortunately, I think the course of action in doing so would require the start of a completely new SE site around Machining or Manufacturing. I'm not sure if we can change the name of the site without a unanimous decision within this community which defeats the purpose of the Area 51 system. In the interim, it's important to ask questions that YOU feel fit within this community others in the SE network. It's then on moderators and community members to say yay/nay on its merit in the community. This will help us growb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 The original Beta Description is "tools and applications of 3D printing" which provides a bit of wiggle room.  Also, the [Beta definition](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-beta) says that "“Beta” means that the site is still being defined and constructed,".  Maybe I'll ask on SE.Meta what latitude there is.


















I like the idea of incorporating product reviews into the 3dprinting StackExchange

Why?


It fits the Q&A model of Stack Exchange
Product pre-purchase questions are probably the number 1 question every new user wants to ask and needs to know (https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/159/is-there-any-way-to-prevent-endless-best-first-printer-postsas Ryan noted).  We should attempt to find a way to help provide that answer.
It provides a bridge to further questions.  Once they purchase a printer, they will have questions.
Since it is the number 1 question for new users, what a great way to draw them to the site.  When they search, they should find this site has the answer. 
It gives us a way to point people on forums here.  I often see links to reviews on forums.  Why can't those point here?  Once they are here, hopefully we will stay and contribute.
It would provide a great source of new content.  The number of new products and new users are growing at an exponential rate.  
If we do it right, it will help users and help move us forward on our Beta Goals.


Challenges 


We need to make sure the reviews are well done and are StackExchange style answers.  What I mean by that is that where they will likely have some opinion-based content, the primary content should be based primarily on objective qualities.  Maybe some sort of a "Style Guide", limitations on who can post, and peer review would help mitigate that.  I am not that familiar with how to manage that on a StackExchange.
Maybe this is a repeat of #1 - UNIFORMITY.  
Making sure the reviews doesn't become product advertisement / self promotions.

Here is an [example on the Aviation Blog](http://aviation.blogoverflow.com/category/product-reviews/)


















Do we want to add a BLOG to this site?
Blogs are another way of communicating things that don't fit the Q&A model.

Here is a good description of https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/06/23/blog-overflow/what a Blog is and how you can start one.

This post on the SuperUser Blog asking for http://blog.superuser.com/2012/02/09/are-you-interested-in-writing-for-our-blog/help with their Blog is helpful too.

+1 - As it seems a good idea. Not sure what would go in it though - do you have any concrete examples of blog ideas? 

I already have a (messy) https://gr33nonline.wordpress.com/blog, and I am not sure if I could also write a blog on here too. I wonder what the score is regarding duplicating personal blogs on to SE blogs? 



Content

An SE 3D print blog could be a good idea for Build Logs, for example, maybe. Or maybe a page that links to other people's superlative build logs, https://miscsolutions.wordpress.com/David Crocker's blogs come to mind.

Is the blog (unlike the SE Q&A site) allowed to contain links to cheap items/suppliers? Apparently, reviews are allowed, from https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/06/23/blog-overflow/Blog Overflow:


  Review a product. Reviews don’t fit the Q&A nature of the sites, but these rules don’t apply on the blog!  Between a review written by a random person on the internet and a review written by a user on the site who consistently gets a lot of upvotes, which review would you trust more?


This closed question would have fitted into a blog nicely: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4279/what-is-3d-printingWhat Is 3D Printing?



Concerns

So, yes, I think it would be worth starting one up and seeing how it goes... although I would be a little concerned about the regularity of posts: 


  Plan a schedule. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be posts on Tuesdays and posts on Fridays? You don’t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week.


and


  Pick a posting schedule and stick to it. It is easier to simply keep up from the get go than catch up if you fall behind.  Have a couple draft posts stashed away for a rainy day, ready to go that can be published if there is a lull.


Also, who would coordinate it? Are you putting yourself forward?


  Have someone holding the reins. This person doesn’t need to be the one writing all the posts, just someone that helps coordinate who is writing what and when it is getting posted.




However, it is a bit of a misfortune that Blog Overflow has a rather unfortunately acronym (as well as sounding like Bog Overflow).

I like all the ideas regarding content.  I am sure there are a lot of people in the group that could provide reviews for the printers they have and/or build logs for the printers they build/improved.  I am wondering on how to manage/vet that.  Is there a place where people could post and vote on BLOG topics so that everything is not on you?  Ex: Post an ongoing META question "What posts would people be willing to write for the BLOG".  Some sort of an example and/or style guide would help.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@markshancock - yes, a style guide *would* be needed, I guess, for consistency's sake... although everyone has different writing styles. Maybe *this* question would suffice, w.r.t. ideas for the blog. But like I said above, getting people on board *could* be an issue. This Meta site seems to not to be terribly well frequented.


















The description of blogs you've cited is 6 years old. Unfortunately, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291741/we-will-no-longer-be-hosting-blog-overflowblogs have since been discontinued.

I have noticed very few people up-vote questions or answers in our community.

Why?

There are lots of metrics on how well a group is doing


Visits per day
Questions per day
Answers per question


These are all traffic dependent and hard to fix on out own; but, one we can fix is VOTES.  

The reward system that is baked into Stack Exchange is Reputation and much of Reputation comes from good questions and answers.  This is determined by votes.

I don't think this is working well for our community.  Even the TOP QUESTION often get no votes or at the most just a few - even though they sometimes have over 100 views.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/uc5ZK.jpg

One of the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/11/how-do-i-give-3d-printed-parts-in-pla-a-shiny-smooth-finishmost viewed questions in our community had over 3700 views and had just 34 up votes.  That is better; but, still pretty low compared to both the view count and the response a top question would receive on other communities.

Without up votes, it can be very discouraging to people that put the time and effort into answering questions.  If we want to grow our community, we need to put more effort into hitting the up arrow every time we think that a question or answer was worth the read.  Remember questions and answers are what fuels the community.  Lets pay our fuel bills.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why don't members like our questions and answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is true! Votes are also an great tool from separating great questions from those that doesn't make a lot of sense.

People clearly view the questions and the answers.  An up-vote requires virtually no effort.  Yes, the change in the Subject was intended to draw attention, curiosity, views (and hopefully) responses.


















That action didn't appear in the moderator activity history, so I'm not exactly sure how it was handled. Regardless, I agree and have deleted the comment.

A user from SE Meta recommended that we "feature" posts from our Meta that need more general user visibility and possibly draw more users into Meta.

no matter if we are close to graduation or not, i'd like to submit this one as my proposition

can be color/gray/BW and still well recognized
can be simplified (pixelate) to create favico (min size 8x8 pixels ;)

Another colour would be better, to be able to *clearly* distinguish the 3D Printing SE tabs from all of the other SE tabs that I have open. Raspberry have red, SO is orange/yellow, electrical is orangey-red. Someone told me once that the human eye is most receptive to green (although I am not sure if that is true), and from a distance - when reading writing on a white board for example, from the back of a class - red was the most feint, whereas green was the clearest.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5now i get your nick :P but in terms of colors - it's just a proposition aligned to SE colors nothing else. it's just a form but the content is this stylized 3D, layers, common cup form and hot-end as a steam :)


















Seeing as I'm 20 days late to this question, you probably understand that I'm not very active at the moment myself. (At least, I'm inactive for longer periods of time.) With Ryan gone for almost a year now, that often leaves @tbm0115 as the only moderator on this site.

In other words, we could do with another moderator or a change of moderators (Ryan and perhaps me also).

On the plus side, we are getting more and more users, which makes the community handle a lot of cases by itself.

There is no tag created for leveling (or levelling, or bed-leveling for that matter). So, I would recommend taking some of your top search results for leveling, of your results, if any have available tags (not all 5 tags have been used) then add/created the [bed-leveling] tag.

Overall, this is a good catch on potentially improving the tagging here on 3DPrinting SE.

My flag history shows that 


6 "spam" flags aged away without review.
3 "rude/abusive" flags aged away without review.
2 "not an answer" flags were raised in February and are still pending. It's now April.


All this suggests that current moderators do not have enough time to handle flags. I think the site should try and get a couple more.

It appears that those communities have more active members/moderators that are missing in the 3D Printing SE. You raise the waiving of raised flags, but there is much more going on. E.g. many topics with correct answers do not have accepted answers, questions do not receive much vote ups, nor do good answers. Accepting valid answers may also may be a task for moderators, but I understood that is not technically feasible. It is fair to start a discussion on this problem, but I think that there are too few active membersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, I've had 4 out of 8 spam flags age away, but apart from that 24 other types of flags were dealt with reasonably promptly


















Recently, a couple of posts have caused concern about the risks involved with the advice given.
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5768/should-i-print-in-a-well-ventilated-area/5769#5769This answer, to the question https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5768/should-i-print-in-a-well-ventilated-area/Should I print in a well ventilated area? was recently flagged along with the comment:

The answer seem to suggest that exposure to dangerous fumes may not be dangerous after all. Do we have a policy for erroneous health advice? Do we tolerate it relying on users using common sense when reading advice on the internet? Do we remove it?

Similarly, there was https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5869/danger-in-3d-printing-over-a-lithium-ion-battery/6009#6009another answer to another question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5869/danger-in-3d-printing-over-a-lithium-ion-battery/Danger in 3D printing over a lithium ion battery, that raised some eyebrows over its possible dangerous outcome.
So, I am just throwing this out there:
Should we have, or do we have (and if so, what is it) a policy for [potentially] dangerous advice?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Health and Safety?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems like a better question for the Stack team. There is nothing stated in their Terms of Service that I can see that covers this. I'm not sure what the reprimands would be if proven that an answer lead to someones death or injury. Maybe ask [law](https://law.stackexchange.com/)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 Isn't there a (hidden) disclaimer or something for all the advice given here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 - OK, thanks, I'll post something on SE.Meta later.


















Some new moderators were appointed yesterday, see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/pro-tem-moderator-announcementPro Tem Moderator Announcement. Hopefully the new moderators can keep up the sterling work that the previous moderators have provided up to now... :-)

After a minor marathon session of clearing the backlog, all flags have now been cleared. Hopefully in a way that keeps everyone happy:


Some (one or two) questions were migrated to Engineering or Blender, after requests were thrown over to moderators on other sites, and some others were left "as is", as they have garnered some answers here on 3D Printing. 
Some short/terse answers (which were useful/informative) have been converted to comments, others (which were not so helpful) were deleted.
Some sprawling comments threads/chats have been shortened/deleted
Some "additional information" comments have been moved into the questions to which they pertain
Some "issue resolved" updates to questions have been turned into community wiki answers


No information has hopefully been lost. If anything seems to have gone missing, please leave a comment below.

The only downside is that many old post came back to top again, I wish SE could let moderators edit questions without bringing them to the top again.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - yes, that is an issue that I came up against on SE.Arduino. Whilst I liked to go around fixing typos and mistakes in old questions, just to improve the general presentation of the site, it brought those posts to the top of the 'Active" list, and I received some angry complaints about making "noise" - which was rather unfortunate. You are right, it would be good if there was a way of editing that prevented the post becoming active (such as a "Non-active edit" checkbox or button), although that might lead to other issues (secret/stealth edits).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - I'll raise a issue on SE.Meta later about it, but I doubt that much will come of it, as there would be development work required for potentially little gain (apart from making the site look tidy). It is, indeed, a bit of a conundrum.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I realize that this may not get attention from SE as their reasoning would be that having active users and active moderators should prevent this from happening as edits should be made soon after posting of the question/answer. But it might be a handy feature in some cases, thanks for bringing it to SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - Please see [Editing without bumping](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310860/editing-without-bumping) :-)


















One thing that I have noticed, especially after having been away for nearly a year, is how the mood of the site has changed, ever so slightly. It is just that recently there seem to be a bit more of the "Did you google first, before asking here" type comments (accompanied by a vote to close), in particular to newbie questions, or at least questions from those new to SE, but maybe not so new at 3D printing. I don't remember these types of comments so much prior to a year or so ago.

While I agree that people need to do research, or at least demonstrate that they have done a bit, if people are coming here and asking an honest question (which is not a lazy homework related - and let's face it, there are not many, if any, 3D printer related homework questions) and that question is from someone genuinely interested in 3D printer with a tangible problem, then try to answer it, or at least provide a helpful comment.

Seeing as we are not-quite-desperate-for-users but have an issue with user retention, then we should really not be  throwing google in their face - no matter how frustrating a question may seem, or how obvious the answer appears to an old hand. Do we really want them running off to Reddit, or Quora, or Ask (Jeeves) or (god forbid) Yahoo answers, or some other place? Or is it better that we get them to stay here?

Believe me when I say that I know how irritating it can get, I have been there myself. I ended up not spending much time on SE.Arduino, for that same reason - in the end most of the questions started to seem nonsensical, repetitive and idiotic... because I had seen the same topics asked over and over again. I realised that I had to take a deep breath and step back a little - just because I knew the answer and had helped too many people before with the same issue, it didn't mean that someone new would not come along tomorrow and ask the same thing. 

Yes, they should have checked google first, and yes, they should have seen the duplicate question had already been asked. However, maybe they didn't have the luxury of time to spend hours googling, or maybe they had not used the right search terms, or maybe English isn't their mother tongue, or whatever. However, it didn't mean that they needed to be made to feel daft. 

After all, if someone asks a question here, it probably isn't because they want to wind us up and make us angry - why would they do that? And it can't be judged as lazy, because, let's face it, it takes longer to formulate and ask a question on SE than it does to search for something on Google.

A couple of friends of mine, independently of eachother, sent me this image which, while it made me laugh, also (rather sadly) sums up the "Why are you asking me that?" mentality that StackExchange is perceived as having by the wider techy internet community - this is not a good reputation to have..!

https://i.stack.imgur.com/La323.png

So, all I am trying to say is, when you see a question asked by someone with a rep of 1, be nice and try to encourage them to stay, rather than scaring them off as soon as they set foot through the door. Don't forget it is probably their first question here and are quite nervous as to how they will be perceived (as one generally is when approaching a new group of people and having to ask something).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah that's a feeling I got when I first started posting here. My answers were usually picked apart hard. Oh well don't answer so stupidly. I remember I post a joke once on topcoder and got torn a new one. 7 years later still remember it and have never gone back. While I was not actually torn a new one, here, a text format can easily come across as hostile and aggressive without very strong soft skills. The bigger issue is these non engineer types are not used to a non forum style website. A good guide and on-boarding process would help us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For example, I didn't handle @0scar friendly jab at my hasty answer yesterday as softly as I could have even after numerous edits. My chiding of his joke being in the wrong section could have turn off a newer member. Which sure I meant that as a tit for tat friendly jab back, but many wouldn't have seen it that way. Especially when you factor the international audience.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@StarWind0 - Hmmm, yes, I saw that yesterday, and it _could_ have come across as a bit of a moody comment, which I am sure it was not meant to be. The problem is that text is not expressive enough, especially in hastily written, and character constrained, comments, and it is easy for something to be taken badly or appear to be a little harsh (the same can happen in email where the number of characters isn't limited). I am not one for emoticons and emojis but a smiley face _can_ help, now and again. Also, the _this-is-not-a--forum thing_ is true too, and can take a while to get used to.

Additional points of note
The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1354/graduation-of-this-community/1355#1355in this answer, to https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1354/graduation-of-this-community“Graduation” of this Community:

A number of 10k+ users ( n > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
A number of 3k+ users ( n > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

The final hurdle
The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/474/congratulations-ethereum-is-graduatingCongratulations! Ethereum is graduating!, is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link (https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sitesGraduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.

No graduation, but losing the Beta label...
Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label. Please see https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/331708/congratulations-to-our-29-oldest-beta-sites-theyre-now-no-longer-beta?cb=1Congratulations to our 29 oldest beta sites - They're now no longer beta!.

I believe the one on the left would be more intuitive if the scale went from 0 to 4, instead of 1.5 to 4. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks :-) I know what you mean (it's misleading as it stands - over exaggerating the change), However, I tried it with different scales...but it becomes (more or less) a straight line (which is even less meaningful). I'll add some code (at some point) to make the individual scales adjustable in the config file (I thought that I already had, but I clearly haven't, or the changes have been lost - I'll have to go through the code more carefully later).


















imho that could be a post-processing category/tag.

After a quick_ glance at the questions tagged `postproduction`, I can't see what the difference is. Maybe they should be merged?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yeah, that is a good idea. The output is same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've posted an answer, which maybe should have been a question, see [here](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/151/naming-convention-for-tags-with-camelcase-or-pre-fix#answer-269)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline In relation to my post in your Meta question, this would be a great example of Post-Processing since you're altering the physical dimensions of the material. It's similar to removing clamping stock when machining a part out of a mill or lathe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tbm0115 -  Nice one. Thanks, done.


















Based on the answers already posted, I am changing https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/postproductionpostproduction to https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/post-productionpost-production, I have only just seen this and it immediately looked odd.

Also, what is the difference between https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/post-productionpost-production and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/post-processingpost-processing, or are they synonyms? https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/post-productionpost-production has no description whatsoever.

Can you make the change, or is this something that only high-rep users can do? I'm not sure (not without checking). If you can't then tell me and I'll do it. You should also probably post an answer (here) stating that change is going to be made - so that there is a record of it (in an answer and not in an ephemeral comment)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that I can't do this yet.


















I was running out of space in the comments, so I'm just moving this to a full blown answer.
According to the magic Moderator portal, we should be around 2,350 in visits per day. Also, my post was a little over a year and half ago.
To elaborate on my original post that @Greenonline attributed and reiterate the points:
Accept Answers
I have mentioned the https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/174/accepting-unanswered-questionsaccepted answers issue before as well in a separate post, but there are currently https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasaccepted%3Ano%20answers%3A1571 unaccepted-answer questions WITH at least 1 answer available out of 1,467 as of 06/06/2018 11:12pm UTC-7 (Pacific). That's almost 40% of our content ripe for reputation. That equates to 8,565 reputation points just by purely accepting one of the available answers.
I've periodically used the link above to retroactively remind users that they can approve of an answer. There's nothing wrong with reminding users in the comments, so long as it is asked appropriately. If you don't know how to word it, feel free to steal my wording from the post above.
Vote
I'm not the best at remembering to vote, but I typically vote both on the answer(s) that helped me AND the question(s). I think questions easily get overlooked in the voting process, but it does help our newer visitors.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One of the ways people can assist with the unaccepted answer is to post a small blurb as a comment to the answer itself back to the OP, that being something like, "*If this answers your question, please select the check mark to the left showing as such.*" This isn't asking for points, necessarily, but rather is an attempt to clean up the unanswered questions. I believe for what is shown as "unanswered", SE takes into account answers which have been upvoted as having an answer, whether the OP has clicked the check-mark or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You are correct about the questions often being overlooked, and I think that it is for that reason, that the electorate badge requires 25% of votes being on questions, and the same (or stricter) applies to Vox Populi too, I believe but (after re-reading the badge description) I might be wrong, although I do *vaguely* remember reading a meta post that advised only voting for questions (when I first joined SE years back) in order to get the badges in the most efficiently possible way.


















I think the way to go would be to migrate the answer (and its comments) to comments of the question.

As for Toonis' answer in the comment. I don't think that there is a way to create an answer for someone else. Functionality like that could be abused to achieve higher reputation. It's up to Toonis to create his/her own answer.

However, it is seen site-wide where users will create an answer attributing to the comment of another user. I think it is unspoken law that you remove your answer if the user ever creates their own answer. Ultimately, there are some users that just don't care about the reputation, so they would prefer to use the comments instead.

So, don't be afraid to create your own answer off of someone else's comments. Having explicit answers in the system will only make our site stronger.

Hit me up on https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/49795/the-heat-elementThe Heat Element chatroom (specifically for 3D Printing Mods) and I can walk you through these steps.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, I think I understand what you mean. First, convert the answer and comments to comments of the original question, and then hope that the new user reposts the question. Then wait a while for Tonnis to submit an answer (and/or submit my own answer and delete when Tonnis submits the answer). Alternatively, we could just repost the question and answer (from Tonnis's comment) and mark both as a Community Wiki - just thought of the latter idea - but still do the convert to comments anyway. Regardless, *either way*, the convert to comments must be done first. Got it! :-)


















Please note; Due to its very nature, this post is very subjective and is not intended to be a definitive list of categories. It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask "How should we move forward?"

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...
Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issuesPost Closing Issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?
So, with respect to our https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicOn-topic page, which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking ("why has my question been closed?"/"why is X not allowed"),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words "https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=askask" and "https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=topictopic". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked.
A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.
Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read every question and answer listed below fully - there may be some suggestions that I have missed. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).
Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more inclusive.
BTW, a useful post to read is https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-should-our-documentation-containWhat should our documentation contain?
Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

1 WRT Components, and taking the https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/177/why-was-the-question-about-thermistors-migratedthermistors meta question as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we could theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc.
2 The same applies to the Misc/Anything 3D related, in particular the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/54/what-is-the-best-way-to-connect-3d-printed-partsConnecting 3D parts question. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question is pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.
3 Also under Misc/Anything 3D related, Coding Ultimaker Cura is a SO type question, but it is also 3D printer specific

Additional suggestions in the future
Instead of posting a new question, it might be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.
However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.

I've thought about this in the past as well. I'd be curious if anyone from the Stack Team has any issues with the following format:

1) This functionality needs to be explicitly outlined in our On-Topic page!

2) Any of these types of questions should be created by a moderator and immediately "converted to wiki" (see mod options)

3) The question should outline an expected format for the following answers. For example, in the case of "Best Printer" questions:

**Make**: {Enter Manufacturer}

**Model**: {Enter Model #/Name}

**Type**: {Select tag: [FDM,SLA,SLS,DLP, etc]}

**Pros**: {Provide details of benefits}

**Cons**: {Provide details of downfalls}


4) Answers MUST follow the outline provided in the question or risk being deleted.

5) (Optional) Answers should be converted to wiki
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I like this type of idea, especially the template. Two issues I have with blogs: they aren't that easy to find (the blog idea was floated by Markshancock last year, [Should we start a 3D Printing BLOG?](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/236/should-we-start-a-3d-printing-blog), but nothing seemed to come of it, unfortunately - maybe due to my second issue), and; they can get overly wordy (not necessarily a bad thing but also people can get put off by the idea of having to write reams of text). Using a template means that the information will be succinct and to-the-point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline That's why I recommend that moderators primarily be the initiators of these types of questions, to ensure the tone is set with the template. Otherwise it becomes a s**t show of garbled information.


















https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/8t0ivj/common_3d_printing_materials_methods_to_suitably/Common 3D printing materials/ methods to suitably replicate (w durability) this injection molded Polypropylene item?

Please advise. As I am new to 3D Printing and SE Rules can get pretty restrictive on whats allowed or not and would be hard for me to argue or decipher its validity for this SE.   
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could this Printing Material Recommendation Question be or shaped to be valid on 3D SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whether it is valid or not is a good question. What is actually on-topic is (sort of) up for debate at the moment, see [Game plan - What is on-topic?](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topic?cb=1). Unfortunately, I don't know whether it is on-topic or not, but hopefully someone does. If you don't get an answer to this question after a few days, I'd post it anyway. If it gets closed, so be it, but you never know, it may be well received.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline - Wow! People are quick to attack questions, but when someone asks ahead of time, there's no guidance. Go figure. PS: I hate the time & energy spent on detailing a question, put all references and then get shot down.


















I was thinking about your question this morning, and I saw that there were no replies. SE 3D Printing is quite a small site and there aren't an awful lot of regulars here - but there are just enough who can give great answers, but not everyone ventures here, into meta.
I think that you should ask the question, it does seem on-topic. If it is well presented (without typos) and has the necessary detail, then it should be OK.  It is usually only very poorly worded, poorly formatted and overly broad questions, where little thought and research has been done beforehand, which are shot down in flames... :-)
Looking at your Reddit post, it seems ok, but it could be worth relevant quoting parts from those links that you listed (as links die over time and the information that you refer to could be lost), and show why or why not, you think certain options may or may not be suitable. Your question could also appear to be opinion-based or broad - so it could be better to narrow down your question to a point or two (or three).
If it does end up getting closed, which hopefully it won't as you do appear to have put some thought into it, you will be provided with guidance as to how to edit and improve it and make it more suitable for StackExchange.
I wouldn't worry too much, even the best of us have bad post days sometimes... it's not a big deal :-)
Also, think about it this way, the time that you take formulating and crafting your question will be well spent as it should help clarify your question in your own mind. Often, I have found, whilst writing and clarifying a question, that I had actually mis-understood the whole issue in the first place, and sometimes re-working a post can help me find my own solution (especially when using peoples comments to adjust the original post), or at the very least, help me get my head around the issue.

TL;DR - Don't over think this, just post your question :-)

Ah, I think I see, and I may have initially misunderstood.  I had understood (in the chat) that you wanted a tag for each make/model, but, in fact, you would rather link each make/model back to a printer type, so

P3Steel -> Prusa
Kossel -> Delta


Is that right? 

If so, then I am not so sure. I would want to keep some of the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/p3steelp3steel questions to be specific to P3Steel and not just general https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prusaprusa issues.

Likewise, some https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kosselkossel issues are specific to the Kossel and not to all https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/deltadelta printers.

In some cases I would agree that your reasoning is correct, but not in all cases. In the cases where you are right (such as the example that you cite), then the question would just need retagging correctly, but not require linking all of a particular printer's make/model related questions (via the synonym-ising (?) of the tag) back to that particular printer's type.

Does that make sense? Have I understood correctly?

As an example, if you have a generic question about a ANet A2 printer, that actually concerns all cartesian printers, but especially Prusa, you would have to manually tag that question https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aneta2aneta2 and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prusaprusa and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cartesiancartesian, so that it gets grouped in such a way, where Cartesian, Prusa and AnetA2 are subsets of the previous (super)set. I don't think you can internally link the tags, if you see what I mean, that mechanism doesn't exist.  

Likewise, if you have a generic question about a ANet A2 printer, that actually concerns all prusa printers (but not necessarily all cartesian printers), you would have to manually tag that question https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aneta2aneta2 and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prusaprusa and maybe https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cartesiancartesian.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually I meant both, but I can see now what you mean. So let's make tags for all printers (e.g. AnetA2 is not there, but we have specific questions for them) and I thought that we could also link AnetA2 tag to e.g. Prusa as it is a Prusa clone printer or maybe better `cartesian` (e.g. mech. types are Cartesian, Delta, SCARA and Polar). Maybe I misunderstood the synonyms, but I thought of it as mathematical collections, so AnetA2 is a type of a collection Cartesian, but I'm beginning to understand that it is just rewording, correct?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think that the tagging works like that. You would have to manually tag that question [AnetA2] and [Prusa] and (maybe) [cartesian], so that it gets grouped in such a way, like using sets, and subsets. I don't think you can *internally* link the tags, if you see what I mean, that mechanism doesn't exist.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So basically the answer is that we need tags for every printer brand/type, and if the problem is more mech. type specific, we also need to add that?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, that's right :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5done, I've put two examples


















I agree, there's not much difference inherently between these two tags. However, we could try to direct the use of https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/materialmaterial to more general (not necessarily 3D printed material) vs the obviously focused https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/print-materialprint-material.

Or we could just merge them into the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/print-materialprint-material tag (my vote).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I might not merge them, as there is one (or two), out of 33, that aren't filament related, i.e. [How to reuse modelling bases for the Stratasys uPrint SE Plus?](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1471/how-to-reuse-modelling-bases-for-the-stratasys-uprint-se-plus)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which SE sites should we target with community ads?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 - Thanks :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My general thinking of how we could do these ads is if the targeted site has a regular icon (like the raspberry in Raspberry Pi), we could show a print head putting down lines just about finishing the icon. Then also, we could stagger the colors of the icon being drawn to conform with the "general" colors of SE. Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and EE.SE would be very easy, I think. Other ones may be a bit more challenging, or we might possibly need to go a different direction with them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 - that sounds good. Im not much of an artist. But....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... @darth pixel is quite a good designer, maybe he is up to [the challenge](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76/community-ads-lets-make-2d-ads-for-ourselves#comment440_153)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I pinged darth pixel to see if they would offer up the stuff they had on here from before, but got nothing back. His work is what got me thinking about what I wrote above.


















It got too long to fit in a comment:

That does seem sort of reasonable. A DIY printer should be one that has been sourced from various parts. Or should that also include (or be exclusively) DIY designs? I mean, DIY means Do It Yourself, so a commercial kit, is literally a DIY printer, even though it is following a recognised design. It may seem a pedantic point over semantics but what is classed as DIY? Is it:


A true home brew, DIY design? And everything made from scratch with a lathe and possibly another 3D printer?
Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github and printing the plastic parts yourself
Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but buying the plastic parts (because you don't yet have a printer)
Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but a complete kit
Buying a commercial printer available as a kit, in kit form.


To me, there is not much difference between the last two, if the commercial printer is derived from a RepRap. Even 2 and 3 are just as DIY as each other, really.

So, just to play devil's advocate, here are four real word scenarios... 


Would you class a P3Steel as a DIY https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/diy-3d-printerdiy-3d-printer tag or as a printer-kit https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printer-buildingprinter-building tag if the frame was purchased as a kit from Poland, but the rest of it was sourced separately from various places, such as Chinese eBay vendors? 
Likewise, a Kossel, whose plastic parts were bought from a eBay vendor and then the aluminium struts were cut to length in the back streets of Bangkok - would that be a commercial kit (because the plastic parts were available commercially), or DIY? 
Also, a Wilson II, whose plastic parts were from MJRice (the designer of the Wilson), but the aluminium came from a cottage industry aluminium extruder in Vietnam, who you had had to walk miles to find. Commercial kit or DIY tag?
Now, twisting it slightly... What about a complete Wilson II kit? Where the entire frame and kit has been purchased from an eBay vendor, or MJRice. Is that commercial or not? 


There seems to be a fine line between the last two. We might need to be very specific in the tag definitions if people aren't going to get confused.

If, all four examples are DIY then fine. If none of them are, because the plastic parts were purchased, then ok, we have a very strict definition of DIY.

Just for completeness, the first three scenarios are my personal purchasing experiences, where I considered them as DIY printers.

Now, to be fair to your question, I think I know what you mean. You are referring to printer kits from established manufacturers that are available pre-built, or as kits. Is that right? I just want to clarify what defines a commercial kit and a DIY kit.

Does that make sense? I might have got a bit carried away.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would pull the line between 4 and 5: as soon as you buy a complete kit, it is no longer DIY. But if you Frankenstein a Prusa i3Mk1 with an e3D hotend, it is a good ammount of DIY. The thing why I want the separation is for troubleshooting: the more alteration from a proven/comercial design there is, the less experience with the base model helps. For example the Creality printers seem at times to have weak couplings to the PTFE tube. TronXY skips on an eccentric nut on their printers, making other means of tightening the rollers needed... all that is endemic to their printers, not the...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...general overall design.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree totally with your sentiment, well, 95% of me does. But surely some of the issues that are experienced by the commercial kit builders, will also be the same as those experienced by true DIY builders, so whilst tagging them as by their brand/model/Marque is a very good idea, shouldn't they also be tagged with (or retain) the "superset" tag of DIY? Oh, hold on, you are saying that issues *specific* to certain commercial kits shouldn't have the DIY tag? So long as those issues really don't crop up in other DIY printers, then yeah, I think that I agree. Don't just take my word for it though


















A couple of points:

Asking for a machine to solve a specific problem, or software which can do something 'specific' is not really a shopping question, so long as the question is asked in the right way. We do need to avoid subjective questions, but sometimes this can be the result of a misunderstanding (i.e. find me a non-CN supplier of this budget Chinese printer {which also seems to be a decent product}).

Topics which bridge into something like Electronics can be useful because the field is very large, and EE.SE makes an assumption of near degree level expertise. Useful answers here could be more 'off the shelf' routes to achieving what could potentially be fairly 'textbook' to someone with the right background.

Same with making trivial changes to firmware, using a complex software tool for a trivial task, etc. If the task is common, relevant and bounded then a 'hand-holding' answer here will be much more valuable/findable than pushing questioners to a more specific site. Once people move from trivial use of these tools they may well end up needing to self-educate before they reach a point that EE.SE, or SO will accept their questions.

We're at a difficult point between a mass market consumer product, and emerging tech. The IoT site has similar challenges.

I just need to remove the question mark(s). 2nd point, yep totally. If it relevant to printing then it should stay. Would you agree that the same applies to compiling code and printing related IDE help too (which may in the past have been shunted to SO)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was tempted to be more restrictive with compile/ide, but again we're potentially dealing with people who need hand-holding for common tasks...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah exactly, and they are more likely to get a 3D printing oriented response than they would on SOb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've added Electronics explicitly to the list (I'd forgotten that, or assumed it was in components or DIY), also added Medical and Health and Safety


















At the moment there are two tags related to fans:


https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/print-fanprint-fan
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fansfans


If you look at the topics there is no distinction which fans are meant, this must be read in the questions.

Should we create separate tags for specific fan applications?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have specific "fan" tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, I see what you mean... If both tags have just been used at random and neither are consistently used for one type or another, then it would seem to make sense to either: merge them all together under [tag:fans], or; separate them out, as your answer suggests. Looking at it, [tag:fans] seems to be a random tag, with no description and only has 3 questions


















There aren't that many topics labelled with either one of the existing tags, so re-tagging will not be a problem.

Indeed these tags are generic tags and do not cover the range of fans specifically for the application they are used for. There are 3 types of applications for fans in 3D printers, 


electronics cooling fans (board/stepper/stepper drivers cooling), 
part cooling fans (filament cooling after deposition), and 
cold end cooling fans (extruder cold end cooling).


How about making 3 categories and re-tag? (in the same order as the previous list)


https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/electronics-fanelectronics-fan,
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/part-cool-fanpart-cool-fan (or https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filament-fanfilament-fan or https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/print-fanprint-fan), and
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/extruder-fanextruder-fan.


Alternatively, we could just use a single tag and let the poster make sure that he explains clearly which fan is used.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It *seems* like a *very* good idea, but I can't help worrying if it is making things over complicated. Although, if all of the fan questions just end up getting jumbled together under [tag:fans], or the more restrictive [tag:print-fan], then that would seem quite messy too, and not very helpful...  Let's see if we get some more feedback before changing anything just yet... Also, [tag:print-fan] seems to be only for cooling electronics, so a "print cooling fan" specific tag seems sensible - if there are any printed part cooling fan questions? "Extruder-fan" seems sensible too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[tag:part-cool-fan] would be for printed parts, yes? Sounds good. What would the electronics cooling fan tag be called? Currently it is [tag:print-fan], which is neither here nor there really. [tag:electronics-fan] might be a good name. So what would plain "fan" be a tag for?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline With the last I meant electronics cooling fans, I'll update the answer and make the 2nd list in the same order as the first list.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline print fan was, I assumed, incorrectly described. I updated the wiki to describe it as part cooling.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SeanHoulihane - Yes, good move. I must admit I was confused initially, upon seeing your edit, as I thought that this (the fan tags) had been all sorted out, but obviously not :-)


















Frequently you'll find that you type similar comments, but depending on inspiration and time, the comments differ. It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).

Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.

Where applicable, replace <username> with the actual user name of the poster being addressed

I've been fixing posts for a while for many different editorial reasons, but one of the main issues is the lack of a non-breaking space between the amount and the units.

Today however I came across this article, https://www.engadget.com/2010/12/16/32-gb-versus-32gb-almost-everyone-is-writing-it-wrong/?guccounter=132 GB versus 32GB: Almost everyone is writing it wrong, by chance - I was actually looking up SD cards - and it summed up things pretty well. I'll let you read it. 

However, the rules are as follows:


non-breaking spaces (&nbsp; / ALT+0160) before all SI units, including bytes


Except:


degrees (°), minutes ('), and seconds (") (for angles)


See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#General_rulesWikipedia: International System of units - Lexicographic conventions :


  The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21 kg, 7.3×102 m2, 22 K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%) and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C). Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°, ′, and ″), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.


I must admit that I didn't realise that it applied to °C and %, as well... oops!



In a comment, &nbsp; does not work (nor does any HTML). Try ALT+0160 - Or on Windows Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar (or on a Mac, type Option+Spacebar).

Note that it is best to stick with &nbsp; in answers as the other options are impossible to see when editing - so the &nbsp; serves as a nice visual clue.

Test: 10 mmb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BG100 Try `ALT+0160`? Or on Windows Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar (or on a Mac, type Option+Spacebar)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In other words: it is correct _and expected_ to show a space between the value and unit, but it is not correct to allow the space to break to a new line. If you're going to be pedantic enough to edit a post to add those spaces, you should also be certain to get the non-breaking part right. In situations where you can't easily put in a correct non-breaking space, you may be better off being wrong by omitting the space than being wrong by allowing the units to break from the value. Don't forget that line breaks may happen in different/unexpected places depending on screen size or browser widthb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JoelCoehoorn - If you put a non-breaking space, and the line is too short, then both the quantity and the units will drop onto the next line. What situation were you thinking of? It's not clear why you wouldn't be able to (unless you mean in the comments).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline Not all people doing this edits know about ` `. That you won't really be in that situation is kind of the point, but I ran out of space for "In other words, do this all the time"


















For graduation, voting is the key to get a growing community that wants to come back to post questions and answers! 

According to SE.3D Printing user stats at https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printingArea 51 we need more questions and a solid group of users to assist in moderating the site. 

The amount of questions are hard to control, but could be increased by the avid users by posting questions and answer those themselves (e.g. about problems you encountered while gaining experience in 3D printing, this is perfectly legal and documents the gained experience to be shared with others). Another aspect is the solid group of users. According to the stats page:


  We recommend: 
  
  
  150 users with 200+ rep (currently 130 users with 200+ rep) 
  10 users with 2,000+ rep (currently 10 users with 2,000+ rep) 
  5 users with 3,000+ rep (currently 7 users with 3,000+ rep)
  


Quote taken at July 31, 2018

This implies we are short on 200+ rep users (20 people). This can be influenced by voting! There are so many questions unaccepted and a few do not have an answer, so there is a lot of reputation points to be awarded.

Please vote, not only answers, but also on questions. Please do also downvote to keep the quality high, but leave a comment why you downvote, when this answer/question is then modified to address your concerns please revisit to review your vote again.

Our site is dealing with electronics and practical engineering, so we use formulas in questions and answers on occasion, most usually when we have to figure out electronic ratings. 

When we talk about the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/760/analytic-equations-to-make-algorithm-of-3d-printerdesign or https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/631/how-are-delta-movements-calculatedfunction of printers more than "rule of thumb", we need complex math. When we estimate https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4472/how-is-the-print-time-of-an-object-to-be-printed-estimated?s=4%7C17.5425print times formulas could be used to illustrate the calculations. When we want to estimate the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6557/is-the-110m-length-accurate-for-3-0mm-1k-spoollength of a spool of filament, we need math. When we discuss https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/5155/8884movement paths, we also come into need for 3D geometry which can be simplified by using non-carthesian coordinates or functions - which in turn need manual typing of greek letters or proper formulas to be displayed well. 

Up to now I have been typing LaTeX formulas in online converters and copy paste the link to the image generated formula. This is quite labor intensive, especially since the SE does support built in MathJax.

A recent https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/6540/5740answer showed LaTeX/MathJax code in the answer, but that did not render into an actual formula image as it is not enabled.


  
  Supply voltage $ U_S = 12V \or 24V $
  Logic Voltage $ U_L = 5V $
  Sensor Voltage $ U_sens = U_L$
  Temperature control (Hotend/Bed/Cooling fans) $ U_T = U_S$
  


Why can't we enter formulas directly in posts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we get MathJax enabled?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems like a reasonable request and there are already a fair number of posts that would benefit. Two things to consider: 1) it will add extra page load time to each question (even those that don't use MathJax) and 2) the dollar sign is usually the right delimiter, but some topics need that symbol for other purposes. If y'all are willing to take the overhead and decide on a symbol, I'd be glad to turn MathJax on for y'all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JonEricson I put the discussion about the symbol up onto https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/341/which-character-to-use-to-activate-mathjax/342#342 - jsut so we can pin our vote down. `$` and `~` are only used occasionally and then as single characters, so both wouldn't create problems. On the other hand, we could rule out other standard characters as useful: §, %, &, * and # all have legitimate uses in either the 3D printing directly or in borderline cases (e.g. § when we need to talk copyright stuff, * to denote annotions at times, # for "generic number" or weights)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JonEricson - Hi Jon, and thanks in advance for sorting this out. `$` is the chosen symbol, in keeping with Robotics et al.. Looking forward to having it turned on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now that we have it enabled, thanks to Jon, you can accept ;)


















I understand 3D printing as a specialized topic of CNC. To extend the community other topics like mills, lathe or even punching turrets seem a good option to me because:


They all relate closely to the same techology: CNC control, axis, CAD modeling, G-Code, etc.
It would extend the possibilities of this SO page, which seem to struggle to get questions.


I would however not accept very different technologies: molding, vacum forming, welding, etc. :


Those are too different from the original 3D-Pringer topic.
I would orient the community toward hobbyist, ejecting the professional community, and this is something to avoid.


Speaking about renaming the SO, I would recommend something like:


3D Printing and CNC systems
3D Printing and Digital fabrication


This keep the identity of the community, but open the door to some other topics.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am for including CNC but against Vacuum forming, as in the first case the machinery is pretty much the same (even though it it substractive manufacturing) while in case of VF you use entirely different machinery (even though you can use 3D printed "molds" to create the actual item you want). Even a laser engraver is pretty much closer to a 3D printer than a VF machine.


















Well done for bringing this up. I was looking at those numbers too. 

Referring to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/264/what-does-it-take-to-get-out-of-beta-stage/265#265this post, almost all of the stats are improving (albeit) slowly, except for one, the ApQ 


  Are users put off by an expectation that a wrong answer might lose them rep?


It seems that way. Without wishing to provide a link to the actual comment, I noticed a comment the other day that suggested as much, and a nicely detailed comment was left instead. 

To be fair, I feel that way sometimes, and often hesitate (maybe rightly so to save myself from spamming the site) in posting questions on SE.Meta, as there are a number of drive-by downvoters there1. Unless you have a definite bug that you are able to document clearly or have a well rounded proposal that can be implemented easily, then your question may end up downvoted. This is probably rightly so, TBH, in most cases, but nevertheless it can be discouraging.

If you don't have much hard-earned rep then you may be less willing to risk it by posting a informative answer, that only answers half the question.  Is that a bad thing? Well, it is a double edged sword. It is a good thing, because that promotes good solid answers, but with the downside that you point out (a lack of multiple answers per question).

What can we do? Probably, not much other than creating a small community by promoting a friendly environment and communicating more clearly... Inviting people to chat in the chatroom, being more welcoming (with Hi and welcome), actually helping people without the old "Did you google this?" immediately.  All of these things help a lot. And which we seem to have developed of late. So we seem to be getting there.

I know that a number of members have already been adding answers to single answer questions as well as tackling the unanswered queue too. The more people that help the better...



1 Don't get me wrong, I looove (justified) downvotes, but I would like to know why.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You miss that posting a bad answer, getting 3 downvotes and deleting the answer will earn you a badge, at no overall cost - I think there is scope for educating people a bit better about the mechanics of the site, as well as talking about 'downvote because', 'downvote removed after edits' which I've seen in other places.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SeanHoulihane - good point. If a question is so poor that it has been closed and no number of edits will bring it up positive then any negative answers *should be* **self** deleted for the [Peer Pressure badge](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/38/peer-pressure). After all, the question will get auto-deleted (anyway, see SE.Meta - [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/78048/enable-automatic-deletion-of-old-unanswered-zero-score-questions-after-a-year/92006#92006)) as there are no upvotes on answer nor question, and the opportunity to earn the  badge is lost.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also agree with the 'downvote removed after edits' but it is hard to keep track of these as there isn't a notification mechanism to show that there has been an edit made to a post that you downvoted. Therefore it is necessary to constantly recheck manually, which is a right pain...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline That is exactly what is needed: a system that notifies you if an answer or question is changed after you downvoted. Manual re-checking is indeed a pain and many times simply forgotten...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar -  I read (a few years ago) a proposal for notifications of edits, on SE.Meta, but it was denied. I've just had a look and there are [*lot*](https://www.google.co.th/search?q=Stack+exchange+notification+of+edit) of similar questions, but this one seems to fit the bill (but wasn't the one I read): [Allow an edit to notify downvoters: “I think I've fixed the issue now - please check”](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1751/allow-an-edit-to-notify-downvoters-i-think-ive-fixed-the-issue-now-please-c?noredirect=1&lq=1)


















It seems, that there are roughly four categories of questions here:


Questions that are too broad for which we have expertise. Example: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6661/10684How to build the cheapest but safest laser engraver. For these questions, we generally know how to respond properly, but the questions are so ill-defined, that the whole thread becomes a mess.
Questions that are too broad for which we do not have expertise. Example: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6640/10684Am I allowed to publish a 3d scan of a [Buddha] statue?. These questions are formulated properly, but we lack the expertise, and so everybody chimes in with "half knowledge".
Questions that are narrowly defined. Example: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6342/10684What voltage does the Creality Ender-3 run at?. These questions can be solved with one answer.
Questions that are well-defined, but have multiple solutions. Example: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/4459/10684Noise Reduction. These are some sort of "medium size" questions, neither too broad so as to invite opinions, but not too narrow so they can be completed with one answer.


I think, to raise both the quality and the quantity of threads here, we should reduce questions of type 1 and 2, and promote questions of type 3 and 4.

In my opinion, posters of type 1 questions should be politely asked to narrow down their questions or, if not possible, marked as off-topic, closed, too broad or whatever designation exists. Type 2 questions should be moved to another Stack Exchange site.

As for answers per questions: Clearly, type 4 questions are the ones, that will raise the answers-questions-ratio (without sacrificing quality). But: Type 1 questions, if properly narrowed, can easily become type 4 questions and, therefore, help in raising the answers-questions-ratio.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Totally agree on all these points, and well put... except type 2 should just be closed as well and *once* they are closed then the OP is requested to ask their question on another site, which could be suggested (or we let them find their own home). TBH, while migrating questions is certainly possible, (and I was a great advocate of migrating, *until* I became a moderator), it is usually much easier for the misplaced question to be closed and the OP ask elsewhere, rather than mods getting in touch with other SE site's mods and requesting migration, as such requests are often refused anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think potentially 1 should be closed, and 2 is ok - but that is a wider debate.


















I bump this and propose the radical method:

We only need ONE https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filamentfilament tag and then any tags for specific material (e.g.https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plapla https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/absabs https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/petgpetg https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pvapva https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tputpu https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pcpc) groups that have specific properties (e.g. https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/flexible-filamentflexible-filament https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/conductive-filamentconductive-filament)


The difference between https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/thermoplastic-filamentthermoplastic-filament and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plastic-filamentplastic-filament in use is nonexistant and both are pretty much identical to filament in the current use - it is rather random which one gets used, in many cases more than one is used.
There is no filament that can be used in 3D printing that is not a thermoplastic, as the method to re-shape the filament via heat demands a thermoplastic.
While there are clearly more plastics than thermoplastics, non thermoplastic plastics are not useable for 3D printing unless you would design a whole printer to use for example an UV-curing resin delivered to the workpiece via a needle - which makes this a non-FDM printer.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it is worth stating what makes this best - and I think in terms of categorising questions 'filament' is more than enough for the current level of detail that these questions seem likely to cover.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SeanHoulihane added moreb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looking at the [synonyms](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags/synonyms) page, thermoplastic-filament is a synonym of plastic-filament. Are you saying that they should be merged?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@greenonline pretty much


















I see a number of people writing "CURA", when I have always called it "Cura". So I started to wonder if CURA was a capitalised acronym, like LiDAR or NATO (but not like radar or laser).

I had a look and the Wikipedia entry, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura_(software)Cura (software) doesn't appear to suggest that.

So I wondered if it was a marketing thing.



After all, over on SE.Arduino, lots of people write "Arduino UNO" - I myself did so to, for a long time, until Nick Gammon https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13839/can-i-use-analogreadresolution-on-an-uno-or-leonardo#comment25114_13839picked me up on it:


  https://i.stack.imgur.com/6piXl.png


I think that the reason that I did was that the Arduino pages write it in that way (arguably incorrectly) and it just seems to be a branding/marketing ploy.

So, is this the same sort of thing with CURA? I am just wondering where it started and came from?1



1 As one does on a boring rainy Sunday morning :-)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which is it - CURA or Cura?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think this is an acronym, but be aware that acronyms are spelled differently in Britain and in USA.  For example, "Nato" and "NATO", or 'Aids" and "AIDS".


















Yesterday, I was reading 3dprinting.meta and read a suggestion that (which I rephrase as) we should ask questions for the purpose of bringing answers inside our tent.

I spent some time thinking about questions I have been asked by friends who purchased FDM machines and were starting to undertake their own designs.  In particular, among the engineers I hang with there is a desire for the generally-accepted-as-valid design principles -- the design rules that, when followed, will usually work.  I haven't come across a reference that lays out such rules for FDM printing, and so I launched a question which someone who knew of such a rule set could answer, or which I could later attempt to answer if a better answer didn't appear.

I asked https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6726/primer-on-3d-printing-design-rulesthis question.

The question drew a "have you googled that?" response, coupled with a helpful link.  Other comments ensued, along with two down-votes on the question.

My question here is in two parts:
Is this an appropriate activity -- to ask a question hoping to receive a better answer that I would write myself, and
If the motivation for the question is appropriate, how should the question have been better formed?

I realize that two downvotes isn't all that important, but it is important to me to understand and act in concert with the community culture. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What community guidelines have I messed when I asked the linked question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really feel guilty now. Half asleep I closed your question by accident, and there is nothing that I can do to retract that vote (I have checked with the mod chatroom and on meta). The only solution, seems to be, that which Sean suggests, and edit it to ask what the design rules are (do it within 5 days whilst "on hold" and vote to re-open it), rather than ask for a link. As a mod, if I vote to close or re-open, then that vote is decisive. I have lost the ability to vote as a normally user, unfortunately, so I can't help with the re-open vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Once again, I do apologise for my poor eyesight and clumsy fingers :-(.


















TL;DR The answer that this question was looking for can be covered in 4 or 5 basic points, without much ambiguity. The question is therefore not fundamentally too broad, but could maybe be made a bit more specific.

Too broad seems a bit of a mis-assessment, but I think it's maybe a mistake to ask where to find this information, since that does read a little bit like "find me a link". I think a better question would be to ask what are the basic design rules - and then worry if that is too broad.

We need to focus as a community on taking questions which don't quite fit, and improving them, otherwise we will not get people coming back with more questions and later helping others. There is still a focus amongst some members on only answering specific 'problem' questions, rather than generating a comprehensive resource covering the whole subject. SE intends to be the top search result (and presumably the answer and un-informed student was looking for).

Maybe 'design rules" seems to broad, when you presumably care about the factors that are unique to FDM. (i.e. exclude all the general engineering principles which would be common to subtractive machining, injection moulding, etc. even though they are obviously still relevant). I feel this was kind of implicit in the question, but some may have been mislead by the terminology.

Should tolerances be included? With an electronics background rather than engineering, Design Rules implies a final sign-off stage check of low level trivial detail rather than the entry point to the design flow.

I think the question also suffers slightly from a I have an answer in mind, so it seems that I'm asking the question in a way that leads to that answer, kind of an X-Y of getting the answer posted (in this case, the answer is the true goal, not the question).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I specified FDM because those are the first machines most friends have bought.  The phrase "design rules" may be tho much a term of engineering art.  Most engineering fields have some rules which are easy to state and provide good guidance for design.   There is an art to crafting the rules,  and expressing the rules in a simple and memorable way.  I could attempt to write them,  but thought someone may have already have done so.   The link provided with the answer is helpful for defining the terms,  and is a good reference.  This is a good community.   Thank you all for you time and insight.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Design rules` in an ASIC or PCB context implies more of the low level minimum feature size, track-track separation, etc. rather than the basic principles of engagement with the technology.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cmm - Are you going to re-word the question - or do you want someone else to? It is a good question, and as I stated before, I would be interested in the answers. It has moved from the on-hold status to closed, so if you edit it now, it won't automatically go into the re-open queue. Edit it, flag it for moderation attention and I'll re-open it, and we can then see how it fares.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenline  I guess I didn't understand that editing a question was either an option, or a suggested path.  I was at a wedding yesterday, so I didn't see your note in time to respond.  Thank you for not letting go.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cmm, sorry, didn't see you'd been pinged here, I might have waited for your response. I think we need to be generally trying harder to edit questions which get flagged. We did this on IoT and it was quite productive.


















One thing that I noticed about the stats for this site when I first came across it was how high the number of registered users and visits is, compared with the number of active users and questions.

For some time, I felt the site had either picked up some bad stats, or was in the final stages of fading away. I think things are a little more normal now though.

It seems that we still have a bit of a problem with becoming sticky for lots of users. We're at 151 200 rep users (out of 10k), and https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/94224/internet-of-thingsIoT is at 149 out of 7k, so it seems maybe we're not too far apart. The big difference seems to be the number of views. 1.2k per day on IoT, and 2.8k here (maybe expected since views depend on visibility of the site spreading over time).

Are people really coming here and finding answers to their questions? Are they coming here and asking a single question? Are we on the wrong end of cheap printers with poor support, holding back the really interesting questions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Talking about my own case, I know that I'm not really looking for answers here as I have an Ultimaker and they have a very active community on their forums. They got a handful of very active people on there, mostly users but also a few employees, who reply to most question in the same day or so, and the forums is a trove of answer. Plus the fact that they have forums in languages other than english means that not many people who own an ultimaker or use cura will look elsewhere for answers to their questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Are we on the wrong end of cheap printers with poor support` ... Lately we are bombarded with questions on the Enders... poor printer quality on poor support leads them to this site I guess.


















We have two tags: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport & https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-structuressupport-structures 

These two are essentially the same thing. Even the abbreviated tag-wikis are pretty much saying the same thing. IMHO, we should combine the two tags as they are superfluous. 

There was the Meta question: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/168/11242support-material / support-structures Tag unification? which was about combining https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-materialsupport-material & https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-structuressupport-structures which was turned down, but this request is quite different.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag synonym: support & support-structuresb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we have to remove the "support" tag (support can have a different meaning), support-structures is more descriptive.


















I've made a synonym - apparently it needs https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags/support-structures/synonymssome votes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a problem with "voting" on the synonyms. You have to have enough tag votes in both to make the vote. I thought it made the synonym automagically for mods? Also, I would have thought it should be the other way, with [tag:support] being the main tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(a) Yeah, I was surprised when it didn't just make it and required votes (maybe I am not all powerful after all?) for approval. (b) I thought `support-structures` should be the main as it matches `support-material` in format, and it is a more descriptive name (i.e.,  as `hbp` is the synonym of `heated-bed`) it seems to make more sense to do it that way around... I dunno, it can be swapped if you want.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, go to the synonym page and look at the list to the very right where it shows the vote count in parens. You should see an "approve" link there (I hope). That's what I just saw on two different synonyms on Mechanics.SE and was able to approve them outright.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, well spotted :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Really, it should have just created it for you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I might bug report that on SE.Meta


















Whilst looking at the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags/synonymslist of synonyms I see that https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machanicsmachanics is a synonym of https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mechanicsmechanics.

Is machanics a thing, or a typo? If the latter then surely that tag should be deleted, as we shouldn't attempt to accommodate typos (common or otherwise) with synonyms.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What are machanics?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks to me like it was a typo.


















There was a previous question suggesting that the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-materialssupport-materials tags should be merged, and at the time the only response was https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/168/11242to keep them distinct. 2 years later, I think it is time to disagree.

I've already found https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5318questions which talk about support material in the abstract sense, of how to slice, rather than the intended use of the tag to identify the specific material used for support. This automatically makes the tags too imprecise to retain.

We should retain the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport tag, and merge the other two into it, since that covers the whole group of questions cleanly. I don't think we need synonyms, unless the other tags get re-added by users in the future.

I don't think the aim of tags is to generate a complete literal taxonomy of the subject, rather we are trying to define:


What subjects are on topic (support certainty is)
How to most usefully group questions.


Now, support (the structure) and the types of material are literally different things,but together they encompasses the topic of support. There is nothing wrong about referring to the specialist filaments as support. It is also misleading to assume that the structure can be discussed in isolation from the potential materials which can be used.

Along the lines of avoiding the highly complex https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/61/4927suggested heirarchical filament taxonomy, I think we can best help people to find questions about support by consolidating the questions under a single tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Support materials and structuresb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it was between `support-materials` and `support-structures`. The tag `support` appeared to be superfluous (or an umbrella) and I've "synonymised" it to `support-structures`... although now I am wondering if that was correct, as some of the `support` questions may have been about material and not structures. `Health` and `Medical` is another confusing pair that I came across a month ago.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline, made my proposal more specific, to keep just the root category.


















3 tags is probably overly complex. I've not looked at the question list but I expect that these questions should also have a print quality or electronics tag, making the categorisation of the question fairly clear. The problem to me of having several tags is choosing which one would be relevant to a question, and also having to literally look through all the individual tags if you were looking for a question that matches a certain type of issue.

Looking at the questions so far, the vast majority are discussing the part cooling fans, or the distinction between part cooling and extruder/heatbreak cooling. I don't see any questions about specifically cooling the circuit board as was indicated in the tag wiki for https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/print-fanprint-fan.

Given the potential confusion about what a fan is for, and the lack of a need so far to identify questions about PSU cooling, a single https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fansfans tag still makes sense.

Tags can be combined as https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fansfans https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/print-qualityprint-quality, or https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fansfans https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-supplypower-supply, but tags can't rely on being combined to make sense.

I like your idea of having a single fan tag and a second tag to specify the fan, problem is that people need to add the extra tag, or the community needs to pay attention that a second descriptive tag is added.


















Both tbm0115 and Sean make very good arguments and I am really on the fence on this one... So, I am withdrawing my solution for the moment, as I am not sure that I agree with the amalgamation of the two tags. However, if they are to be amalgamated then I would propose that this would be the way to do it...



You might not like this temporary solution, as you state that synonyms aren't needed...

I can make https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-structuressupport-structures and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-materialssupport-materials synonyms of https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport, for the moment (so swapping the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-structuresupport-structure and its synonym https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport that I did yesterday and add https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-materialssupport-materials as a synonym of https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport).

Then later they can be merged into https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport, once any issues (or non-issues) have been raised or pointed out - or if there are any serious objections later on down the line, the synonyms can be easily removed and reverted (whereas a merge can't be).

Does that sound like a acceptable plan?

I think according to the [tag:burnination] FAQ then re-tagging of these questions is the right thing to do, and like this we can see if there are any valid cases for the specific tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That link shows an empty list - is that right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I only wanted a [ tag ] label, not a link...

I did find several tagged incorrectly as support-material which are actually talking about the physical support (material), rather than the material of the support.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, does the fact that there is a synonym thereby prevent the retagging? That's annoying, if that is the case. Maybe I should remove the synonym until all retagging has been done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The the synonym is used, the master tag gets applied.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, i've removed the synonym


















As seen in this https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/324meta question, the OP, who is not exactly an inexperienced SE user, didn't realise that editing of questions to improve them was

either an option, or a suggested path


Yet the whole basis behind making all posts on SE https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/109786/cc by-sa 3.0 is to make it easy and clear that posts will be https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/120576edited to improve the content of the site. 

We might have a problem here with https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111closing or locking too many questions, discussed early on in the history of this site. It is easy for users to pile in on top of a downvote or close vote, and to justify this as keeping the site content of high quality. For sure, we don't want to be a repository of badly written 'fix my printer' posts.

On the IoT site (also in Beta, and with a fairly small core of engaged users), we made a deliberate effort to https://iot.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/190improve questions which were initially closed, once the OP had been given some time to make their own edits. This was quite an interesting challenge, since it helps in thinking what the really useful question to have asked would be. Overall, it improves the number of questions (and thus the reach of the site when it comes to organic search). It keeps the active users engaged in proposing edits, it generates more answers to be upvoted. If the OP comes back to ask another question in 6 months time (after their mini rage-quit), they might be pleasantly surprised to have gained some upvotes or answers.

Clearly not all bad questions are good candidates for improvement. Anything that has some technique/skill aspects (not just troubleshooting) is worth trying to rescue. First with specific directive comments, then with an edit. Where the problem is more along the lines of language or punctuation, I tend to edit by example (and re-structuring a question is also easier to explain with an edit - just encourage the use of rollback).

A critical detail from this https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/113/4927answer, when a user is inexperienced with the technology, they will not know the terminology and they will not understand how to ask about their underlying problem rather than what they think they need to do to fix it. We can help this with some signpost or 'duplicate target' types of question.

I'm not proposing a free for all on off topic or poor questions, just that our resident experts try and see if they can write good questions on presented topics.

Remember, do not answer a bad question unless you want to make sure that even after being closed, the question won't be deleted.

https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/flexibleflexible could be used together with the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filamentfilament to indicate the question is about flexible filament, but I understand that it may be beneficial to have separate TPE/TPU tags (it saves a tag). Furthermore, there are also tags for https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plapla, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/absabs, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pompom etc.


TPE = ThermoPlastic Elastomer
TPU = ThermoPlastic PolyUrethane, which is a type of thermoplastic elastomer


I suggest to make 2 tags https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tpetpe and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tputpu where the TPU tag is a synonym for tag TPE.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1: I like that concept.

The reason I ask is, if TPU is a subset, but different from TPE, why not keep them separate. To me there should be no issue in doing so. People should not be confused by that if they are familiar with either filament, especially if the wiki is filled out for each. JMHO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 from what I've read is that it exactly the same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it ***exactly*** the same?


















From https://rigid.ink/blogs/news/172062855-what-is-the-difference-between-tpe-and-tpu-flexible-filamentWhat is the difference between TPE and TPU Flexible Filament?

TPE = ThermoPlastic Elastomer
TPU = Thermoplastic PolyUrethane, which is a type of ThermoPlastic Elastomer

which is as 0scar has already stated, i.e. TPU ∈ TPE. It goes on to say:

Although technically classed under the ThermoPlastic Elastomer
spectrum, the full name for TPU is ThermoPlastic Polyurethane. This
isn’t especially new in industry, but until recently wasn’t commonly
available in 3D printing.
However recently it’s growing a lot more popularity among printers.
While on the surface very similar to TPE, but TPU 3D printing has some
notable differences.
TPU is very similar in elasticity and other mechanical properties to
TPE. Although it is very slightly more rigid, at Shore 94A-95A. This
makes it a little easier to print in printers that don’t usually print
the original, softer TPE 3D printing filament well, as the slight more
rigidity is easier for the extruder mechanism to handle.

So they don't seem exactly the same. I dunno, I'm not sure. However, we apparently have the tags already, so that isn't a major issue anymore.
With regards to the synonym aspect: Are the questions going to to be the same, i.e. will the same issues happen to both TPU and TPE, or will TPU have special, particular issues? If the latter, then a synonym maybe isn't a good idea.
Regarding https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/flexibleflexible, I wonder if it is necessary. Aren't we trying to reduce the number of filament tags? See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/fixing-the-filament-tagsFixing the filament tags. If having https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/flexibleflexible will help in this direction then all well and good, otherwise, maybe it isn't.
However, I'm not a filament expert. You can decide what you want to do and if you need me to do it, message me in chat or leave a comment.

Please look into /questions/147/hobbyist-machine-questions-on-topicthis question, which is a similar question as you ask. 

I think the general consensus is that CNC and laser cutting machines fall in the same category as 3D printers with respect to control, axis, modeling, etc. as the difference may be the tool the positioning head is carrying. 

My general concern is if you want to include this, does the name of the site cover the content? "Makers.SE" is suggested, but that would include even more "hobbyist machines" that at least fall very much out of this scope (like the mentioned vacuum forming).

When we keep the name 3DPrinting, it should be about 3D printing, if the scope is extended (which is perfectly defendable for CNC machines and laser cutters based on similarity), the name should be changed (if that is possible). 

I'm not in favor to change the name as it might scare people away or may cause people to not find the site. At the moment we are already doing everything we can to get out of the Beta phase.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't like the idea of a name change, at least for the main title. There has been reason given for changing the URL, as in so we can have posts show up in the chat, but that doesn't imply a site definition change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How about 3D Automated Manufacturing, which covers additive and subtractive?


















These settings should be known from the inscription on the box or found on the internet (where you ordered the filament, or from the vendor's website) for that specific brand and type, I do not see why this should be maintained here. I strongly agree with https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/146/5740Tom van der Zanden's answer that if people have problems, while following the ranges described by the vendor are used, do not lead to acceptable prints. 

To quote Tom, 


  I have X printer, using Y settings, printing Z model in material W and
  I have V problem - how do I improve my settings?


are valid questions,

and


  What is the best profile for printing material X with printer Y?


or (without the printer type)


  What is the best profile for printing material X?


are not, and should indeed be voted to close due to "Unclear what you're asking?".

You might wonder why the model makes such a difference. The difference is that instead of maintaining a database with settings for all material brands and or types, you now have a specific problem for a specific application that could be answered rather than having endless discussions over how people print a filament at which settings. It is the model that is sliced where the settings act upon, frequently this is where people make mistakes. Also, successfully extruding filament in the "air" does not guarantee success in printing, the difference is stressing or pressurising the filament path, hence a model should be included.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there that much of a difference based on the model being printed? I've not seen any real difference based on model, but only depending on settings and filament being used.


















Asking for which type of extruder is used by this assembly is on-topic, where to buy (shopping) is off-topic. This is discussed in https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topic/295#295this question.

https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/293/on-topic-purchasing-acquisition-question-typesAnother question that points out the differences between "shopping questions" is still unanswered but discusses differences between shopping questions. Some can still be answered based on how they are formulated.

Generally, "where to buy stuff" should be left to the OP, he can Google that himself, but what it is called/named or how does it look like or if there are printable or alternate version available are IMHO on-topic.

For example, the [thermistor question](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6849/ultimaker-original-temperature-sensor-replacement/6851#6851).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline Maybe we should ask those to join in [chat] and pass that information there. Adding an image to show what they look for or describe what they look for might be an idea, but my general opinion is to not answer those questions with direct links. In the past I referred to "Those typical auction sites or Chinese vendor sites", or something in that line. I guess most people will understand where to get it then...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, good points. I think that adding an image is harmless, but if new people see links in my answers, I guess then they might feel encouraged to ask a question hoping that someone will answer and provide a sneaky link - point taken, I hadn't given it much thought, tbh. I suppose that it never pays to be *overly* helpful. :-)

Tags I'd like to see for such a question are: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filamentfilament and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pausepause. The question is about pausing the machine (in which he changes the filament).

In terms of searching there may be a need for a tag https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/change-filamentchange-filament, or at least a tag https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/changechange or maybe better like @Greenonline suggests: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/swapswap or https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/changeoverchangeover?

Actually pause could be good, as it might have other uses... why else would one want to pause a print, other than to change filament..? To change temperature? To pause overnight to avoid house fires and/or noise? These are what google just threw at me...


















Text would probably be best because it is searchable, so things can be found faster then by just looking at the long list of settings available in any slicer/printer/device available with your own eyes.

However, as far as I'm aware, exporting settings in text format from a slicer/printer is still wishful thinking due to many factors.

I remember a long conversation on the Ultimaker forums a few months ago about this very proposal: being able to export settings in some form, to make it easier for people who are experimenting to follow the various iterations of settings more easily.

Some people asked for text format, csv, odt, etc, but the people of Ultimaker ultimately crushed the hopes of everyone by explaining, in technical terms that I did not completely understood, that it wasn't possible without rebuilding the whole thing from scratch.

Thus why we're stuck with screenshots for the foreseeable future.

Questions and answers are usually not that long to spot certain text when you are on a page, what does it add if it is searchable for the site?

If it is in the question body it means it is searchable.

Linking to websites is OK as long as you also post a summary.

I'd assume that to mean "Stack Overflow", but obviously it's our question we're talking about here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes I mean stack overflow question. Which is probably redundant.


















Two questions that are not related should not be grouped together in a "single question" format. Maybe it is not forbidden, but certainly not a logical thing to do.

We should encourage people not to post multiple questions as


this makes it more difficult to answer as there are multiple answers, and
we also need more questions.


Furthermore, it is probably also easier to find (when they are separated), either through the site search or through Google.

In the specific case you mention, the common denominator is the use of Ultimaker Cura, but a print bed size question and a question on support should not be together in a "single question". Furthermore, his second question is pretty unclear, it is not specified what the actual problems with the red areas are, there is no mentioning of a failed print. Discussion in comments has been avoided to clear that up.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah I am all for encouraging them to do better. Though as an Admin and I have flags for a post like this, there's not much I think I should do. I do not think we want to close questions such as this. Though I could see doing that for a more extreme case. This one second question was a minor topic. But if the post was I have this issue with an extruder and this Cad question, then we likely should close.


















Hands up, guilty as charged. In my defence sometimes using the answer as given raises even more questions. In mitigation, from the knowledge gained (from helpful folk or simply own stupidity), I now contribute to others starting out. Will try harder.

P.S. Is there anywhere in the forum with a cure for life interrupting printing? Wife, dog, children, grandchildren all eat into my learning time....sigh.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well... we are not a forum... but the best cure for RL bugging into printing is dedicating time to it... and locking yourself with your printer for that time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I added more screens in my life. Kitchen, bathroom, and car now have a screen on which I can watch educational content while I'm cooking, sitting on toilet, or stuck in traffic. Podcasts while exercising, etc... I try to maximize the value of what I watch and remove the mindless entertainment that teaches me nothing and/or gives no inspiration, such as- sports on which I have no money vested, any show involving "judges" or "reality", and anything on the "History" channel.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A fellow amateur radio operator of mine mentioned that he works out while he makes contacts (his radio shack is in the garage with his work out equipment) and he'll make a couple of contacts in between reps and ultimately "work out" for 3-4 hours.


















I've been active on SO since it was in beta, and have participated in numerous SE sites when they were in beta.

It's my impression that there is much more enthusiasm for close votes here than in other sites which launched out of beta.  I know that seems to discourage me from participating more, and may discourage others likewise.

Whereas for programming and electronics my first goto is always stack, I'm finding that other sites are having better answers and a "nicer" approach to my n00bism in 3d printing.

Just IMHO and FWIW!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Part of the problem is the questions though: we get a lot of questions that do forget to tell us the essentials: their printer, their print material, their print settings and yet show us only their fail. If I show you a broken bolt and ask you "Where does this belong?" I can at best tell you that it is a broken bolt and maybe its sizing, but not where it belongs - Look around your house and you will find a couple dozen m3 bolts. How am I supposed to know where the broken one is missing?! The extra info I usually ask for is to dial in the problems from everything to a handfull.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Trish, that's reasonable.  Just based on my own experience though, I think I've gotten as much closure grief here as I've had in all the other sites combined, so I've sort of migrated my interest over to reddit-land and facebook groups.  I hope things turn around though, since this could be a great resource.


















Copied from chat



I agree about the posting of the entire configuration file or G-code in a question is too big to fit, etc. What is really needed, and I've thought this for a long time, is a SE sanctioned version of PasteBin [functionality]. A persistent scrapbook/scratchpad site internal to SE (like the i.stack.imgur.com site) where over-sized chunks of code/configs/text can be pasted, without it being an external link (which carry the inherent risk of link death). That would be the correct solution, and I don't understand why that hasn't been set up. Seems odd to me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That sounds like a great solution, hope the SE developers pick that up.


















I have the feeling that a lot of the questions with non-accepted answers are users that came in for one or two questions and then left for good without ever accepting an answer. They might even have forgotten about this place.

For the note: we have (according to https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/lookup/3dprinting.stackexchange.comArea 51) 11,291 users that have joined (probably including spammers). Of these only 168 have gained 200 or more Rep, which is a quota of 1.488%. So only about 1.5% of the userbase has shown more than a glancing activity. 200 points equivalent to 40 votes on questions or 20 on answers, so it is a point showing at least some dedication to the stack.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unless the users come from another stack, they could start with 101, then all your math halves. :)


















It's New Year's Day in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_TimeStack Exchange land...
A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
-- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation

While there certainly are https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/Moderators here, a significant amount of the moderation is done by ordinary people, using the privileges
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.
As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together.
To that end, here is how the moderation done here on 3D Printing breaks down by activity over the past 12 months:

Below are the review queues for ELU, ELL, and 3DP:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/08pBy.png https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yOo4.png https://i.stack.imgur.com/BG0xj.png

Is there some reason that the order here is not the same across sites?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is our moderation queue order different from the other sites I have access to?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5honestly? No idea... Bug?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Based on my testing on SO, Android.SE, and Anime.SE... the cause of the difference is that ELU, ELL (SO, Android.SE and the rest) have their own site-design, and 3DP (Anime.SE, along with many other sites) are still using common (aka. "beta") site design. But still, the underlying question is valid: why is the order different? ._.?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Davo, it might be a good idea to mark Glorfindel's answer as the accepted one... :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oops, thank you.


















Yes I do think we need such a tag (https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hominghoming), homing is a specific action that should be identified as such. I've added the tag to a specific question on homing and will go through the questions to re-tag other questions. Also, the tag https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/x-axisx-axis is also very beneficiary. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I too am in agreement on adding both the homing tag and x-axis tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good move. There is no "Usage Guidance" for the tag though, it might be a good idea to add some...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline done!


















I pondered this question a while ago and tried to come up with a coherent and minimalistic strategy. This would be my suggestion, as to what is on-topic or off-topic:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/tCcAG.png

So, basically, on-topic would follow the formula:

(formingMethod == additive OR substractive) AND (instrument == machine)

Off-topic would have the formula:

(formingMethod == transformative) OR (scale == mass) OR (instrument == human)

This is just my suggestion and I invite everyone to put forward their argument, if they think, that a better strategy or community can be created, if the boundaries are to be moved or the criteria re-defined.

Vacuum forming on an individual/batch scale, for example, would be a topic, that is close to the other "green fields". If we want vacuum forming to be on-topic, we would have to give up the "transformative" criteria. I'm sure, there are other points like this.

I also assume, such a strategy would have to be adapted in the future, when these methods have either matured, have been adopted by the masses, or other methods have been discovered.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5CNC and Laser Cutter are currently not considered on-topic in most circumstances. The ones where it is on-topic deal with dual-purpose or converting. It is pretty much "additive Manufacturing".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Only just seen this... I  like the matrix very much, nice presentation, better than my unwieldy list. I'll need a day to two to digest this and I'll come back with some comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about 3D printer options for welding, EDM, injection molding, or vacuum forming? I ask because we have all of these in prototype phase where I work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Welding can be considered IMHO as "additive", friction welding is more "transformative"


















Sounds like a great idea.  StackOverflow is by for the most populated site (and the one I came from).

3D printing interests nerdy-trendy folks like those the in SO, that's where I can from.

Prehaps woodworking SE sites would work as well.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can try this. However, when you advertise something which really is unrelated, the reality of it getting sponsored (getting six votes) becomes pretty slim.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Woodworking would have a large crossover.  Engineering too and maybe boardgame people.


















Considering 3D printing needs 3D models, I think it would be natural to advertise on https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2580/13218Blender.SE, perhaps with a catchphrase like "Want to print your Blender model?"

https://graphicdesign.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3573/30985GraphicDesign.SE also has questions about 3D design (not necessarily 3D model), and the scope on 3D-related questions is debatable. Regardless of that, I think there's nothing to lose trying to advertise there?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is definitely doable and is absolutely related in both cases. We'd need some ideas as to what we can do as far as the images behind the ads. I like the idea of the Blender quote ... I think it's a starting point and something we can work with.


















How about https://engineering.stackexchange.com/Engineering.SE? 3D printers are pieces of engineering ingenuity, we sometimes receive questions that should be asked at the Engineering stack, I could imagine that there is a need for the other way around where people are interested in materializing their engineering question or solution.

As I'm seriously lacking graphical design skills; I cannot really contribute to the actual design, but what may be interesting is to have a printed gear/sprocket morph into an actual gear/sprocket with the text "How about materialize your idea" or something with similar context.

This could be something to start from:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/cgn85.jpg
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Makes some sense! What are you thinking for the ad itself? Any ideas?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 Updated the answer to include an idea for the banner.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the same vein, Electronics.SE is pretty much out sister side when it comes to wiring.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - Anyway to fit something like that into a 600x500 pixel image? The ad could read something like: *Imagine. Design. Slice.* along the top, then *3DPrinting.SE* along the bottom.


















I think we all had this issue in the last years:
As we learn and grow our own knowledge, things we once considered hard become easy.
Now, our answers often address issues that are pretty easy to fix by tweaking simple things like...

leveling the bed
fixing the settings in the slicer
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/7591replacing a broken endstop for a new part
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/8064correct replacement nozzle
pretty 2/3rd of the questions in https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/troubleshootingtroubleshooting

At other times, we clearly go into advanced repairs and fixes, for example:

https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/6660/8884flashing firmware
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6399small alterations of the firmware
https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6358installing new capabilities to a printer
most of the remaining 1/3rd of https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/troubleshootingtroubleshooting, usually for the points above

And then there are at times rather complicated things, for example:

https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/7662sifting through the firmware to find when one function is actually called
the remaining https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/troubleshootingtroubleshooting turns out the be this, because of the oddity of the problem.

Let us make a rough guideline what rough level of expertise we expect from a common user and how to address the required level of details in answers!

It appears that the manufacturer of my 3D Printer may have gone belly up.  Can I ask about that in the 3D Printing site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it OK to ask about companies that make 3D printers or related products?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This might be a good time to discuss this further, and I think this should be broken into finer topics about what can be asked about the company itself. Generally, questions related to company's policies are deemed off-topic on SE because it's something that we can't answer officially as consumers.


















This could be valuable information for others too, certainly if it is hard to find that the have gone bankrupt. Usually, in the beginning of bankruptcy, it is not clear whether the company can be saved or not. Most of the times they are unresponsive to emails/contact.

On the other hand it is a little off-topic from what we as a community have https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicdefined. See also https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topicthis meta question.

IMHO we could allow questions about 3D Printer manufacturers.

I don't want to ask off-topic and opinion questions here, but I would like to find a cadre of others dialing in their devices.

For example: https://www.facebook.com/groups/prusacommunity/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5HI, I migrated the question to meta, I hope that you understand why. :-) BTW, What do you mean by `dialing in their devices` exactly? Do you mean comparing their printers and posting pix? Or something else? @Starwind has a (large?) Facebook group, he might know more...? I don't have a Facebook account (left it years ago) so I don't know anything about that...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I thought I had written it on meta.  I wonder what I did wrong?   It is totally not a main group question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@greenline I'm not sure what word is used in the Prusa community.  I mean going through the process of tweaking this and that to improve the reliability. There is data in support of the mmu2 being a great addition, but at the moment I have a user interaction rate of about 5-7%.  With 100 changes, I have to intervene on about 6 of them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mick Thanks for the reference to the Facebook group.

As a little trick: one can add these templates "invisibly" by adding the text between <!-- and --> and turning it into a supposed HTML statement, which then is invisible on the real view but can be edited and easily modified in edit view.
Add the following comment to highlight this:

Hello [User]. Your question is lacking detail and as such is hard to answer without knowing a couple of things about your printer setup. Please [edit] and fill in the [placeholders] in the template I added and then remove the leading <!-- and trailing --> afterwards.

The most basic problem when we have to help is, that we often don't know what the setup is. So, we need stuff to help in identifying what the user is actually using. But how does the user know? They could fill out the blanks in this, as these are pretty much readable from the slicer and machine:

I have a [insert printer make and model] which I use together with [insert slicer here]. I print in [PLA/ABS/PETG/Whatever Material] at [Extruder temperature] °C. [The print bed is set to [Bed Temperature] °C / I don't have a heated print bed]. I use a print cooling fan at [whatever] %. The layer height I set to 0.[x] mm, the line width [line width/extrusion width] from the 0.[x] mm nozzle. The Printing Speed is set to [x] mm/s [for walls and [x] mm/s for infill]. My retraction is [X] mm/off at [x] mm/s.

A very useful template indeed - it will save a lot of typing, as do the [standardised comments](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303/do-we-have-standardised-comments) Thank you :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've just realised that *when* these are used, for a *new user*, we might have to tell them to remove the `` once they have filed in the blanks - or end up having to remove them ourselves...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline yes, one would.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have changed the language within the template to remove the word "terse". Terse has negative connotations in the English language. It generally means "short and rude". If you say an OP's question is "terse", you are basically calling them rude ... In the process, if we really don't mean that, we are the ones being rude.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 - good point, well spotted... it'll also need to be removed from the standard comments too, as I think I used it there too...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline - AH!

Or would that make it too complicated?


















Copyright is a delicate subject. SE has a strict policy regarding copy pasting other people's text. Correctly citing parts or rephrasing in your own words mitigates this.

What is SE policy for questions containing screenshots of pirated software? What should we do? It must be clear that such practices shouldn't be allowed or endorsed at 3DPrinting.SE.

We don't have many problems with that here admittedly, but I thought that I would share this with you all.

From SuperUser - https://meta.superuser.com/questions/13646/editing-of-recently-closed-questionsEditing of recently closed questions:


  This post is basically to share something I came across on Meta Unix &
  Linux. Kusalananda♦, a moderator there, posted https://unix.meta.stackexchange.com/q/5319/85417Editing questions
  recently put on hold (don't). The gist is something that I don't
  think is common knowledge, and it would be beneficial to apply the
  same logic here.
  
  It is common knowledge that editing an on-hold post automatically
  bumps it into the Reopen review queue. But there are two factors that
  may not be common knowledge:
  
  
  That only happens within the first five days of closure.
  It only happens once.
  
  
  There are a number of implications.
  
  
  The five day limitation means that you can time your minor edits on closed posts so they don't unnecessarily force wasteful
  reviews. If you want to do tag cleanup or make minor English or
  formatting fixes that don't address the closure issue, wait until
  after the five days.
  If you edit and fix the closure issue on a question closed more than five days, you need to also vote to reopen to get it into the
  queue.
  The bumping happening only once was the impetus for Kusalananda♦'s post. If you edit the recently closed post to do minor polish that
  doesn't solve the closure issue, that bumps it to the Reopen review
  queue where it will waste a bunch of reviewers' time and won't result
  in it being reopened. But that also uses up the one automatic
  bump.
  
  Then, when the OP or another user actually fixes the post, that
  will not bump it into the review queue. Unless someone explicitly
  jump-starts the review process by voting to reopen the question (which
  typically isn't a requirement), the post will remain closed and
  potentially be deleted, even though it's been turned into an
  acceptable question.
  If you are going to fix a recently closed question, make sure you fix every issue. Questions often have multiple problems and just one may be stated as the close reason. Review the question to identify
  everything that is a potential close reason, and address them all.
  Otherwise, you might fix only one of the problems and the question
  will not be reopened due to the remaining problems. That puts it right
  back at point #3.
  
  
  Bottom line: if a question is recently closed, do not edit it until after the five days unless the edit will solve all closure
  issues.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Editing of recently closed questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know for sure, but doesn't the OP have the opportunity to VTR their own post after they believe they've fixed something? Parts of what you pasted here doesn't make logical sense to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure, it's been a while since I've tried to reopen a closed post. I had a view closed recently on Electronics.SE but I think that the on-hold period has finished now... so I can't check.


















I found this question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/10010/laser-is-engraving-the-negative-spacelaser is engraving the negative space in the close queue this morning as being off topic.  I was about to respond, and through I'd look at the community view on meta.  I found this question and answer: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67/fdm-printer-that-can-also-mill-and-engrave-whats-in-scope/68#68FDM printer that can also mill and engrave -- what's in scope?, and this META discussion https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/349/is-it-possible-to-expand-the-scope-of-this-siteIs it possible to expand the scope of this site? which suggests that it would be on topic.

What should I do with the question?  As a relatively low-reputation participant, I want to defer to the greater experience.

Many of the problems of 3D printing and laser etching are similar, but not all.  The equipment is much like FDM 3D printers, with some differences.  How finely should we diagnose the nature of the problem before deciding if it is on topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is laser etching, specifically a question linked below, considered to be on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for pointing out the `FDM printer that can also mill and engrave -- what's in scope?` question - I hadn't seen that before, and I will add it to the long list of questions on the [Game plan - What is on-topic?](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topic) page. I had seen the laser graving question, and was unsure why it was off-topic, given the expanded proposed on-topic list.  TBH, that list needs to be put into the On-topic help page, and set in stone, IMHO. I'd be interested in seeing the answers that you get to this question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There was also a scanner question a few months ago that got closed too, and I thought scanners were also fair game now: [Resources on getting horus/ciclop scanners to work?](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/8057/resources-on-getting-horus-ciclop-scanners-to-work), but I digress, and will bring that up in a different meta post - but thanks again for reminding me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5WRT how far should we go, looking at that laser question, it *seems* to be a g-code related issue - given that it has a g-code tag (rightly or wrongly), and therefore *maybe* on topic. As you say, as the common mechanics of laser engraving and 3D printing are, mostly, quite similar, then if the question is related to steppers, control, power, etc. then maybe it would be answerable. However, if it starts to ask about the finer points of engraving, then is there actually anyone here, or who comes here, who can answer that? If there isn't, then there's probably no point in asking it here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another [question](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/10055/laser-la03-5000-wiring-to-ramps-1-4) appeared after the one you linked. I think we should allow these questions, basically it is a 3D printer that uses a different tool. The only thing is, that voting is lagging behind because people have no affinity with the subject.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5RE: "However, if it starts to ask about the finer points of engraving, then is there actually anyone here, or who comes here, who can answer that? If there isn't, then there's probably no point in asking it here." - **perhaps if we have the questions, we'll attract the expertise.**

I like the expanded definitions, but there is probably an issue with some of the things you'd put into "just rough around the edges" portion of what you state.

For instance, "Print Services" are mentioned as far as on-topic and what is allowed. To what extent are Print Services on-topic and allowed? In and of itself, as you've stated it, it could be anything from what to expect to giving them service recommendations (ie: What's a good place to get xxxx done? or Who provides to best services in the Dallas, TX area?) This isn't the only place where it could be done. If you don't want questions like this, throw a little more specification in there as far as what would be acceptable. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, thanks Paul. I realised within about an hour of posting it, that I may have opened up a can of worms, with the open ended-ness of some the topics listed - with the recent fastest MDF printer question being a good illustration of this issue. I may have been a little premature with the update and not thought the whole thing through fully. I might pull it briefly, while I rethink and clarify. Thanks for pointing it out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline - I don't think I'd pull it back ... let's just get it cleaned up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5regarding the print services, many questions can be locked as "Opinion based" asking for best or good place.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Trish - While that is true, if you state up front it's not allowed, it will preclude them getting asked in the first place ... not all of them, but from a moderator's perspective, it's a lot better to catch a large percentage of them before they become questions than it is to rely on running them through the review queues. Human intervention is tiresome to say the least.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Trish and Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 many thanks for the input. After some thought, I have added a bit more to the topics page. See my answer below.


















I have updated the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicon-topic page which some further explanations that came to mind, as well as some hopefully not to wishy-washy small print. The points below have been spliced into the on-topic page in (hopefully) the appropriate places.

If anyone has any other suggestions of further expansions to the explanations of the new on-topic topics that they feel are left a little too open ended and would like to see spliced in, then please add them below (to either this wiki answer or post their own answer) and I'll edit them in.




Recommendation-based questions really are off-topic, unless very specific indeed - and even then they may still end up being closed.
We want to try to answer as many questions as possible, but they do need to be answerable, and not require opinion based answers - some questions will only be able to attract opinion based questions, so again, don't be surprised if they get closed...
Print services questions, should not be asking for recommended service suppliers, but rather is it reasonable to ask such and such of a print service, or what do they usually provide, or is this a reasonable request to be made of a print service - again, these may only be able attract opinion based answers so again these questions are likely to be closed.
One thing to bear in mind is that a lot of questions can only be answered by opinions, but those opinions are usually based in, and backed up by, fact and empirical results. A question asked that requires supposition and thought-experiment type answers are generally purely opinion, and not really (and can not be) backed up by hard facts.
Legal issues may be asked, but as we are not lawyers then I Am Not A Lawyer (IANAL) should always apply. Generic legal questions can also be asked on https://law.stackexchange.comSE.Law.
Given the fluid nature of this nascent beta site, the following list of topics has been added, after evaluating demand from the community. Some topics such as CNC, and Laser engraving, whilst are not 3D Printing, they share a lot of commonality. Where such questions are regarding such commonality then they may be considered to be on-topic. As always, all topics are subject to community discretion.

This list will eventually be integrated into the Common Topics section above.

This is a tricky one, as 3d printers are starting to be bundled with lasers. Note those kits will totally blind you. 3d printers are being bundled with everything, really if you look at the things http://diabasepe.com/http://diabasepe.com/ is making. (Cool guys btw)

However. To me this is the same as asking about a woodburning kit question in an electronics forum, because they both use soldering irons. If we allow a removal base machines, such as lasers, we will also have to allow discussions about CNC machines.

In the case of that question, they would get bonus points if it was a pure gcode question. Maybe even if it was on a multi use machine.. Instead its asking us to debug their laser setup. Thats not really formatted for stackoverflow anyways. They need to go to a forum. Also as someone that once made a Cheap Chinese laser cutter use a RAMPS 1.4 board, I know exactly how similar they are. But in the end, additive manufacturing isn't this kind of laser (as we have SLA and powder printing)

At first I was this is dead simple not on topic. Thinking about laser and 3d printing is a good counter arguments, but that is not what this topic is. It is not additive manufacturing, and its not being done to a part which was additively made. 

I think its a firm off topic. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have customers who use a 450nm laser to photoinitiate crosslinking in their print media. That is 100% additive manufacturing with a laser, without being a sintering process. Food for thought.


















Photogrammetry (3D models from photos/videos) and 3D scanning (like structured light and ToF) are popular ways of obtaining a 3D model for printing.

Is the discussion of those techniques on-topic here?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is photogrammetry and 3D scanning on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53D scanning should be on topic, it depends upon the question, I guess. See [on-topic](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).

So which one is that? Is that different from original, or 2, or 2+. Maybe it deserves it's own tag? Strangely, it is not listed in the [Wikipedia products section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimaker#Products), although google comes up with valid product pages, even on the [Ultimaker site](https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/manuals/ultimaker-3d-printers/ultimaker-original-plus).

Printer manufacturer: Creality

In the light of FlashForge and Ultimaker, shouldn't the manufacturer be included (prefixed) in the tag?

We'd need a question that has at least 2 printers targeted to tag creality or one about the company.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Trish I cannot follow you, all 4 tags for printer models exist and could be prefixed with [tag:creality-...], I'm not in favor of adding the tag [tag:creality] unless there are questions for it.

It would start to make the tags twice the length. On the other hand, having the makers name in the tag would avoid [this issue](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/439/canonicalizing-verbosifying-software-names), i.e. it ("Creality") would not need to be repeated in the question text itself.


















Every time I write "Cura" in a question or answer, it gets edited to "Ultimaker Cura", https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/10940/11157most recently resulting in awkward verbose repetition that required additional edits to fix. I don't see any justification for requiring use of official verbose names for software products that can be clearly identified by a well-known shorter name. For example on computing SE sites we don't force users to write "Microsoft Windows" or "Redhat Linux" in contexts where "Windows" or "Redhat" would be understood. And even on this site I don't recall every mention of "Ender 3" getting edited into "Creality Ender 3".

Is such a policy (it's effectively a policy, since it's enforced by edits made by a moderator) appropriate for this site?

For what it's worth, as a new-ish contributor to this SE site, having nitpicky edits to all of my posts does not make me feel welcome and appreciated.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Canonicalizing/verbosifying software names?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can see what you mean, but I am sure that any such edits are meant with good intention, and are not intended to annoy anyone or make them feel unwelcome.  We like to try to keep this particular SE site correct (be that grammatically, SI units and the correct spacing, or brand names or what have you). However, you raise a valid point, w.r.t. the manufacturer, and we'll take note in future. Cheers :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, I don't think the intention is bad. But it ends up being irritating and with a result that's objectively neither better nor worse, just gratutitously difference from what the author originally wrote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All good points and quite understandable... BTW, thanks for your input and contributions to the site - the more active members the better, and we might actually make it out of beta (one day)..! :-D


















Thanks for the input (+1) very much appreciated! First of all it is never the intention to annoy or irritate people, my apologies if it is experienced as such! Small edits are sometimes necessary to get out some spelling and unit spacing errors to improve the layout and readability of the questions and answers. I think the edits to the software name are born from my own experiences and nuisance as an owner of a software product that is misspelled many, many times, even by my own management... You've definitely got a point when it is seen as a nuisance and should therefore not be done anymore. 

Do note that the software initially was called Cura and the name was changed by the developers to explicitly include the company name at some point (version 2.something), hence the changes. I guess it would be best to use the complete name when one refers to the installment version, but can be shortened when referred to in text.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally I don't like the units changes either - replacing space with ` ` is ugly and makes the markdown hard to read/edit, contrary to the whole purpose of markdown, and I don't even consider a space between the last digit and °C to be proper style - I always learned the degree sign goes immediately "on" the digit. But these are all matters of formatting style where it's easy for me to accept that the site mods want a polished uniformity, even if it's not one I agree with, much like a common indentation style in a codebase.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@R. - Please read [Don't forget the space!](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/297/dont-forget-the-space). It is the [international standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#General_rules). The ° is adjacent to the quantity *only* for angular measurements... that surprised me too. You *could* use the unicode non-breaking space character (`U+00A0`/`\xa0`/`ALT255`), but as that is invisible, it's virtually impossible to tell if it is there or not. BTW, if you have anything that you wish to discuss, you can join us in [chat].b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline: Fair enough. This probably has some relation to my being one of the folks who refuses to say kibibytes. ;-)

Are questions about applications of printed outputs on-topic?

Some examples that I suspect will involve both on-topic and off-topic specimens:


Can model X be 3D printed using common materials and machines in a way that is strong enough to hold up Y?
What is the largest known example of a Lego model made entirely from 3D-printed bricks?
I saw this item out in public <shows picture>. Was it 3D printed?
Can one of those 3D printed phone cases really protect my phone?

Good point and I would point you to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/21/are-questions-that-tangentially-involve-3d-printing-on-topic/23#23Robert's answer. 

We've just expanded the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicon-topic page, with areas that were initially vague and unclear as to whether they were on topic or not, and which, over time, became clear that they should be on-topic. The initial proposal of the expansion was illustrated here, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topic?rq=1Game plan, and the final update was posted here, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finallyOn-topic has been updated - finally!.

So, if your questions are on that (new, expanded) list then yes, they are on-topic. Otherwise, if they get posted they may get close votes, but then again people might find the question useful and run with it. It's up to the community really.

Sorry, if this answer is a bit vague and I can't be more specific (at the moment).

However, IMHO, I think that the site is intended to be more about the mechanics of 3D printing and getting something printed, rather than what you can do with 3D printed objects, as the latter is a extremely broad area, unbounded even. But others may have a more broader, and more accommodating, view. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, I'm super-cool with deliberate vague-ness in this area. I've been a [public proponent](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/26614/3043) of the "community/audience fit" approach to closing off-topic posts for (checks timestamp on the linked post) almost exactly 10 years now. Generally I would recommend new or beta sites SE sites such as this define their topic area _extremely broadly_ while still building their audience, and then only firm that up after volume increases.


















About Friday, this question was transferred to 3D Printing Beta: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/11371/which-nema-17-stepper-motor-for-titanWhich NEMA 17 Stepper Motor for Titan?.  I left work for the day without clicking send on my comment, or my answer, and found today that it had closed, locked, and rejected. A comment said it should be rejected for being a hardware recommendation question.  Ultimately it was closed for being off topic.

IMO, both of these reasons are incorrect, and miss the point of the question.

Yes, the OP admitted that they were facing their conundrum because of a long delay from China, but the question was not about vendor A vs. vendor B.  The question was about what the requirements are for a motor in a particular application.  This was about specifications and parts selection, not, in the sense of I think it was intended, a product selection.

The OP wasn't asking about one 3D printer vs. another, or one system manufacturer vs. another.  The OP was asking which of two motors would be more suitable to the application.  This is engineering, not marketing.  This is education, not shilling a vendor.

As for being "off-topic", are we rejecting all questions about components and 3D printer engineering problems?  Have we become strictly a user group for off-the-shelf printing systems?

I feel strongly that this should be the place for discussing 3D printing engineering, and use, and tools.  But, perhaps this interest is unique to me, and I should find somewhere else to interact with 3D printing users who have engineering problems.

Have others noticed that the volume of reddit traffic related to 3D printing has dramatically increased in the last few months.  Has reddit become the preferred place for engineering questions?  

As for the user who had the 3D Printing Beta door slammed in their face, IMO both options they presented were sub-optimal, and by closing the question we can't help them either with the choice, or with understanding why.  

It is a shame when a curious OP with a question that is real to them is rejected.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was this (stepper motor selection) question deemed "off topic"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have an answer that you wish to post? It could be reopened if you wish to do so. After all, it *was* closed prematurely, with only four votes.


















IIWY, I would just edit the question (using the edit link beneath your post, and leave a comment (mentioning the update) for the person who answered (i.e. Tom), by addressing them, using their username and preceding it with the @ symbol (or, easier still, just leave a comment under their answer).

Tom will then be able to update his answer, so that both question and answer remain in-sync.

There is an edit history anyway (again, accessible via the edited link beneath the post), if that is your concern, so all changes can be tracked and viewed (and rolled back to, if need be) at a later date.

However, Tom appears to have picked up your error already, and left you a comment.

Repair vs. Maintenance

Status: TBD

We have both a https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/repairrepair and a https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/maintenancemaintenance tag with 10 and 25 Questions respectively. Repair is described as:


  Use this tag to indicate the actions or activities to undertake to fix an item or a process.


while Maintenance is


  Questions about general maintenance and upkeep of printers.


I would like to redraw the distinguishing line, which is rather blurry:


Maintenance can be replacing worn parts, which also could be seen as repair if it brings a machine back to specs.
some maintenance tagged questions are also https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/troubleshootingtroubleshooting, which means they could equally well be tagged repair
other maintenance tagged questions are tagged with https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/replacement-partsreplacement-parts, which would imply a repair of the first type happening as part of routine maintenance (and could arguable count as a repair)


As those tags are rather similar, we need to find a solution:


Redraw the line and distinguish better, maybe recategorize parts.


maybe https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/model-repairmodel-repair vs. https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printer-maintenanceprinter-maintenance?

Merge the tags into one or the other (maintenance is more inclusive), alias one to the other?
Keep as it is?
Other?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would disagree with a merge, mainly because while they can related, they are still distinctly different. I mean, on Mech we differentiate between the two even in the title of our Stack. I do agree there can be a gray area between the two where they can overlap. Personally, I think if something falls into the gray realm, maybe both tags should be used. Just thinking out loud, though.


















We don't get a lot of traffic here on 3D Printing (Beta).  I check every day, and often don't find questions to respond to -- and I am prone to over-responding.

Is the intention of SE that questioners (within one particular activity they undertake) will tend to ask questions on one site, or do we expect sites to have very narrow, non-overlapping scopes and place the onus on questioners to determine the correct site?

In other words, if I cross-country ski and also 3D Print, clearly questions about each activity should go to different sites.  But, within cross-country skiing, would questions about waxing be directed to a materials science site, questions about packing the snow be directed to a landscaping site?  Or, would they all fit within cross-country skiing?

I know this isn't a clear answer.  To the extent that I may take a position, I would encourage someone who has found this site to stick here until they clearly can be better served elsewhere.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is quite a lot of traffic actually if you look at the site statistics (unlocked at 10k reputation; compared to other SE sites), what you actually mean that there isn't much user interaction, most is redirected from a search, register (or not) and get their information and leave. Maybe if we would vote more, reputation grows faster and people might stick. Sadly there are too less voters at this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - Actually, traffic can be realized on [the main page of all the sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic).  3dP is getting 3.6k visits/day (at the moment). Mech is getting 50k right now, though that's actually pretty low. It's usually well in the 70-80k range. Remember too, during this time of year, sites usually lose traffic until right after Christmas, then it will spike up again. At least that's how I think it happens! :o)


















As the question states, should https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bedbed and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/build-platebuild-plate be merged? Basically, both tags refer to the same part of the printer; https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bedbed should be a synonym for https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/build-platebuild-plate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we merge tag "bed" and "build-plate"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For discussions: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/103247/should-we-merge-tag-bed-and-build-plate


















Edit: I like Trish's suggestion best.

I vote no. Our (Hyrel) printers have, on some models, a thick aluminum https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bedbed that can reach 200C, but we expect users to mount different https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/build-platebuild-plates on it, depending on what material they're printing with. These can be coated with PEI, garolite, polycarbonate, or others; or they can be commercial build plates like GeckoTek or Anycubic Ultrabase.

You heat the bed. You print on the build plate. In some cases, these may be a single item.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough, but I think all of the current bed-tag questions fall in the build-plate category, so bed tags could be removed and questions retagged untill we get a Hyrell bed question. What I mean to say is that currently all bed questions are tagged incorrectly. I will go through them to find out. Thanks for the feedback!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note for a heated bed there is a separate tag!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm. Well, I suppose there's no need for an unheated beds tag... We actually have a chilled (sub-zero) bed as well, but no need to go making a bunch of tags just to satisfy ontological OCD. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5:-) That was exactly my point, the bed can be merged to build-plate. Then you still have the option to not add the heated-bed tag, then it does not have to be heated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5or we separate better: Bed for the mechanical side, heated-bed for the heating, build-plate for adhesion or surface things?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Davo see https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/103247/should-we-merge-tag-bed-and-build-plateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tris thanks, I've added some info there.

For example, whenever we talk about a "glass bed" we actually mean a glass https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/build-platebuild-plate that is mounted on a heated bed. Springsteel usually is correctly referred to as build surface. BuildTak and other build-surfaces are bonding directly to the bed. The distinction is pretty much along these lines:


The mechanical moving system is under the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bedbed


the heating effect of this makes it a https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heated-bedheated-bed

The area directly in contact with the extruded plastic is the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/build-surfacebuild-surface
The plate in contact with the curing resin in an SLA printer would be the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/build-surfacebuild-surface


Technically, there might be a renaming needed closely related:

I find `bed` to be difficult to use correctly, certainly for newcomers, `platform` or `bed-structure`, `heated-bed-plate`, `glass-print-surface`, `PEI-print-surface`, etc. are more logical. So if the `bed` questions are re-tagged correctly, we won't have a `bed` tag left!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That... actually seems like a good solution. @Davo what do you think? Kill `bed` and `build-plate` completely in a rebranding and sort the questions into `bed-movement`/`bed-structure` and `bed-heating`/`heated-bed` and `build-surface`/`glass-build-surface`/`removeable-build-surface`?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5see also: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/103247/should-we-merge-tag-bed-and-build-plateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've posted in the chat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This sounds great.


















I'm the creator of the https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/123448/drones-and-model-aircraft?referrer=ZmE4YWM1ZWU2ZjY5MWQwMWRmOTA1OTc2ZjkxZjAxM2ZlODdhOGJlNGVjYjFhZjAwZTFjNWEyYjBhYjk2NDY4OLDMyKDmFz1uUizHMJ7iBT-Kq7o5vD1yZrURKVuvgOW50"Drones and Model Aircraft" SE site proposal. Aside from reaching the requirement for >100 committers with >200 reputation, we are doing very well.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/NAw4p.png

Since our communities have a lot in common with all of the 3D printing I know takes place in the model aircraft and drone flying hobbies, I'm hoping to be able to convince some 3DPrinting.Meta users to commit to our proposal.

As I mention in https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/q/29987/165459this Area51.Meta post:


  The problem arises from the fact that since this community is fairly different in scope and intended audience in comparison to most other existing SE sites, we have only been able to recruit a little less than half of the required supporters with >200 reputation across the Stack Exchange platform.

Area51 is unfortunately understaffed at this time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Basically, your question could be seen as an advertisement. So instead of focus on getting enough people to backup your proposal, you could go a little more in detail how *3DPrinting* and *Drones and Model Aircraft* are not overlapping. This still gets your attraction while discussing overlap. E.g. design of servo mounts could be posted at your site, while printing issues with supports or filament specific questions fit better here.


















to make reading tags easier, I propose to swap https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lcdscreenlcdscreen to https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lcd-screenlcd-screen, in line with https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/x-axisx-axis and others.

There's been a bit in the news about persons 3d printing parts to help in the COVID19 pandemic, but as mentioned in https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahgoehrke/2020/03/29/fda-oversight-emerges-for-additive-manufacturing-resources-in-pandemic-response/this Forbes article,


  Community response is high, but also in short supply is often the knowledge of exactly what will help, and how and where to deploy that help. 3-D printing random designs found online might feel helpful, but if those designs don’t meet usage criteria or aren’t produced in satisfactory environments, ultimately it’s often just a waste of plastic. 


So are questions related to which parts I should print to be most helpful be on topic? Or questions about where I can find guidance on the best support?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about how I can help in the COVID19 crisis on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5-1, only because I think that we aren't equipped to answer COVID requirement questions. A medical SE site might be better (if one exists). I'd plus one the "ultimately it’s often just a waste of plastic" quote though. People printing random ventilator parts at home in non-clean environments, using random plastics, doesn't help in the slightest (unless it is for prototyping).


















Several questions are related to first layer calibration or issues: I found 43 of them with "first layer" in the title alone, 150 with "first layer" anywhere (no duplicates).

I propose adding a "first-layer" tag to more easily retrieve said questions.

I already applied it to my latest question without thinking about it, but I can remove it if desired.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New tag: first-layerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it is closely related to build plate adhesion, but a first layer tag might be a good idea. Need to think it over.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there some problem that the first layer can have that others can't - other than bed adhesion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A problem I see is that many issues (like bed not level, or zero position off) are usually noticed on the first layer, but they're overall setup problems, not first layer problems.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Davo when the question is asked, it's not yet know which is the cause. But I see that the tag is not so needed as I thought.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FarO I'm not against the tag, I'm just trying to understand the category of problems for which this would be better than some other tag (like [tag:adhesion] or [tag:bed-leveling]. If such cases exist, then I'm all for this new tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar if Trish cannot, can you delete the tag I created? I have no rights for that.


















Remember that you aren't the only one voting on questions and answers, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=allmore people do, actually, voting is the way to show your appreciation.

It can happen that if you upvote, somebody else might have done that too since you loaded the page. So after voting, the counter would have increased by 2 as if you did that, but in fact it is just more people voting while your page hasn't been refreshed yet. The system won't allow you to vote multiple times.

Please https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-voteremember to vote often! That is much appreciated!

That was the problem I was getting to.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonathan - Probably just some weird browser bug. It happens from time to time (unrefreshed pages etc.)


















The tags https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport & https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-structuressupport-structures are in fact referring to exactly the same thing!

Furthermore, the meaning of support can be interpreted differently (i.e. helping out).

I support renaming/merging the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport labelled questions to https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-structuressupport-structures. This implies that the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport tag is removed and it could be reinstated at any time by new questions. Users with enough reputation can remove the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport tag if it gets recreated and we could create a synonym later. 

In my humble opinion, the best solution may be to rename https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport to https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportssupports and then make it a synonym for https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-structuressupport-structures!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, you should have "support" point to "support-structures", if that is your intent? If you just rename one to the other without pointing it, the old tag can be recreated. As a mod, you can create the synonym directly without the voting hassle (it's hard to find five non-mod votes to push the synonym forward as they have to have "so many" points within the tag to vote on the synonym ... it's ridiculous).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did not think of it being re-created... We can anyways remove the `support` tag if it gets recreated or create a synonym later. I'm more in favor of renaming `support` to `supports` and then make it a synonym for `support-structures`. (I was thinking of a mod forced change, no voting)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yah, "supports" would work as well. I'm just thinking of removing the confusion up front. A little more work now creates a lot less work later, kind of thing. The thing I don't like about "support" as meaning someone coming on here to receive support ... isn't that what they come on here for help with in the first place? It seems like a superfluous kind of tag ... sort of "self fulfilling" or something, I don't know. It's like a tag named "help" ... lol.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sometimes surprised by the stuff the new users pull, but I'm always patient, and wouldn't be surprised to see the help or support tag appear... So we rename support to supports and create a synonym, the support structure will be the main tag.


















I think the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/adhesionadhesion tag should be used instead.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you delete the tag "first-layer"? I have no rights for that. The question which had that tag were in fact all about bed leveling or adhesion, I edited them (but in fact they already had the correct tags).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FarO not a single one with [tag:first-layer] exists. The tag will die itself in a couple days.


















I struggled with the same question since I saw the edit, good that you brought this to Meta! Thanks!
As the community of regular and active members is limited, I think it is okay to welcome people in a comment or an answer. It would be a shame to scare people away after their first question, resulting in abandoned questions and unaccepted answers. But, we do need to conform to the Q&A format and sometimes need to remind people this isn't a forum of threaded messages and we do have some rules to participate. We have created some /q/303/standard comments that welcome and thank new members but at the same time lead them to the rules of the site.
It might be a good idea to approach first time (SE) members friendly. Welcoming comments can and tend to be deleted after a while when users aren't new anymore (everybody can raise a flag on a comment to vote for ”It's no longer needed"). So option 4 would be my preferred option.
Personally I think this site is more welcoming than larger sites as SO for instance. My first experiences at SO didn't make me feel welcome.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar, thanks for your reply.  I feel aligned with you here.  Welcoming is fine, perhaps even good, but expect to either edit one's own answer or have it edited later.  I'm OK with that approach.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cmm I've been thinking a little more on this subject and think we can welcome people even better by appreciating their questions and content by voting on their contributions. Please consider voting more often! If the question is not up to par, edit the question or guide the user and then upvote! The sooner they reach 50 the sooner they can leave comments and enter the public chat.


















Following up from some comments1 left on https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/14195/4762this question, here is a brief list (quick braindump) of common things to keep an eye out for, when making an edit to tidy up a post:
Obvious mistakes

Typos
Spelling:

commonly used 3d -> https://www.lexico.com/definition/3d3D;
proper capitalizing:

printer/electronics make and model like:

ramps -> RAMPS,
ender -> Ender,
bltouch -> BLTouch, etc.;


software products like:

cura -> Cura,
octoprint -> OctoPrint,
pronterface -> Pronterface


Others:

gcode -> G-code;






Grammar.

Salutations

Removal of signatures;
Removal of greetings, such as "Hi"/"Hi there";
Removal of 'Hope this helps' - "Stack Overflow is like an encyclopedia, so we prefer to omit these types of phrases. It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful." - I saw this quote on SO.
Removal of "Thanks" - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for "Hope this helps", then the same can be applied to "Thanks" - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also "Thanks" reduces the encyclopedia "look" of SE.

Correct use of SI units

SI units are the standard (Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units);
Adding non-breaking space before SI units (&nbsp;) - see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/297/4762Don't forget the space!;
Temperature units:

Celsius: c or C or oC -> °C (&deg;C)
Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -> °F (&deg;F)


Electrical units:

Voltage: v -> V;
Current: a -> A;
Resistance: Ohms -> Ω (&Omega;)



Presentation

Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;
Replace slang, or text-speak, with grammatical English;
Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP.
Remove instances of "EDIT:" and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.

Text formatting

Removing HTML tags (i.e. <br>) when there is a markdown equivalent;
List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;
Quotes must be blockquote formatted and have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.
Code formatting: G-codes should be code formatted, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (```).

Images

Image descriptions, and image hover tags;
Clickable image display - i.e. [![<imagedescription>][x]][x], sometimes, somehow, the "outside" wrapper brackets get lost;
Orientation of image - requires a bit of "manual" labour in an image editor;
Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of "manual" labour in an image editor;
Ensure that the image has been added to the Stack Exchange imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rotlink-rot.

Inlining links

Inlining links with the title of the linked page;
Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.

Title

Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itself;
Title case should be replaced by regular case, i.e. "This Is Very Ugly To Deal With";
Remove any information, already present in the tags, which is repeated in the title. For example, if the title is "Filament - Is PETG more weather resistant than PLA?", the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filamentfilament tag can be used instead, and the redundant "Filament" can be removed from the title2.

Information from comments

Often there is a large amount of additional information in the comments beneath a post, in response to requests from other users. This additional information really should be in the post itself.  The comment should be copy/pasted into the post and tidied, if necessary.
Once the edit has been approved, the comment should then be flagged as "It's no longer needed"


There are probably more examples, so this list may get updated from time to time.

Footnotes
1 I wrote this post as one central post doesn't seem to exist. There is a series of disparate meta posts (either on this meta, or other meta sites, or the main https://meta.stackexchange.comSE.Meta site), each dealing with one of the different facets of post editing, listed above, which I'll get around to posting links to. However, generally, it is by looking at other people's edits (across the various SE sites), that one gets an idea as to what should be fixed.
2 Of course the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/petgpetg and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plapla tags can also be used, but you wouldn't want to also remove them from the title as it would become meaningless..!

Currently, pure CAD questions are out of scope of our Stack, but we have quite some cases that edge, where the question about the CAD is about how to make a model printable or design principles or such.
Where do we draw the line in the sand? https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/204/the-fine-line-between-3d-and-cadThis was once discussed in 2016, but no conclusive answer defined.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5CAD Questions - Reviewb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The [On-topic page](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) has now been updated for clarity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any **signpost page** here on SE, which could help navigate to valid subdomain? There is a search page aggregating questions, but no tags summarized :(. It could be done using brackets, but still the result is questions, not **the community**. I could find "freecad", "cad" or "technical-drawing" on stackoverflow, engineering, graphicdesign. **Global tag search** could help navigating a lot - and would be much more constructive for redirecting someone. *Btw. there is also "3d-printing" on engeneering site (after quick look I would say most of questions fit there better, but not all).*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@octopus8 there is no meta-tag-search. the tag for us in other SEs is in the nature of the beast: 3D-Printing has overlap with other areas. Blender, Engineering, [Arts & Crafts](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/449/avoiding-overlap-with-the-arts-crafts-site), a little bit into Electronics.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course, I see the same and I agree with overlapping. I puzzle how to pin "where should I go with this" to the process? One idea is to have manually maintained signpost page in help center, but this would be just a workaround. See: being newcomer having a urgent issue, the chance to land at "on-topic" page is minimal. Plus all small widgets always make the site little overwhelming. I discover something every day. My suggestion: could "on-topic" link be added to "Step 1: Draft your question" when asking?


















My stance on the topic is:

Any CAD question should show how or why they are related to 3D printing, otherwise it is out of scope.

Examples: "How to cut up a model for 3D printing" is in for showing relatedness
"How to do a plane Cut on a model in FreeCAD?" is out for not showing relatedness


Questions about functions of a program are out of scope unless they show how they are related to 3D printing.

Example: "How to combine two bodies in Fusion360" is out unless showing how it relates to printing
The same question showing relatedness: "I want to print a mashup model of this and this STEP file. I need them as a single STL. How to do that in Fusion 360?"


Bug reports are always out of scope. We are not the bugtracker.

There probably should be a dedicated Stack for CAD, but it could well be that there are good alternatives for that, as a CAD Stack would have to cope with all the different software applications out there.


















It is good that you found that original question. It was added to the https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topicWhat's on topic meta question, but that area of the topic list doesn't seem to have been particularly well hammered out. If you look at the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat's on topic help page, it does state:

Blender - whilst there may be some overlap with https://blender.stackexchange.com/SE.Blender, if the question is related to 3D printing then it is on-topic

Maybe the whole line needs re-wording to be less Blender centric..?
Regarding the question that caused this issue to be raised again, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/15335/how-to-combine-difference-with-concatinate-objectHow to combine difference with concatinate object, I must admit that initially I agreed with https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/15335/how-to-combine-difference-with-concatinate-object#comment28882_15335Mick's comment that it was probably on-topic. However, following https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/15335/how-to-combine-difference-with-concatinate-object#comment28885_15335your comment, I wholeheartedly agree that any CAD question really should have some 3D printing element attached, in order for it to fit on this site (as the On-topic help page implies).
So, in short, you are indeed correct, and backed up by the what's on-topic help page.
In addition, the on-topic help page needs a slight clarification, such as:

If a CAD question is related to 3D printing then it is on-topic. However, general CAD questions, if there is not a 3D printing angle, are not on-topic. Likewise, with Blender - whilst there may be some overlap with https://blender.stackexchange.com/SE.Blender, if the question is related to to 3D printing then it is on-topic.

In the https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-roomchat this had popped up:

https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/56705982#56705982Are questions related to DEFCAD's Liberator permitted here?

After https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/359688/389668asking on the main Meta, I was asked to ask here instead. How shall we deal with the topic of 3D printed guns?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53D printed weapons and usb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's in the on-topic page, I vaguely remember seeing it today. Says off-topic (I think). Actually it should probably be moved it to the off-topic section at the bottom.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline the "Legal issues" category lists "guns" as on topic,b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh does it? Oh dear... Hmmm, not sure then,b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline I read that as questions about the legality are on topic (I think they are). It is not a carte balance about *how to print a barrel* or somethingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, right. Yes, so a legal question is OK, but how to print is not? So that (partially) solves my question in the comment on your answer then.


















I think we should not allow asking about manufacturing 3D-printed fireams because it opens liability under NY law: The servers of SE are in NYC as is the company's incorporation. This means each user avails themselves to NY law under diversity jurisdiction - but the company is probably fine with https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-serviceToS #9... https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-gun-safety-legislation-ban-3d-printed-gunsNew York banned untraceable 3D printed weapons and knowingly aiding in the manufacture of untraceable guns. Any 3D printed gun could be made untraceable by omitting one step in the manufacture that does have no structural impact - the addition of metal. So as a result any knowing assistance could be seen as causing the manufacture of an untraceable gun under New York Penal Code section 265.50 (Caps original, Emphasis mine):

§ 265.50 CRIMINAL  MANUFACTURE,  SALE,  OR  TRANSPORT OF AN UNDETECTABLE
FIREARM.
A PERSON IS GUILTY OF CRIMINAL MANUFACTURE, SALE, OR TRANSPORT  OF  AN
UNDETECTABLE FIREARM WHEN HE OR SHE KNOWINGLY MANUFACTURES, CAUSES TO BE
MANUFACTURED,  SELLS,  EXCHANGES, GIVES, DISPOSES OF, TRANSPORTS, SHIPS,
OR POSSESSES WITH THE INTENT TO SELL:

ANY FIREARM, RIFLE, OR SHOTGUN THAT, AFTER REMOVAL OF GRIPS, STOCKS
AND MAGAZINES, IS UNDETECTABLE; OR

ANY MAJOR COMPONENT OF A FIREARM, RIFLE, OR SHOTGUN WHICH IS  UNDETECTABLE.


CRIMINAL MANUFACTURE, SALE, OR TRANSPORT OF AN UNDETECTABLE FIREARM IS

If you mean the company, then you should probably have kept the Meta.SE question. Some users will disagree with you, but that should be fine. You might not get a definitive answer from Stack Exchange Inc. or not find a policy about this as others have suggested there, but that should be fine too. If you meant something else, you should probably clarify.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ICloneable anyone who engages with such a question by answering. WE as in the community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, in that case, the fact that the servers are in NYC is not really relevant. The community members are not employees in the company and I would imagine that most of them are not residents in NYC.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ICloneable but interact with NY state in doing their "business", their actions of answering actions is happening (for the law) *in* NY.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be honest, I think the mods would delete, not just close, any firearms questions that come up. Similar to if someone posted on Arduino "How can I make a bomb"? :-) However, what about 3D printed crossbows, or a spear, or club? Umm, this is getting murky now... IANAL, so I have no idea what we are meant to do actually.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline Why does it have to imply criminality? A pyrotechnic might be developing a detonation device and might choose Arduino as their platform. It doesn't imply that it's criminal. In fact, printing 3D firearms is legal in the US (as long as you insert a special metal bar). There's a big difference between a legitimate question about legal firearm printing and a low-effort "how do I make a gun?" question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@forest the world is much larger than the US, and it is illegal in New York State.


















ERRORS

Connecting 3D printed parts - For example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6214/laser-engraver-with-smoothie-ramps-1-4-or-awc708cconnecting 3D printed parts is currently off-topic2
Coding - For example https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3109/how-to-build-own-cura-guiHow to build my own Cura GUI? - Coding Ultimaker Cura question, migrated to SO3

These two "footnotes" don't exist.
The first of the two does not seem to link to the question in the supposed title... in fact most links seem to go... off sideways to the actual proper link. Might there be a numbering issue?!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I thought I'd removed all the references (I did remove #1, didn't see the others). These footnotes are in [Game plan - What is on-topic?](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topic). As to the sideways links, maybe the numbers of the links are messed up - actually, yes, probably. I'll look into it in the morning. Cheers for pointing them out. Actually the links probably shouldn't *even* be in a on-topic page. They are leftover comments from the "Game Plan" meta page, when the list was first being constructed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, removed links and refs as well as a bit more tidying and expansion of examples. The trouble with providing examples, is that the list gets even longer. I think it is waaaay too long, IMHO.



















As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestiona tradition of sharing moderation stats for the past 12 months.
As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
-- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation

That doesn't eliminate the need for having https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/moderators altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.
So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpgexciting stats. Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on 3D Printing over the past 12 months:

Footnotes
¹ "Community" here refers both to https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/usersthe membership of 3D Printing without https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsdiamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/-1user #-1.
² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.
³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-userGenerally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.
⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.
⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes).
⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.
⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

I don't know if that would make the table unwieldy after 5 or 10 years though, unless it was made scrollable horizontally. It would just show progress (if any) a lot better, rather than one year in isolation, and then having to open the past year's results in another tab and then having to flick between the two (or more tabs - if more historical progress is to be seen). Does that make sense?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It makes sense, yeah, @Greenonline — I'll see if there's anything we can do about it for next year, but can't promise anything.

This https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6624/47620question now has two questions-posted-as-answers from new users. When this happens, we delete the answer but also leave a comment asking the new user to post their own question:

Hi and welcome to SE.3DP! Unfortunately, your answer does not answer the question. Without wishing to sound harsh, StackExchange is a Q&A site, and not a forum of threaded messages. The reason for this is to aid the search for answers to issues, and provide it in a structured Q&A way. I know that this might seem a pain, but can you repost your question using the Ask Question link at the top of the page? When you repost your new question, please feel free to refer back to this original question using the URL, seeing as it is the reason why you posted in the first place

However, they don't seem to ever re-post their query as a question.
So, my point is, should we:

Convert the answer into a comment so that someone can answer them (also via a comment);
Leave the answer as is (so that someone can answer them (also via a comment)), or;
Continue deleting and leaving the standard comment.

Points 1 and 2 are both against SE policy, and would turn the Q&A format into a forum of threaded messages, so point 3 would be the correct "SE way" of doing things. However, it does also mean that these new users:

Don't get any help, and;
Seem to get scared off.

Any ideas how to fix this? Or am I worrying too much?
I guess a user with enough rep could (if they know the answer), briefly undelete the answer, leave a comment as to provide a solution, and then re-delete it. However, this is a double edged sword: this wouldn't encourage the new user to post their own question, although it would give them the help that they need. Also, not only does it encourage bad SE etiquette, we probably don't have enough users with sufficient rep to do this.
Another way of looking at it is that, if the new user really needs help then they will post their own question, and if they don't post one, then they weren't all that desperate, after all.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New users aren't posting their own questions - are we scaring them off?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most people posting their first question don't know the rules at SE. I don't think we should bend the rules. Just delete their answer but leave a message to post their own question. We should stick to option 3 IMHO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it possible to add option "Turn into question" available only to answer's author? - for example only if the answer has been flagged? For example in my case, I am trying to give answers, but so far I did not add any new question. Why...? I plan to do some research before, including searching the knowledge base prior to asking... thus, maybe I am afraid to introduce duplicate, or prefer to remain in comfort zone. (And the last sentence about desperation is true.) Maybe this is just psychology, therefore I propose such shortcut / incentive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@octopus8 - Nope, not without a feature request being submitted to SE.Meta (which would be a very good idea). Currently, there's nothing in the UI to do that. There may already be such a request, have a look. I vaguely recall the topic (but not a UI feature request) being discussed, and apparently it was something to do with moderators shouldn't be able to force the user to do something (i.e. write a question for them, when maybe they don't want to). But, hold on, you are saying for the user, and the user only, to do? Then that would be a very good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure if you've changed how you're handling flags but recently I noticed a lot of my NAA flags are being marked disputed even though they're being deleted straight away, for example: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/7634/how-do-i-calibrate-the-temperature-of-my-hotend/15477#15477b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterJ Could be caused by the system, mods get a review (summary) of flags, but with very little content (probably caused by SO as they get hundreds of flags per day), sometimes it is not obvious from that interface if the flag should be honored or not, in such cases I go to the question and do the modding, this may surpass the flag and mark it as dispute? It certainly is not intentional! Your (and others') moderation flagging is highly appreciated!


















Yeah, it's a bit long, apologies. But I feel it is worth bringing up.
Many questions are actually /q/83/troubleshooting questions. You may try to answer them to unblock the concerned who stuck, but number of possible causes, which mean many degrees of freedom... so sometimes you can only guess. Also about skills of the asking person (sign me up). Definitely nothing to complain about, there is learning curve and its laws. But these guess-answers will often lead to:

opening an discussion in comments, not very promising because of limited and not-so-interactive nature of comments,
abandoning the question by disheartened user, who may find it too hard, misleading, or even https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28/answers-that-dont-answer-the-questionnot answering the question.

So:

Should we propose a chat to discuss doubts and do troubleshooting, when comments start growing? Is it accepted practice in the process? Is it good in your opinion?

Troubleshooting is very specific and rather short-living discussion. What chat room to use the best? I suppose that creating new room for each issue should be avoided. So far I could not learn the real nature of https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-roomPublic 3D Printing Room (yet?), but to me it seems proper for higher-level subjects (of some wider use, for community, etc.).
So maybe it would be better to have a separate chat(s) for ad hoc troubleshooting. Maybe to revitalize https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/the-hotbed-3d-printingThe Hotbed for such purpose? This name even sounds appropriate for all the urgency and surgery ;)

If the question contents sounds more like panic button press, rather than effect of understanding to the reasonable limits with conscious research, should we propose switching to chat immediately instead of throwing hints and discouraging prompts? I am aware that few of us is going to assist for longer period, but still it more transparent and better then in comments, and there is a change for more people to join in and even take over the subject. Great chance to mix skills and specialities, instead of trying to offer half-answers.

More interactive approach would lead to more successful answers. This will help growing this community by having more users coming back, with increasing awareness - I suppose this is key factor. It's easier to summarize results of colloquial chat as a question improvement or as an answer, than write literary paragraph with all possibly important details (and then you have to read all of it back and forth). It would be also more convenient to remind of accepting answers or even voting due to gratitude - which made in comments seems to have an opposite effect (sometimes like admonishing; lifeless automated reminders work much better for such reasons).


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Troubleshooting questions - suggesting redirection to the chat?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's one flaw: new users with less than some reputation **can't** access chat, even if invited.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Trish - yeah, that's really annoying.


















Moving discussions to chat is automatically suggested when the amount of comments is becoming too high. This is a separate chat between the discussing users, but not limited, I've entered many of those rooms later to pitch in. The generic https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-roomPublic 3D Printing Room can be used for any 3D related problem, discussion or a friendly hang-out chat.
Chat requires a 20 reputation. https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-voteHence the voting is key, this is what is killing us, too less people feel the urge to put in a vote. Currently we have only https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=all15 users that have voted more than 500 times. Special https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badgesbadges (Moderation Badges) are to be earned, e.g.

[Civic Duty] -> Vote 300 or more times (awarded only 18 times to date!)
[Electorate] -> Vote on 600 questions and 25% or more of total votes are on questions (awarded only 7 times to date!)
[Vox Populi] -> Use the maximum 40 votes in a day (awarded only 29 times to date!)

If the question is from a new user and half decent we should vote up to reward the question so that the user is able to enter the chat. Similar for answers, I've seen answers that are good but still not receive the votes and attention the answer should receive. Voting doesn't cost anything. If you don't agree with an answer, you could also withhold your vote and only down vote if something is completely wrong.
I know that various members are already trying to limit the amount of comments and invite people to discuss further in chat. Please continue to do so, this may lead to updating the question and the answer!

In response to argarza's https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/500/useful-things-to-check-for-when-cleaning-up-posts/515#comment807_500comment:

How should menu items in software, i.e. Cura, or settings, i.e. 'Layer Height', be formatted?


Formatting menu items
I normally use Bold. However, I have seen other people use italics. It's probably best to stick to one or the other. Shall we say Bold? I (personally) prefer bold as it seems clearer to me.
Italics would be more suited for use as stressing a point or a particular word, IMHO.
For a menu delimiter, I normally use this character: ► (&#x25B6;), as it (again) is clearer to see. So for example a hierarchical menu would look like:
File ► Print...
or
View ► Developer ► View Source
Note: that the arrow is not bolded, here is the actual markdown:
**View** ► **Developer** ► **View Source**`

I've also seen code formatting used for menus, but IMHO, I think it looks nasty, see https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/18/6936this answer (which, incidentally, is where I lifted the arrow from).

Note: This is not an official "Stack Exchange" policy (I'm not even sure that one exists, w.r.t. formatting menu items or what-have-you).

I've tried to get all editing information together https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/303219/812149here on MSO. A few rules of thumb: quote markdown is only for quotes. code markdown is only for code. Personally, I also believe that boldface and italics should be avoided when possible.

I propose that we add Direct Ink Writing (DIW) and Melt Electro-Writing (MEW) to the list of on-topic subjects at https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic
https://labs.wsu.edu/mpml/projects/Direct Ink Writing:

Direct-Ink-Writing (DIW) is an extrusion-based additive manufacturing method heavily utilized in meso- and micro-scales. In DIW, the liquid-phase “ink” is dispensed out of small nozzles under controlled flow rates and deposited along digitally defined paths to fabricate 3D structures layer-by-layer.

https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/melt-electrowriting-where-are-we-now/Melt Electro-Writing

MEW utilizes an electric field uniquely coupled with AM technology for the controlled deposition of a molten polymer jet, which rapidly solidifies into a fiber. These submicron fibers can be consistently laid on top of each other,  resulting in the ability to direct-write complex and multi-scaled architectures and structures, and overcoming the resolution challenge that a majority of other additive manufacturing technologies encounter.

My request to have these additive manufacturing techniques added to the list of on-topic subjects is driven by the facts that:

These are valid Additive Manufacturing processes; and

The company for which I work, http://hyrel3d.comHyrel 3D, has customers (mostly at universities) using these processes.

Personally I have no idea what they are. Are they additive printing? The name suggests that they are just writing (similar to engraving). Do you want to add them because they are similar to CNC? Maybe I'm being dumb, but maybe you could expand upon your proposal and say what they are and why you want them added(?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline Proposal added to, thanks.


















I've just noticed this Meta post, https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/364007/280335Testing three-vote close and reopen on 13 network sites and I wondered whether we should employ it here, and what do other people think?
We are a smallish site, with a smallish number of active users (although it isn't that small, and is slowly growing over time, it should be noted). We don't have a problem with review queues building up except with the close votes. Some questions do seem to hang around for a while in the close queue.
The problem with the close vote review queue requiring 5 votes when there is a limited number of active reviewers (where two of which are moderators) is this: If a moderator votes, then the question is automatically closed, even if there aren't 5 votes - if a moderator casts the first vote to close then the question is closed straight away, without waiting for another four votes - so the vote is not democratic, but instead, dictatorial in nature. As such, moderators tend to not vote, unless the question blatantly needs closing (i.e. spam, vulgarity, etc.).
There are ways around this problem:

sock puppets (moderators have a fake account to cast votes only in the review queue), or;
waiting for four votes and then a moderator casting the fifth vote (or waiting for three votes and then moderators agreeing (behind the scenes) to cast the final two votes, etc.)

However, these aren't ideal, and just shortening the queue might make things better. This need not be a permanent change, I guess, so if this site, for some reason, eventually exploded in popularity, the review queue could go back to five votes (but I'm not 100 % sure about that, see the SE.Meta post above to check).
So... should SE.3DP jump on the "three votes to close" train? Or are things OK as they are? What do other users think? Please leave a comment or answer.
To make things super simple, and if you don't have time to write a comment or answer, you can just vote on the Yes answer or the No answer.
End of voting date
To give this vote an end point, and not make it so opened-ended, I guess we should tally a "final" vote on the 1st July 2021 - which is May 6 (trial start date) plus 45 days (length of trial) plus a little bit more. As we can't join the trial halfway through, there isn't much point to tallying up the votes before that.
At that point Catija will be sent the results.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does this 3D Printing site want only three votes to close (or should we stick with five)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please note: Catija has been [notified](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2681/3-vote-close-hows-it-going) of the results (8-1 in favour as of this date).


















Yes, we should have a three vote close question review queue

Note that three used to be the default, but large sites required five: `We ended up with five votes to close based on very specific feedback from the early days of closure and the very immature state of review, though it had previously been three.`b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @0scar; for a small population site, three votes should be plenty.  What's our membership here, a few hundred?  And how many of those have review privileges?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ZeissIkon - you can see the users' statistics [here](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/265/4762). review queues at 350 rep and close votes at 500 rep - see [Privileges](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/privileges).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, @Greenonline.  My guess wasn't far off.  Heh.  I'm "in on the ground floor."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are a tiny community.

No, we should stay with the five vote close question review queue

Why? Because a number of stupid reasons: (a) I don't like closing things; (b) I don't like change; (c) The system sort of works as it is (with the mods using their super-powers to clean things up); (d) laziness, and; (e) I like playing "devil's advocate"... *All of which* are bad reasons to vote "No", I agree - but that is my vote.


















I put a bounty on https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/16474/why-is-my-ender-3-restarting-spontaneously-in-mid-printthis question, because the one answer it had seemed as if the answerer hadn't read the (admittedly long) question.
The bounty just expired, and according to the message, I "must award it to an answer within 24 hours."
Only problem is, there are no answers (the one that was there when I raised the bounty has been deleted).  I don't have an answer of my own to self-answer, the problem I asked about is still unsolved.  How can I proceed in this case?

Sometimes there are just no answers, especially on very particular problems. :-( Note that the question itself is clear, the problem on the other hand is very difficult to grasp, I'm still inclined to put it in the category of a broken cable that sometimes loses connection or shorts as a result of the movement of the nozzle carriage, I've experienced that myself with a faulty BLTouch cable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That doesn't seem to stop people trying to answer (and even getting votes from similarly clueless readers) on other SE sites...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll try to do an experiment early in a throw-away print -- I'll pull the extruder or z-axis stepper cable (those are fixed location and accessible while running) and see if that will stop the machine (effectively, simulating a broken wire disconnect).

Fortunately the https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/bountyHelp Center helps out:

How is a bounty awarded?
The bounty period lasts 7 days. Bounties must have a minimum duration of at least 1 day. After the bounty ends, there is a grace period of 24 hours to manually award the bounty. Simply click the bounty award icon next to each answer to permanently award your bounty to the answerer. (You cannot award a bounty to your own answer.)
If you do not award your bounty within 7 days (plus the grace period), the highest voted answer created after the bounty started with a minimum score of 2 will be awarded half the bounty amount (or the full amount, if the answer is also accepted). >If two or more eligible answers have the same score (their scores are tied), the oldest answer is chosen. If there's no answer meeting those criteria, no bounty is awarded to anyone.
If the bounty was started by the question owner, and the question owner accepts an answer posted during the bounty period, and the bounty expires without an explicit award then we assume the bounty owner liked the answer they accepted and award it the full bounty amount at the time of bounty expiration.
As a special bonus, any reputation you earn from being awarded a bounty is exempt from the daily reputation cap.

There has to be answer to award the bounty, in this particular case there aren't any answers, so no bounty can be rewarded. The messages you receive are the standard messages. You cannot select an answer, nor can the system. If the deleted answer hadn't been deleted, the negative score would have prevented from being selected by the system as it needs a 2+ vote for automatic rewarding.
Basically, you cannot do anything. You could consider removing (deleting) the question, this is a very particular / intermittent failure that is very difficult to troubleshoot. You might find the solution yourself one day!

I hope you once find the solution and post it yourself. The banner will be gone after the grace period has ended.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5k.  If I find a solution, you may rest assured I'll post it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The solution is, if you don't award the points, the points go away and nobody gets them. There is nothing stating you ***have*** to award the points. If there's nothing you can award the points to, then that's that. This is how the system works. I'm not sure what there would be to troubleshot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 The solution mentioned in comments hints to the solution of https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/16474/why-is-my-ender-3-restarting-spontaneously-in-mid-print not the solution of this question :-)


















Our site has the default Stack Exchange logo (text balloon with text 3D), is it possible to change this logo?

Yes, we can! Or at least discuss if we like a different logo.
From https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/298341/this answer on Meta Stack Exchange question "https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/298338/whats-the-process-to-change-a-site-logoWhat's the process to change a site logo?" we can read:

If you have an issue with a logo on a site, the best place to start is to open a discussion on that site's meta. Tag it https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discussiondiscussion and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/designdesign, and see what the overall community feeling is.

Another part reads:

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99338/who-are-the-community-team-and-what-do-they-doCommunity managers monitor per-site metas, so if/when the discussion concludes and the site's community largely supports a change, they can bring your concerns to the design team.

There is no specific mention if Beta state sites can modify the logo, Beta sites share the smae layout set out by the Stack Exchange designers:

Our designers come up with the overall site design (including the logo), with some input from the communities. (With the exception of sites that are still in beta or have only recently graduated - those all share the same design.)

However, we can start a discussion whether we would like to have a different logo/favicon. Feel free to add your thoughts ans an aswer to the question.

Related to the recent question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/18141/4762How to determine the firmware and firmware version of a Frankensbox fx-800? and given that:

The Frankensbox FX-800 is a rebranded Dedibot DF3;
The support for the Frankenbox appears to be, to say the least, somewhat lacking in the useful department;
There is slightly more useful support available for the Dedibot DF3 to be found on the web.

Would it be sensible to make the existing https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/frankensbox-fx-800frankensbox-fx-800 tag, actually an synonym of a new tag (say https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dedibot-df3dedibot-df3), which, in addition to any brief summary of the DF3, also makes reference to the FX-800 being a rebranded DF3?
This linking of aliases might help people, who are looking for information on the Frankensbox, realise that they should widen their searches to include the DF3.
Does this aliasing fit in well with our recent reorganisation of tags for printer models and brands?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Frankenstein's synonymb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not a regular here and having no knowledge about the product, so just a comment: if it's only a rebranding and there's no difference in the features/capabilities, I feel it makes sense to add a tag synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah thanks, yes "synonym" not "alias". That's what I meant :-)


















A synonym is a solution to let people choose the tag they think is the correct one (the synonym), but gets converted to another tag (the target).
From https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/suggest-tag-synonyms3D Printing Stack Exchange -> Help center -> Privileges:

What happens when a question is asked using a synonym?
Any tags that match active synonyms will be automatically and silently changed from their original as-entered form to the tag that the synonym points to.

The downside is that there is no predefined synonym to choose from! (drop-down list)
E.g. if you make a synonym tag https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/frankensbox-fx-800frankensbox-fx-800 for the target tag https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dedibot-df3dedibot-df3, the user creating the tag to the question needs to be exactly typed in as frankensbox-fx-800, i.e. there is no pop-up for suggestions of the tag you are about to use. So, when the OP enters fx800frankensbox or frankensbox-fx800 this might not work, and the user is not presented with the frankensbox-fx-800 option...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I see. That's a bit annoying. So maybe just have two separate tags, and in the frankensbox tag, just state that it is really a DF-3? Mind you, it's not like we actually get many frankensbox questions... so we could just type the tag in ourselves (i.e. the active tagging members of the user base)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline Actually, the OP has bought a Frankensbox, so it is a Frankensbox, not a Dedibot, so why would we want to make a synonym. It is better to mention in the tag description that the Frankensbox is now known under Dedibot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, that's what I meant - leave it tagged as it is, but in the frankensbox tag description add the rebranding info. I'm not sure why I mentioned the other tag - I sort of thought that we should create a DF-3 tag anyway (purely to have a complete set), but I *now* realise that it is pointless as we don't actually have any questions about a DF-3 (yet). :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"E.g. if you make a synonym tag [tag:frankensbox-fx-800] for the target tag [tag:dedibot-df3], the user creating the tag to the question needs to be exactly typed in as `frankensbox-fx-800`, i.e. there is no pop-up for suggestions of the tag you are about to use." – This isn't entirely correct. If you start typing the name of the tag (even if you don't type out the whole thing) in the tag bar (i.e. when editing a post's tags), then if what you've typed is included in the tag name (or the tag description as well, which I think is a more recent change), the system will suggest that tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So in this case, if [tag:frankensbox-fx-800] is a synonym pointing to [tag:dedibot-df3], then if you start typing `frankensbox` in the tag area for a question, then the system will include [dedibot-df3] in the tags it suggests (if that's one of the top 6 results for the tag text you typed, at least). The same is true if you start typing `fx-800` instead, since it's also part of the name of the synonymized tag.

We use physical units a lot and demand the SI formatting. Let me quote from Worldbuilding:

Chemistry Stack Exchange is obviously the main consumer of this feature and has a https://worldbuilding.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9710/can-we-extend-mhchem-support-in-mathjax-to-include-physical-units?cb=1nice FAQ on its use. The chemists get two things that we don't:

They get physical unit formatting via $\pu{273.15 K}$, which currently renders as a grumpy error on WB.SE and WB meta that looks [with only mhchem enabled] like this https://i.stack.imgur.com/NyXoU.png

For values and units I haven't used the MathJax notation (only for complex equations), I've always used the html characters for formatting values and units.
The example from the question would be written as:
273.15&nbsp;K

which renders to "273.15 K"
or in Celsius:
0&nbsp;&deg;C

which renders to "0 °C".
The drawback of using the LaTeX style from MathJax (and presumably with mhchem support) is that the rendered value and unit are in a different font, for example:




Text rendering
MathJax rendering
MathJax code




273.15 K
$273.15\ \text{K}$
$273.15\ \text{K}$


0 °C
$0\ ^\text{o}\text{C}$
$0\ ^\text{o}\text{C}$ or $0\ ^\circ\text{C}$

It's been almost a whole year since this was escalated this to the Community Team, so I apologize for the delay in actually processing the request! But the good news is you now officially only need 3 close votes to close a question on 3D Printing SE!
After looking at the data, I think it's clear that there's no reason for y'all to have this set at 5. Thank you so much for bearing with us while we got to this request.
We'll check back in with you all in a few months to see how things are going — if things are going great, we may not post an update but please feel free to leave a comment if you want us to post something.
Here's some basic stats of how things look:
Over the last two years, you've had heavy fluctuations in effectiveness, when looking into what percentage of questions that received at least one flag or vote to close actually ended up getting closed. As you can see, the effectiveness is in the 60%~100% range — the good news is that the numbers of posts this represents are relatively small (always under 20 posts per month).

https://i.stack.imgur.com/iT5UH.png
The graph below, however, does show something that is a bit more concerning:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/922SP.png
This shows that the moderation team is doing the bulk of the closing, which can be problematic because the mods shouldn't be making these decisions on their own, even with other users weighing in. To add a bit more nuance, though, it looks like the moderation is not single-handedly closing the posts, but rather stepping in to aid the community on a big chunk of cases — the graph below shows which vote the moderators cast, to close posts:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DeBm.png
When working on this project, Catija had found two primary use cases for this change:

When too many items are going unhandled (not unclosed, just unhandled)
When the moderators are doing the bulk of the closing/reopening.

Because the mods here are casting the bulk of the final close votes, the first graph looks good (at least in the months where 100% effectiveness is reached). However, this creates an imbalance between closing and reopening as the mods now have to be really thoughtful about reviewing for reopening.
So, my hope is that changing this to three votes to close/reopen will take some of the workload off the mods and also increase the number of posts that find their way to be reopened - assuming it's worth reopening them!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you very much for sorting this out. I would like to add that the moderators do *try* not to close single handedly, but rather wait for at least two other votes, thereby making our vote the third... I think that it is fair to say that waiting for an additional third or fourth community vote usually means that a bad question hangs around for waaay too long, perhaps indefinitely... Often there are only two community votes - it's a small (active) community. The mods will try to discuss the third close vote in mod chat, making it a better concensus (rather than just a dictatorial third vote).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To clarify: it's not a problem that mods cast close votes in and of itself. Rather, it can only be somewhat concerning if the majority of closed posts are closed by mods, which seems to be the case here. But, to your point, I'm aware that the community is rather small, and that because of that the other option might be that the close votes end up just aging away — and since y'all do wait so your vote isn't the first one, it's even less concerning that you're casting the votes. That being said, hopefully the adjustment helps with removing the need for y'all to _have_ to cast the votes at all.


















The deed is done. Behold! In all its glory:
$$\pu{273.15 K}$$

I'm aware I cannot ask for recommendations and I'm not interested into.
But I'm looking for a specific feature of a 3D printer and since my primary language is not English I'm not sure which is the correct word (or words) to describe such a feature.
My question would be like this: "I'm looking for an enclosed 3D printer that allows to load a common 1 kg filament bobbin. Do these bobbins rely on a specific standard? How to filter out the printers that match my request when making a Google search?"
Is this question acceptable for you?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Am I allowed to ask the correct name for a specific feature?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's fine, with generic terms like that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In general, I don't think this sort of question would have the problems that come with recommendation-type questions. (Recommendation questions tend to be very subjective in terms of what the best product is, and also tend to be time-specific in that product availability/prices/etc. often changes over time.) That said, whether it'd be a good question and whether the community wants to allow such questions may be a different matter.


















Is the Stack Exchange 3d printing site likely to remain active in the foreseeable future?
There seem to be some challenges, e.g. competition with the likes of Reddit, the change of management with the sale of Stack Exchange.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is 3dprinting.stackexchange.com likely to still be active in the foreseeable future?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All answers will be speculation, that being said, the quality and format of different alternatives is not that good. I've followed Reddit for a while, many answers aren't that great or helpful and sometimes even incorrect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see any reason to expect that our metrics will change unexpectedly... what am I missing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Davo For those with a reputation over 5k, [site-analytics](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/site-analytics) shows it is more or less increasing over the years (discarding the [recent drop](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/381668/google-analytics-4-ga4-upgrade) as a recent change to Google Analytics 4).


















As we are out of beta, it is unlikely that we will be "cancelled". However, regardling the sale of SE, that was over a year ago, it is probably best to refer to https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/365050/280335What does the recent sale of Stack Exchange mean for the community? Only the new owners would know for sure what their intentions are, anything else would be pure speculation.
With respect to Reddit, as 0scar has stated, it doesn't seem to be much of a threat given the quality of questions, answers and advice given. Unless you are aware of any specific challenges relating to Reddit - that you allude to in your question, but don't provide any evidence of (do you have any links or references to are cause for concern?).
Nevertheless, that doesn't mean to say that there isn't the possibility of a vastly superior knowledge base emerging in the future... established players in a particular field can, and often do, change - after all, who remembers "Wang" these days?
The main problem at the moment seems to be the perceived drop off in visits and posts (be that real or imaginary, see https://stackoverflow.com/c/moderators/q/4631/412What caused our site's traffic to drop by 75% starting from May 11th?). There certainly seem to be a lot fewer posts, as well as less activity, on this site since the late spring of 2022.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To comment on the fewer post, there has always been a variable sinusoid curve peaking around Christmas, looking at the weekly posted questions there are a little less questions, but isn't that expected. With good questions we gain a vast base which doesn't require people to post their own questions, they might have found the answer already! Personally I find it harder and harder to think of original questions to add to our knowledgebase to share my experience.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, looking at the changing world, people (especially the younger generation when looking at my kids) want video's while old timers like me prefer a webpage with text. I simply cannot get used to watching a video over and over rewinding to find out what the poster did or meant. But I might be one of the few... hence the diminishing amount of questions.


















I have added https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/automatic-bed-levelingautomatic-bed-leveling and retagged the two questions that were using the incorrectly spelt https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/automaticbedlevlingautomaticbedlevling.
I have also added a synonym https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ablabl.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice! Thanks for checking this out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice work! I even didn't know we had an automatic bed levelling tag, no wonder it's just 2 tagged questions... You always see the bed-levelling tag being used. Makes me wonder, maybe we should revisit many questions and change the tag when automatic levelling is meant in the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - yeah, I was thinking that too... but there's 228 questions to go through! :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - One question is, should a question about auto-bed levelling be tagged with *both* bed-leveling *and* auto-bed-leveling tags? The more you think about it, the more ramifications or issues you end up thinking about. The most obvious one is: You'll end up having to look up both tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline 228 is doable ;-) and not both tags, it may be better to introduce a `automatic` tag insteadb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@0scar - if we are thinking about having a question tagged with both an `automatic` (prefix tag) and `bed-leveling` tags, then we had just as well stick with tagging with both `automatic-bed-leveling` and `bed-leveling` tags - because the end result would be the same: two tags. I don't think that having two tags is necessarily a bad idea... `automatic-bed-leveling` would just end up being a subset of `bed-leveling`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline Tags are limited per question, so it is best to not have to multiple tag questions. It is better for the regulars to retag bed-levelling to automatic-bed-levelling when appropriate.


















I personally think that there should be no more than two sentences in a tag excerpt, and ideally if it contains one short sentence. Something like this is a good example:

For questions about the Creality Ender 3 family of 3D printers.

Tag excerpts should start with:

For questions about...
For questions related to...
For questions regarding...

Tag description is a separate matter, in which there should be a more detailed description.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point about how to start the excerpt. It would be nice if they were all consistent. "For questions about..." is a good one. I'm sure that there is a meta question about this somewhere. I had a quick look earlier, but couldn't find the question that I was thinking about.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let know if you find it.


















It is a good question, and can be difficult to answer.
It shouldn't be too long, as you have already noted, but it also should not just point out the obvious. That is to say, if the tag is https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filamentfilament, then the excerpt should definitely not just be:

For questions about filament

as it is not only obvious but also adds nothing that the name of the tag doesn't already provide.
I would suggest that it would be better to put:

For general questions about filament used for 3D Printing. For questions about specific filament types, see the tags https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plapla, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/petgpetg, ... <and list the tags1>

Basically, if it is obviously what the tag refers to, then point out what the tag is not meant to be used for -  in order to prevent its misuse...
However, if the tag name is somewhat obscure then clearly it would be a good idea to spell out what it should be used for.
Clearly, the line between obvious and not obvious could be a bit of a grey area, and not distinct, depending upon the tag.

Footnotes
1 When listing related tags, make them active UI elements by using the appropriate markdown, like so:
[tag:filament], [tag:PLA], [tag:PETG], etc.

Some info when to use this tag instead of others can also be useful. In your example, point 4. from question's link suits perfect and should be taken into consideration.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, quite. Your [excerpt for stringing](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/16761) inspired me to post this answer. It seems a little bit obvious. However, off hand, I'm not quite sure what additional text would improve the excerpt..? Or even, if it needs improving. At least, your edit is better than it was, which was blank (I think, not sure). Anyway, thanks for looking into the tags, it is a job that needed doing :-)


















There used to be a reputation milestone of 200, https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/reduced-adsreduce ads, which reduced the amount of visible advertising.
However, I notice that on our https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesPrivileges page it doesn't see to be there. I'm not sure if it was there previously, and has been removed, or was never there. I don't remember it being so, but was this just a privilege only on Stack Overflow?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@greenoline It's the leaderboard ads that aren't visible to people with 200+ rep who have that enabled. Side bar ads would still be visible as they are on SO stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/reduced-ads. These will display the same way as they have on SO.


















Can you show examples of this? I wasn't aware and it sounds baffling.
Are there robots crawling the site and posting garbage answers just because? Or are they posting spammy links for example, like the good old days when we had blogs and the comments would be full of those unless we enabled a captcha?
Also, being an ESL myself, 0scar made a good point. Sometimes people have wonky English but they are still human.

Think about a print volume to quality spreadsheet for an SLS printer while discussing an FDM printer and talking about temperature in the extruder on a bowden style machine (which is the *motion* system of the filament. that is only close to the meltzone in a direct drive machine) - Things that triggered mental images of fleeting knowledge about *some* aspects but missing blatantly obvious other parts.
