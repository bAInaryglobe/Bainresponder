Should there be a difference? My proposal


[mac] relates to hardware
[osx] relates to the software
[apple] relates to the company specifically.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the difference between [mac] and [apple]?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and is the site specifically for mac hardware or does it include other apple hardware (iphone, ipad, time capsule, etc) as well?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would assume any hardware.


















Let’s define Hackintosh (also OSx86 before the PPC to intel transition) as Mac OS X running on non-Apple hardware. 

Since the people that know best Apple software are here, is one allowed to ask questions pertaining to a Hackintosh here?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can one ask Hackintosh questions on Ask Different?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5shouldn't this be like a community wiki or something?  How does one person get to ask and accept an answer that could affect the entire userbase?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: We take our cues from parent sites. Also they can "accept" any answer they want, it doesn't change the fact that the answer comes (almost directly) from precedent set on SU.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First of all, SuperUser is not the "parent" site of this site.  Second, you're right, they can "accept" any answer they want, but it doesn't change the fact that a precedent set on SU doesn't necessarily apply to this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we change the title of this question to use the expression *Ask Different* instead of *Apple (beta)*? Whilst there's an accepted answer, it's not [status-completed](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/tags/status-completed/info) and the question **is** a very useful point of reference in questions such as [What's the advantage of buying an iMac over building a Hackintosh?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/8392/8546). Thanks. Side note: would [status-completed] ever apply to a question such as this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Graham Perrin: Done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How does the pro-Hackintosh consensus on this question relate to the [Help page](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) saying “Installing or using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware (and most other explicitly unlicensed use of product)” was off-topic?


















I don't believe questions that put the answers or askers into a legal quandary are acceptable. 

This is an Apple Q / A site. If it's not Apple it is off topic. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Pystar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psystar) sells Hackintoshes. And it plans to appeal a recent judgement. I'm not sure if it is legally illegal. But whatever the community says. =)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i don't think that there is any consensus one way or another on whether installing osx non-apple hardware is actually illegal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ashish: Just because they are appealing doesn't mean what they are doing is legal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Josh K: there have not been any legal cases that i am aware of involving home users installing os x on non-apple hardware.  There is no legal precedent to my knowledge that makes this illegal.  Selling non-apple hardware containing apple software for profit is a whole different beast from personal and fair use application.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: It's against the EULA. That means it's not legal. Simply because Apple isn't chasing people down for doing it (like, uh, RIAA) doesn't make it any more supportable or legal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Josh K: an EULA is not law, and  uses that go against the EULA are not illegal.  In fact, a company or individual can put ANYTHING they want into an EULA.  They could say that by using the software you are giving them the right to take your first born son into slavery, but it doesn't give it any more legality than if they walked up to you on the street and told you the same.  What makes an EULA enforceable is law and or legal precedent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: Yeah, and Pystar lost. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Josh: Did you read what I wrote?  Once again... I'm not talking about for-profit undertakings, I'm talking about fair use.  Unless you were implying you work for the RIAA and already have an opinion on the subject.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: I'm simply pointing out that there *is* legal precedent for this. Also, I don't understand how where I work (not for the RIAA) would matter *in the slightest* about my opinions on fair use, or where you could even conceive the notion I would imply that they did.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Josh: Yet your legal precedent has nothing to do with fair use.  You brought the RIAA into this context. The RIAA lawsuits don't even slightly resemble what we're talking about here. The RIAA goes after PIRATES. If you can show me one case where the RIAA went after somebody for moving their music from one media to another for their own personal use without distributing it, then you may have a point. Second, it appears that you're still talking about Psystar, which is a for-profit enterprise that was selling hardware running software which they were not licensed to sell in that manner.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Take these two cases for example. Case 1: person buys used lawnmower engine. Person puts said engine in a go kart and drives it around the block on weekends.  Case 2: person buys 1000 lawnmower engines. Person refits the engines into a whole different set of lawnmowers, then sells said lawnmowers to consumers without the permission of the original lawnmower manufacturer.  Are you starting to see the difference yet?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: Yes, they are not longer driving Brand X lawnmowers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm glad you now see the light.  BRAND Y FTW :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: Lol. Well this is a Brand X SE site. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not even really sure what we're talking about anymore :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank God X someone finally admitted it ;) oh, and no matter how many times I look up meanings of *FTW* I'm never sure what it means, in context …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd love someone to flesh out this "no" answer with some more logic on how we might implement this. What laws should govern? Who will know what is unlawful? If you are going to prose that people moderate on the basis of legality - we will need some serious thinking to consider how this might happen (assuming there is community interest in this point of view of course).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The site is about Apple hardware and software. If the hardware isn't Apple, the software certainly is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From the first comment - Pystar lost so badly I don't even think it's worth considering as an argument any more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is such an old answer I'm not sure it can be improved given current dynamics. I think a good line to draw would be what _is_ supported and encouraged in terms of content and questions and leave everything else as a subjective case-by-case basis.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The second question could be applicable to installing 3rd party video cards in a Mac Pro.


















What is the list of tags we should not allow? Much like how on most other SE sites tags like homework, subjective, etc. have been disallowed. It doesn't stop anybody from asking homework-related or subjective questions but at least we don't actually roll out the red carpet.

For more info check out: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/51627/should-we-permanently-remove-the-subjective-tagShould we permanently remove the [subjective] tag? on Meta.SO.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow "useless" tags and what are "useless" tags for Apple.SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to lock this. With two questions, it got the discussion started in 2010 but isn't answerable or continuing the discussion today.


















Why should we not allow [mac] or [apple] tags? 

Is there a distinct clutter benefit to not allowing them? 

Some tags that I think we should not allow:


[linux]
[windows]


Okay, just a joke. I can't think of any tags that shouldn't be allowed, except for standard subjective questions, questions that are clearly argumentative (windows-vs-mac?) or spiteful (i-can't-google).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As was proposed in the other question on the subject, [apple] as a tag makes a great deal of sense for questions about the company. [osx] for general OS questions seems fine as well. [mac] however, feels very superfluous to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Less: Then submit and answer indicating that. I'm starting to feel the same way however. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't have the rep to before!


















Hackintosh questions are a legal grey area and because of that they are not allowed on Super User anymore. For the same reason I believe they should not be allowed on Apple.SE either.



EDIT: This really needs to be hashed out more as to what kind of Hackintosh questions should be allowed and not (These are my opinions and are subject to change):


If you're running an Hackintosh and you have a question about OS X it shouldn't matter. Figuring out how to get a piece of hardware to work - I don't know as it has a lot of merits but at the same time the chance of a lot of unanswered too localized questions is high - I say let them be for now.
Howto questions aren't acceptable and I've found the majority far too localized to be useful. Apple.SE should not be the place for them.
What about running Mac OS X on unsupported Apple-branded computers (eg. Apple TV or older models)? I think this is fine - the internet ends up being the unsupported's support but it's not a far jump to any hardware and normal Hackintoshes.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wasn't aware Super User had gotten rid of them. In that case there isn't point in discussing something someone has already discussed. =)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ashish: I wasn't aware until I found out on chat.meta today. Turns out it's been that way for 3 or 4 months.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion can you provide a link to this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: See Diago's comment on http://superuser.com/questions/110963/a-little-macos-10-6-hackintosh-help-closedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion: thanks, I checked it out.  One thing I noticed, however, is that there a many questions on the "related" section to the right that have not been closed or moderated, and ones that were closed or moderated were for reasons other than "legal grey area".  As far as I know, this is a "we the people" kind of site, as long as the site owners do not object.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: A lot of them are older and the moderation on it is not very consistent if only because SU doesn't really have any moderators that use the osx tag until Diago came back.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Calvera Also be aware that policy changes aren't retroactively applied. If the policy changes today, questions will only be addressed when they become visible. Sometimes the time required to go back and apply the policy is way to complex and hard.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Diago: I'm glad you joined the discussion :)  So where does this policy come from, and is it applicable to this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calvera It was more a warning and a protection of the site rather then a policy. Among other things the validity of the site needs to be protected, and the last thing needed is Apple taking on SE because of a violation of some agreement no one knows about. Hackintoshes fall in a grey area, so the though was to stay out of it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion What makes Hackintoshs illegal?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Brian Bolton: Depending on where you live - breaking an EULA may be classified as illegal. Regardless you're breaking the license agreement between you and Apple. Whether that's legally enforceable or not adds the moral issue as well - I consider it like asking how to make a hackintosh questions like asking questions on where to download music, movies, etc. because the downloading of those products is a legal grey area and one most more reputable areas just plain avoid. This just isn't the place for that question. It may very well play out the community wants these too localized questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think bringing the download issue into it again clouds the issue.  Downloading music, movies, retail software, etc, is NOT a legal grey area.  It's obviously illegal, people have been prosecuted for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: Some geographical areas it is a legal grey area (eg. Canada when it comes to downloading music and only music). Other areas (eg. the US) it's quite definitive. It's not meant to equate one with the other. In the end I see them both (howtos for Hackintoshes and pirating) as examples of questions that just aren't suited for Apple.SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion in response to your latest edit: I think we're pretty much in agreement.  I don't want a bunch of questions like "Howz do I makez a hakintosh lol"...  I think the points you make here are pretty similar to what I was trying to say in my answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How is a Hackintosh  different from an unlocked iPhone or iPod? As long as questions and answers are generally applicable to most video cards/mobos/etc. they should be fine.  As for legality, we'll all be in real trouble when EULA's are regarded as actually enforceable by law. Those things are ridiculously verbose, mostly unenforceable, and you're better off not reading them unless you're trying to sell something like hacked Apple software.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion Do you think their should be a dedicated SE site for the Hackintosh Community instead ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5LOL, yeah, I'm pretty sure Hackintosh questions are not allowed on [Apple.SE](http://apple.se/) :)


















Like Josh K said, answering questions on topics that are not supported by Apple id not a good thing and, moreover, they are illegal.

For these two points, I don't thing we should answer them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If your answer essentially contains an opinion held in another answer, commend and upvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Josh K: I agree. Oh, wait, I should up-vote your comment instead. :P
Now I did.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5so does this mean we should ban all hacking related questions?  how about software that is not endorsed by apple?  is that within scope?  (not being sarcastic, I'm really trying to get to the bottom of this debate)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: None apple endorsed applications? What are you talking about? This is a general question about running OS X on non-apple hardware, not apple endorsed applications or anything like that. Hacking questions? Define a "hacking question" and we'll let you know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5read Studer's answer again and then you might understand my response.  I'm responding to Studer's answer, not the OP's question.


















At first I believed they'd add clutter but using [mac] for any Mac based questions, [iphone] for iPhone based questions, etc. will help users categorize the type of Apple question. My initial impressions was wrong but I still believe there will be a list of tags that should not be allowed. The ones I first gave are not them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you edit the question & title then? Sounds like a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Josh K: Toned down the suck!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+agreed.  I think [apple] is definitely useless as it's the basic premise of the site.  [mac], [osx], [iphone], etc, are very usefull.

https://webmasters.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/153/moderator-nominationsGuidelines


Use this thread. Each nomination should be a separate answer. Link the name to the user's profile so we can see their activity.
The nominee should indicate their acceptance by commenting on (or indeed editing) the answer.
Vote on users you feel will make http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/good Moderator candidates. Please be civil and respectful.


We are looking for members who are deeply engaged in the community development; members who:


Are currently a registered user in good standing.
Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.
Exhibit patience and fairness at all times in their questions, answers, and comments.
Lead by example, showing respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.
Want the responsibility. Moderators volunteer a lot of time and work. Its can be hugely rewarding experience but it isn't always a popularity contest.


Bonus points for:


Being the site proposer or heavily involved in the proposal process.
Members who referred a lot of followers/committees on Area 51.
Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).


These users will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as Moderators until the formal elections.

They will:


Have access to the tools to perform the duties of Moderation
Have access to a special chat room where they will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing with the Stack Exchange team
Drive the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.)
Help get publicity for their sites and organize their communities


Basically, they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything they can do to help this site succeed. They will act as a liaison — a job that "links" Stack Overflow with this community.

Moderators solve a basic scalability problem. The SE team can't be in each site, identifying the issues and helping each community grow. That's where Moderators come in; they make sure communities are enabled to solve these problems where they can and elicit help when necessary.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who should the moderators be?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't you think it's a little soon to ask that?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question will there when you need it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Chi va piano, va sano; chi va sano, va lontano.* : He who goes softly, goes safely; he who goes safely, goes far.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5how are moderators chosen?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: By the community.

Eventually, public elections will be held, and those (I believe) will be done as they are on the Stack Overflow sites: With actual voting, separate from the Q&A system.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@John Rudy: Thank you!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just submitted some heavy edits, mostly from [another excellent post](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/211/moderator-nominations). I still feel it is far too early to ask, however since it has been asked we might as well make it complete.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I removed the self-nomination line, but did not add anything specifically restricting it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: I don't see why you explicitly removed the invitation to self-nominate that every other system had.

I'll do my best to find suitable candidates.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Robert Cartaino: see the answer below where we were discussing self-nomination.

Probably should start a new topic though and get a consensus since now we have conflicting opinions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: *:"If you think it should be added back in..."* No, I'm good.

Subjective questions for better or worse help out the community as it gets started - often as a way for users to boost rep to start getting several users to the point where editing and what normally takes a higher reputation to use. However I find their usefulness extremely short lived - they often become too vague or too localized and of little use even a week later.

Yes, we should allow jail breaking questions, since the Library of Congress(?) has just opined that it's legal. 

Sure it voids your warrantee, but if the question is just about jail breaking (rather than say, jail breaking for the purpose of pirating videos or music), we should allow discussions and simply encourage responders to indicate what actions might void your warrantee, brick your device, etc.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. If it was still a legal grey area I'd say absolutely not, but since it's been deemed free and clear then I don't see why we shouldn't allow them. 

We should, however, smack down any questions that are clearly piracy-related (as we, assumedly, would do if an OS X-related question about piracy came up).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+agreed jaydles, +mostly agreed scottie... who defines what is and isn't a legal grey area?  piracy is obviously illegal.  Jailbreaking was not explicitly illegal (by way of law or legal precedent) before the LOC ruling, and is clearly legal now.  Piracy has been proven to be illegal by the courts on many occasions.  This relates directly to the hackintosh "discussion".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wait, so there's a grey area as to what exactly the other grey area is? Is the second grey area clearly defined at least?


















I think that if we have an [apple] tag, it will be used in a way that doesn't add any value.  Maybe we can use [apple inc] for questions related to the company.

[apple-inc] might indeed be better as it makes it clearer it's about the *company*. If we do keep the [apple] tag, it will certainly be used in completely superfluous ways (like [programming] on Stack Overflow).


















I think that if we have an https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appleapple tag, it will be used in a way that doesn't add any value.

I think that unless there is specifically a law or a legal precedent against installing OS  X on non-Apple hardware for personal use, there is no reason whatsoever to keep these questions off the site.  

However, if the question relates to the hardware more specifically than the software, I think it starts falling out of scope.  Take these two questions for example:


Q: When installing Snow Leopard on a PC, should I use the GUID partitioning scheme or MBR?
Q: What kext or injector should I use to get my NVIDIA xxxx card working in Snow Leopard on my Dell computer?


The first question is generally related to running Snow Leopard, and has little to do with non-Apple software or hardware.  The second question is really asking "How do I get x piece of hardware that is explicitly unsupported by Apple to work on my PC running OS X?"  While I don't agree that the second question is asking how to do something illegal, I just think it's outside the scope of the site.

I think making a blanket ban of OSX86 related questions is pretty over the top unless someone can provide some proof that these types of questions are either:


Completely disallowed on Stack Exchange by the owners
Related to acts that are either explicitly illegal or have been shown to be illegal by court precedent


If either of the above can be shown, then I would totally agree with a blanket ban...

I strongly disagree with casting a blanket ban.  The scope should just be limited IMHO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, pc users who decide to attempt installation of OS X on their machines can only lead to positive growth in the Apple community.  These users are smart and motivated, and they are learning a great deal about the internals of OS X by undertaking such an effort.  I don't see how turning away these users could be a benefit to the site or the community at large.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: Personally I agree with not allowing Hackintosh questions. The majority of the Hackintosh questions are how do I install Mac OS X on my [insert manufacturer and model number or virtualization product of choice]? They're neither helpful or are the users looking to learn about Mac OS X. I don't think we'll see a blanket ban in reality. Just anything explicitly asking how to make a Hackintosh and such should not be allowed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a good point and is much more relevant than discussing the legality of something that no one has ever been brought to court for.  The influx of dumb questions would be obnoxious.  However, I want to make sure that a well stated question that is relevant to the community should not be summarily dismissed simply because it happens that the poster is running OS X on hardware that Apple didn't intend it to run on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera For what it's worth I agree with your last comment entirely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chealion: SE isn't owned by the community, its owned by a commercial entitity and ultimately they will intervene with the communities decisions if something doesn't fit into their direction.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@gfr: Clarification: The data and most often the direction (on the sites themselves) is owned by the community. The community is what "makes" (content wise) the sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I second calavera. Questions should be judged on their individual merit, not by the fact if they suit Apple Inc (legal problems notwithstanding). Very specialized questions about computer models to hackintosh are not insightful the same way as the 100th question about everyones preferred iPhone app. But a lot can learned when you try to do things outside the way Apple wants you to tread.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ZOMG THANK YOU.  I was beginning to think I was the only one here who didn't assume that whatever Apple says should be taken with a kind of holy admiration :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A bit late to the draw here, but absolutely agree with you calavera - a good question is a good question, regardless of hardware or anything else. Thanks for fighting the good fight!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I support calavera, but I would like to see an official position from the SE owners regarding this. If they have guts they should state this clear. So far all I see it that calavera answer has 10+ points but the approved answer has only ~1.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@daviesgeek: read my response to your answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`I think that unless there is specifically a law or a legal precedent against installing OS X on non-Apple hardware for personal use` -  Except that there *is* specifically a law against installing OS X on non-Apple hardware, thanks to the non-circumvention clauses found in the DMCA and it's various international equivalents. Whether that's sufficient reason to not deal with Hackintosh questions, I'll stay out of, but 'it's not illegal' is not a good starting point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LessPop_MoreFizz Actually that only applies to builds that modify protected parts of the OS; if one does a vanilla install it should be legal. *from what I've read on pro-hackintosh sites granted

[Mac] strikes me as the single most superfluous tag. [OSX] while seemingly useless at a glance, is actually fairly useful for categorizing general system software questions that aren't specific to one version or another. Similarly, [Apple] makes perfect sense as a tag for questions about Apple, The Company, rather than Apple, The Subject - But if folks would rather that tag be [Apple, Inc.], I don't think that's a problem either.

Questions about Mac Hardware, should, for clarity, probably be tagged with the particular product line (i.e. [iMac], [PowerBook], [Mac Mini]), or category ([Notebook], [Desktop]). I can really only count on one hand the sort of questions that could generally be applied to all Macs across that sort of categorization scheme that would actually benefit from a tag of [Mac] and not something else entirely.

I agree with KeithB, [apple] is very vague to what it actually refers to in any given situation. [apple inc] is kinda strange, but still better. [mac] is related to hardware questions about all macs. We should of course have [macmini], [imac], etc. for different models. [osx] is regarding the operating system and it's built in functionality, excluding standalone applications like AddressBook, Safari, iCal etc.

As a side note, how about [snow-leopard], [tiger] etc? Is it better or worse than [osx 10.6], [osx 10.5]. And is it possible to alias tags? Like the aforementioned [tiger] <-> [osx 10.4].

See http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/tag-folksonomy-and-tag-synonyms/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion: No rep, and not in the top 20 or 100 upvotes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still prefer `[apple]` for the company. `[snow-leopard]` => `[10.6]` are good, though `[10.6]` should be synonymous with SL.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see [tag:imac] and [tag:mac-mini] but there are so many different types of each model, I don't find value in that level of detail.

I think that Yes, we should :

If we want to create a huge DB of questions, easily searchable with everything in one place, it is a good thing to have the most popular questions form other sites include here; having all in one site is a better idea.

Google will also soon index the site and this will attract here users from all around the web, so they will know it's the right place to ask questions and provide answers.

I think this would be great if we can provide one of the biggest Apple related questions site on the web.



BTW, something I don't know : can we simply add questions with their respective answers with one or two clicks or do we have to manually copy them ?

Also Google will index it and hit Apple.SE with a "duplicate content" mark, which will push it far down in rankings. If that is the goal it's not a good one.

Proper tagging for questions, use this to determine a baseline format for tags.

Mac OS X => [osx] for example. 

All tags should be lowercase, case doesn't matter. Dashes - are used instead of spaces, so [mac-mini]. That could also be just [mini] if we prefer. 

Propose tags, making sure to include a general description and why you feel this is the proper "tag" for this.

That is a OS X specific thing you're asking about, it's fine here. You're asking how to change what happens when you plug a device in. Same as changing what happens when putting a blank disk in. It's OS specific, you're running OS X, this is Apple.SE, sounds kosher to me.

Maybe [osx-apps] or [osx-application] ? I'm not sold on [windows-alternative] as I feel it's a bit generic, though so are the other two I mentioned.

If someone is asking for a software recommendation I guess it doesn't really matter whether they want an alternative to a windows app or something that just popped into their head.


















What about [software-recommendation] instead?

Of note, there used to be some concern over the length of the tag https://meta.superuser.com/questions/171/superuser-tagging-question-software-hardware-product-recommendationslast year - I'm not sure what lists Jeff is referring to.

Plus these kind of questions aren't what he wants to see on these sites... due to them being "list of x" type questions. He may rename the tag in the future, so just be warned. There are several threads about this on the meta.webapps.stackexchange.com site. [Here's one](http://meta.webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/54/should-rec-tags-be-added) to get you started.


















I nominate Chealion.  He/she (doesn't specify in their user profile, but I'll use he from here on out based on an educated statistical guess :) ) seems to be pretty open-minded, active, and easy-going.  He provides good answers, and doesn't seem to spam for points (most of his answers have been upvoted multiple times or accepted outright).  

He also makes good comments, and provides lots of votes, which I think is a good sign of someone who would make a great moderator.

I know I'm a bit late, but if you're concern about the length of the tag, why not try : 

[software-advice]       # I prefer this one.


OR

[software-suggestion]

I think if the super-super-user's like Jeff don't like the tag, they are obviously free to change it to whatever they like.  Personally I like the explicit nature of the software-recommendation tag, but if the powers that be want to change it, I'd rather they follow the superuser precedent and switch it back to software-rec.


















I feel that Apple software is pertinent. It runs on many devices and platforms, if you have an issue with Safari on XP that is applicable as it falls under the "Apple" umbrella.

I see there are several tags that are in a plural form but the singular form would also be acceptable and vice-versa, for examples :

software
shortcuts
applications
settings
bookmark

There is the same problem for infinitive verbs and the name derivates from this verb :

printing
networking
charging
mapping
sharing

As a guideline for the creation of new tags (and why not also edit the current ones) :
Do tags have to be in a plural or singular form ?
and
Do tags have to be in an infinitive verb or an -ing name ?

"softwares" would be wrong and "a-piece-of-software" would be silly; "software" is fine.


















I'm sorry for spamming the home page with retagging.

I highly approve this and I hope it isn't a hard-coded mechanism of stackexchange.

If this is the case, you should post your proposal on https://meta.stackexchange.com/Meta.SE.

I just wish it didn't affect the timestamps (or whatever) on the questions themselves. I'll have a look at the meta for StackOverflow (where I've spent most of my time) and see if this situation has been mentioned before - I'm sure it will have already been discussed. :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@robsoft - I hope you'll find an answer, because that would be really useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, Moderators can retag without causing the timestamps to change.


















Technically, I see Applications as a subset of Software, but that distinction is probably lost on most people.

While I am all for consistency, I wonder how useful these tags are. Most questions are going to be about either software or hardware. I think software-recommendation is a more meaningful tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's why I removed `software` where `software-recommendation` was already in place.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5agreed Studer, I did the same thing when I first added all the software-recommendation tags.


















In general, of-the-top-of-my-head fashion:


[osx] would need a wiki.
[apple] would need a wiki.
[mac] would need a wiki.


Actually, anything that is technically a proper noun should have a wiki. [firefox] for example, or [steve-jobs] perhaps? [iphone], [ios], [macbook] should have wikis.

By no means should they be insanely comprehensive though, just a couple of lines (or paragraphs as they prefer) describing the tag and applicable uses.

As we enter the second week of the public beta, we desperately need members from the site whose focus is to engage the community, both in community-building issues and site management. That's why we select a few members from each community to act as temporary, provisional Moderators. You can read about the program here: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/Moderators Pro Tempore.
I am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community’s issues are properly addressed:
   
Congrats to @Calavera for his late addition to the moderator team. Apple moderation needed some extra support so thank you for stepping up!
We want to make this site a huge success, and these members are great examples of exactly the type of people we need to make this site succeed. Please welcome them for the hard work and time they contribute.
Did I overlook anyone?
Almost certainly. There are members who are actively involved and very deserving of recognition. My failure to account for everyone this early on is in no way a slight against them. Ideally, Moderators are elected by the community and that's why you'll have your elections in several weeks.
Most of all, be respectful and understanding of the Moderators Pro Tem. Members of your community are volunteering their time and learning on the job. It’s a learning experience for everyone.

One Apple.SE we now have at least 13 list/poll style questions. These questions will always be "unanswered" and cause a bit of strife over how to deal with them as sites mature. Should we be allowing list style questions on Apple.SE?

Pros


Information that can not easily be gleaned from a Google search can be easily put together in a list (eg. Great shortcuts)
Tend to create a lot of views and bring a lot of attention than most other questions. (eg. Mac OS X Terminal Tips on Super User)
Very beginner friendly


A good example of a list doing well is the recent question https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1322/can-i-open-the-menu-with-keyboardCan I open the menu with the keyboard was answered quickly because of an answer put in the Mac OS X Keyboard Shortcuts question.

Cons


Seen as "Noise" - detract from more serious questions and are often updated keeping them on the front page
Value decreases significantly the more answers are provided
Often are time restricted (become stale quickly) - how much is it that bad questions are just rephrased as polls instead?


Possible Cons


Doesn't scale in terms of usage (few people will read the 2nd page)


A good example of a good list gone bad is the https://superuser.com/questions/52483/terminal-tips-and-tricks-for-mac-os-xMac OS X Terminal Tips & Tricks question on Super User. While quite useful once it got past one page it become increasingly useless as the level of noise in the question exceeded the signal (caused by spam, duplicates, new users, duplicates) and it was being constantly bumped to the front page.

Note: At present list questions are allowed as nothing has been decided on this (we've had a total ~4 people weigh in on this). Old list questions that have become unwieldy (read: not curated anymore for a long period of time) will be closed. The current list questions are in great shape! Thanks to everyone involved.

Some of them feel very redundant, with great games, quick look plugins, etc.


















Right, my basic opinion is this:

Polls are fine, as long as they are on-topic, clearly formulated and a couple of simple rules are in place.

Those simple rules would be something like:


One item (application, plugin, whatever) per answer
No duplicates
Uniform formatting (not as important, but it can make the whole thing more useful)


There's overwhelming evidence (e.g. in the form of hundreds of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-readupvotes) that people often find such poll questions useful, and they obviously help bringing in more users and attention (especially relevant to these beta sites).

"Cons" dissected

That said, let me offer some critical commentary on a couple of the "Cons" you mentioned. (These are things that people, starting from Jeff Atwood, seem to keep repeating even though what I've seen in practice at several SE sites doesn't necessarily support them at all...)


  Don't scale


Some truth to it, but not quite so. The fact is that SE software is not optimal for polls with hundreds of answers, but it still works. Nothing crashes; new answers can be added; good stuff still is at the top; bad stuff gets down to the bottom. How exactly does it not scale?

Sure, no-one reads https://superuser.com/questions/1191/what-are-some-must-have-mac-os-x-programsall of the 157 answers to a poll about OS X programs at one sitting. So what? It can still very useful, for example to a person new to OS X who goes through the first 2-3 pages and find plenty of great ideas of what to install!


  "Noise" - detract from more serious
  questions


This is probably the strongest argument of those four. Big polls keep popping up on the front page with new answers and edits. Still: it is quite easy to ignore questions you don't like (but others like very much) and move on with your life. If a tag such as [poll] is used, those who want can even hide them completely. 

Even then polls would affect how newcomers perceive the site, right? Well yes, but not in any untruthful way. Don't worry about it too much. People are generally smart and benevolent enough (which is why Stack Overflow works, by the way).


  Often are time restricted (become stale quickly)


Some people love to repeat this, but fortunately it is not true at all. Community wiki polls on SE can stay perfectly dynamic, alive and up-to-date. This can be achieved with some active pruning and a couple of key features in the software platform. These features are:


The voting system. Good stuff goes up, bad stuff (including duplicates and other worthless posts) goes down.
Ability to add new answers. 
Ability to edit answers (by any trusted users)  
Ability to delete answers 


People who posted duplicates usually did it unwittingly, and can often be persuaded to remove such zero-value-adding posts
Not as crucial, but still useful: moderators can prune away downvoted duplicates and other crap from the bottom, if they want to.

Ability to sort answers by votes and by date


A couple of use cases, with the https://superuser.com/questions/1191/what-are-some-must-have-mac-os-x-programsMac application poll as an example.

1) Let's say a new OS X app is released, 2 years after the poll was created. The app is absolutely fantastic. Someone goes on and adds an answer about it. Ok, it now has 0 votes and sits at the bottom. Does it get buried behind all the mediocre stuff? No. (Unless it deserves to.) Many knowledgeable users use the "newest" ordering when returning to look a poll question, and if they see good new stuff, they vote it up. If the new app truly is great, it will reach the first page in a few days or weeks, even if the poll has 6 to 8 pages of answers! 

If you don't believe me on that one, I can dig up evidence e.g. from some gigantic Stack Overflow poll; I've seen it happen often enough.

It's sort of sad to see those useful questions (some of the community's most-liked questions, actually!) on Super User https://meta.superuser.com/questions/915/should-this-popular-cw-question-be-unlocked-to-allow-it-to-evolvelocked because that is exactly what kills them and makes them stale (no new answers can be added).

2) Let's say a relatively highly-voted app (e.g. Google Chrome) gets a slew of new features, transforming the key essence of that app (say, Google engineers pushed the limits further and it does your laundry now). This affects people's opinions about the app, and our poll is suddenly all stale and obsolete, right? Well, no. Someone goes and edits the CW answer to mention this key fact. It gets votes from new users and moves higher in the list. Those who don't like the new version of the app can change their former upvote to downvote. (Ok, this Chrome example is suboptimal; maybe I'll come up with a better one later.)

Such adaptation to changed world will always take some time, but in the bigger scheme of things it doesn't matter. Like Wikipedia, these things can mostly be self-healing and self-updating if you just let them (i.e. don't lock them!) and if you do just a little bit of curating every now and then.

Examples of great poll questions

Finally, for reference and as examples, below are links to some good polls.


SF: https://serverfault.com/q/3780/1746Useful Command-line Commands on Windows – Nice showcase of a well-executed poll. 
Apple SE: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/400/150Mac OS X hidden features – I'm happy that http://twitter.com/spolsky/status/24493360648Joel seems to appreciate a good poll (and sees their value in promoting SE), even if https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/57226/56285Jeff is still against them almost categorically.
SU: https://superuser.com/q/1241/2984“Must have” Windows programs? – Shame that it's been https://meta.superuser.com/q/915/2984"killed" by locking it for no good reason at all. :-(
SO: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/101268/Hidden features of Python – Considered useful by many people, as you can see.


That last one boasts a new (to me, at least) feature:

The "protected" status seems like a great compromise. It can help in keeping dupes/spam at bay, but, unlike locking, lets the question stay "alive".

Someone to give a better view of why the poll is just fine. I still disagree but I can understand the upsides to poll questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Community wiki polls on SE **can** stay perfectly dynamic, alive and up-to-date." The reason I made sure the word 'Often' was at the start of that con point was because the majority of the time it's not the case (especially on non-SO sites).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion: Sure. I'm not arguing in favour of *any* polls either; only on-topic, well-pruned ones. (CW happily enables almost anyone to participate in pruning. And sometimes even what's initially a poor question might be turned into a useful one.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my view, one remaining problem might be "badge farming" (though I think hardly anyone really does that on purpose). In my opinion it would be great if CW posts wouldn't give you badges at all (excluding posts in non-poll questions that became CW automatically, through popularity). I don't know if such change to the platform has been suggested.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik: The current ones are doing exceptionally well. I still don't like them on principle but I can agree they are working.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this answer clarifies it a lot for me.  I've waffled back and forth just within the OS X Applications thread.  One minute I think the thread is great, like after someone posts something that is useful to me.  The next minute I'm annoyed because 4 straight answers are highly localized and totally useless to me.  But Jonik is right... I set the answer display to "newest", and I only have to see the last few that were posted.  I think I'm going to just start downvoting things that seem totally useless to most people.  Like if only 1 out of 10 people will care about it, it gets a downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: Personally I just *abstain from upvoting* if a poll answer doesn't seem useful to me, and reserve downvotes for duplicates (and spam, offtopic posts, etc). But do use votes as you see best! Thanks for feedback :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik: We can add the protect flags when necessary - any moderator is able to do that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik: well that's what I've been doing up till this point.  But in order to keep the thread "active" and "fresh", might as well add my personal opinion into the mix :)  however, I've barely done this at all, just apps that I either truly don't like or seem totally useless and are just wasting thread space.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unfortrunately, voting here doesn't really work in the long term. I've just reread answers on [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82/which-os-x-applications-do-you-find-indispensable), and some answers that I've previously upvoted, I'd like to downvote now, simply because my preferences have changed. Unfortunately I cannot do that, because my votes are too old. The end result for that specific question is that it reflects some point in the history, but is not reflecting today choices of people who voted two years ago.


















I think the new http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/announcer-booster-and-publicist-badges/permalinks and badges are a genius way of growing site traffic. My advice is to attempt to locate questions people are asking on other sites that have answers here and post a link to the answer here. This provides a non-spammy way of increasing the visibility of the site, increases the Google pagerank for our content, and provides the person on the other site with the answer to their question.

I notice that there is at least one question that has pasted a window of the Apple Crash reporter. However to find the cause it is often needed to see the whole crash log.

For Apple exchange should we be accepting questions that require this much information ie a paste of the crash log or this this too much detail and too specific?

I just didn't know if the crash logs were covered under the NDA as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Depending on the NDA and log: it's sometimes easy to see from a log that software is (or should be) subject to NDA.

Would it be allowed to mis-spell certain words to make a point? (I'm not talking about tags, were you absolutely need one authoritative spelling.) Should I be able to write about iDontWork when I'm complaining about iWork? What about Micro$oft?

We have a similar (but more narrow) discussion on the WordPress site, where (for the moment) one user (sometimes) prefers to write Wordpress instead of WordPress. Since this is the subject of our site, opinions are divided on https://wordpress.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/96/should-we-ask-for-reasonable-consistency-in-style-for-things-like-wordpress-vswhether we should allow this, or https://wordpress.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112/proposal-why-wordpress-or-wordpress-and-not-wordpress-campaign/138#138provide a way to signal the "protest" so others won't edit it away.

And indeed these things are petty, but edit wars are generally not about the important things...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, I get it now. I'd say no - it detracts from the question. On Super User I've edited questions that had these and never had an issue. There are other ways of making a point without annoying anyone who might actually answer your question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Same opinion as Chealion, we shouldn't allow these terms.


















I think we must encourage Superuser people who asks any question about apple to ask their quiestions in APPLE.SE.
we can do this by put comment on their question "this question more related to APPLE.SE"

According to http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/changes-to-stack-exchange/StackOverflow blog we just have 60 days left to graduates to full citizenship. and we must reach some point to fulfil that.


number of new questions per day
number of people who vote
number of registered users
percentage of answered questions


I suggest for solving number 1 and 2 that top user act more activity, I see top 35 user profile and see just 7 of them vote more than 70 time and just 1 person get "Civic Duty " badges.
and about 7 or more person asked 5 or above questions, we need more question per day.

and for attracting more new user I think "https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/90/list-of-x-poll-style-questions-what-to-dopoll-style-questions" will help us. they have more view than other questions.

With luck the Gadgets.SE questions will help draw more users here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Joel Spolsky, though, seems to be totally for using (good) poll questions to promote SE sites. Consider this tweet (which has already brought thousands of visitors here): http://twitter.com/spolsky/status/24493360648b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik: Should clarify; I disagree with making new poll questions. Obviously my opinion is clear - I don't like them but they do work but they really need to be kept clean like the ones we have are. I closed some from gadgets as they were examples of badly done poll questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chealion: I totally agree that we can be *picky* about any new polls, but I think (as you might guess by now :) that a strict "no new polls" policy is harmful. (Some interesting stuff will *probably* happen in the future too (e.g. completely new Apple products) and such rule would restrict too much.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik I think that's what will happen. :-)


















Just read the email that "the Gadgets Stack Exchange has been closed due to lack of traffic" and "Some of the questions which are appropriate to other Stack Exchange sites have already been migrated to these sites", including this one.

I didn't have an account on this site, so questions I wrote (e.g. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2149/after-market-car-stereos-with-ios-4-ipod-out-supportAfter market car stereos with iOS 4/iPod Out support?) aren't linked to my account, as well as up votes I received on that site didn't transfer.

Not sure of this is a bug, feature request or intended design, so I figured I would post a question here.

Not sure if mods can do it or if I need someone from the SO team to do it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've got half of that.  Looks like I've got a question associated with my account, though no rep from upvotes.


















One problem, in a way, in getting more people here, is that there already are popular Apple related sites and forums which have strong communities around them and (sometimes) are (tolerably) useful for finding information. Examples:


http://forums.macrumors.com/Forums at Mac Rumors — hugely popular
Example of a locally very popular forum: http://www.hopeinenomena.net/Hopeinen Omena (Finland)


Both are powered by traditional forum software which https://twitter.com/el_joni/status/24496056611totally sucks in https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/24498175151surfacing useful information but is good for creating communities.

For Q&A, the Stack Exchange platform is clearly superior. But currently the largest, most knowledgeable communities are still elsewhere. (That's why I had to wade through http://hopeinenomena.net/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=147117all those pages about iPhone 4 ordering on Hopeinen Omena; I wouldn't have got that information from here.)

So, we need to make users of those sites understand there's something better out there for Q&A. I'm not saying I know how to do that, but this is something we should consider. :-) Guerrilla marketing at such forums? (Edit: Kyle's https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/89/promoting-apple-se/93#93non-spammy approach of posting relevant links is even better!) Buying banner ads at Mac Rumors (if they allow it)? Other ideas?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's a great idea, we can find some unanswered question there and link them to asked same Question in Apple.SE or something like this.


















This should also be brought up at some point, so I'll do it now. :-) Does anyone have ideas about what visual elements our Apple SE should have?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our logo and site design be like?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So this is completely random, but I had a dream last night that Apple.SO had been outfitted with all the final graphics, and the logo was something that didn't even slightly resemble Apple. It was ugly and dull.


















Last month Apple.SE had 1k views/day on average but this week it has decreased to 500. Does anyone knows the reason?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why did Apple.SE visitors count drop so fast?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's back to ~1K...


















I suspect part of it is that it's currently the weekend - there is always a noticeable drop in views on Saturday and Sunday.

However the addition of all the gadgets questions has complicated matters:


  views_per_day there is the sum of all views (as determined by unique IP visits within a reasonable interval) on all questions (including deleted, closed, migrated, etc.) over the number of days the site has existed (as determined by the creation date of the oldest question).


Now that we have much older questions on Apple.SE we have 50 or 60 days at present of very, very few views that previously did not exist at all.

Source: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64863/how-is-views-day-calculatedHow is views/day calculated? on MSO as I believe they adjusted it over this past week.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice catch – migrating questions from Gadgets definitely accounts for a big part of the drop. Oh well, some more [promoting](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89/promoting-apple-se) needed :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of note, the migration of the questions resulted in Apple.SE dropping from 1k to ~513. Whereas Android starts off at a paltry 79 views/day because of it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5then what we can do to increase it again? must report to development team or something else?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Am1rr3zA Just get more visitors and eventually over time the "penalty" will lessen.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem has been fixed! See the linked MSO question for details on how "views per day" is now calculated.


















I have a feeling this will be somewhat controversial, but to be perfectly frank it seems like the Apple.SE site and the community that was forming around it was quite OS X centered.  Now with the huge influx of iOS related questions, the site seems disjointed and less focused. 

Personal opinion: A lot of OS X users don't have much interest in iphone or ipod, and generally ignore these questions, but it's hard when so many are suddenly about these devices.

Why did the sites need to be merged in the first place? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was the gadgets site merged into this one?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for wondering about merging OSX and iOS! I have an iPhone but no Mac. In my view, the iOS questions kind of drown in the OSX "noise" here. `OSX != iOS` !


















I believe there wasn’t much activity going on on Gadgets anyway and most were iPhones/iPods/iPads.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A lot (most?) of the questions were about Apple gear and Android gear. (Obviously, only *Apple questions* were merged here.) Reasons why they decided to close it are [detailed in the blog](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik: your comment is really the true answer to this question :)


















I think it was a pretty logical thing to do to migrate iPhone, iPad, and other Apple gadget questions here after the Gadgets site was http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/closed. Why? This is the only SE site where they are on-topic.

If we go back and look at the http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/151?phase=definitionApple site proposal at Area 51, there is nothing there that defines this site as "OS X only" or "OS X mostly" (although it is true that the top on-topic examples are Mac/OS X ones). (Also, if Apple SE actually was "Mac / OS X only", that would mean there was no need for it in the first place, as Mac and OS X are perfectly on-topic at https://superuser.com/Super User.)

If you consider http://stackoverflow.comStack Overflow, is it becoming "disjointed" with the huge influx of questions on Ruby or Python that the average C# programmer really doesn't have much interest in? By the way, http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/Spolsky discusses the SE scope issue in the latest blog entry; interesting read.

Bottom line: if you don't care much about iOS related questions, you can easily ignore them. (You can tweak your prefs so that you don't even see those questions, if you want to.) I don't think merging in those questions does harm to the community, at least in the long run.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I 100% agree with you :D


















I've been working on the tag list lately, trying to standardize the format and clean up confusion. For instance, we didn't need both https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/podcast[podcast] and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/podcasts[podcasts], and the non-existent https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-2g[iphone-2g] needed to be redirected to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-3g[iphone-3g].

So far, so good… mostly.

The internal editor in my head says https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applications[applications] run on my Mac, and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apps[apps] run on my iPhone and iPad (and yes, I know the [applications] tag is currently unused).

Consequently a couple of days ago, on the question https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2377/ipad-getting-back-to-initial-screen-after-watching-podcastiPad: getting back to initial screen after watching podcast, I changed the tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipod-application[ipod-application] to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipod-app[ipod-app] and set the former to be a synonym of the latter.

Today, https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/481/nippysaurusNippysaurus changed it back again.

This wouldn't be an issue except the system still thinks [ipod-application] is a synonym of [ipod-app] — which means you now can't get to its https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ipod-application/infoinfo, https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ipod-application/faqfaq, https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ipod-application/statsstats, https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ipod-application/newnew answers, or https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ipod-application/synonymsynonym pages.

I'm about to rollback his change and see if that fixes the problems, but I figured that this—and tag standardization in general—could use a discussion.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag standardizationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My tags are awesome! :pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For link purposes: [Tag corrections — Ask Different Meta](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/49/8546)


















Nice work on cleaning tags. As for [iphone-2g] being a synonym - the iPhone 2G is sometimes how the original iPhone is referred to (2G referring to EDGE) instead of the 2nd generation like the iPod lines tend to use.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: I'd let it be and end up approaching them on a case by case basis. The good news is that it isn't made anymore so we shouldn't see many questions dealing with it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point on "iphone-2g". My feeling is that people usually mean the **original iPhone** (launched 2007) with that, not iPhone 3G.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Without voting on this answer: we already have both [tag:ipod] ([info](http://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ipod/info)) and [tag:apps] ([info](http://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/apps/info)) so I do not favour the idea of [tag:ipod-app].b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GrahamPerrin: Given this answer's age. I'm inclined to agree.


















One minor suggestion: retag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios4ios4 to ios-4. That would be more consistent with tags like iphone-3g and http://www.apple.com/iphone/ios4/more correct too.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I vote for the change for the sake of consistent use of the hyphen as a space. See my comment on `[mac-mini]` vs. `[macmini]`


















I don't know the exact SE policy about tag but I prefer some shorter synonym for some tag for example I hate https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/software-recommendation[software-recommendation] I think it's too long and I prefer https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/software-recsoftware-rec (as it use in http://superuser.comsuperuser). in the beginning I try to change all to software-rec but someone focus on  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/software-recommendation[software-recommendation] and I tired of editing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58/tag-for-alternatives-to-windows-only-applications Both tags appeared around the same time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags aren't variables in code; the context of the question is given to us largely by the tag if no other information is in the question itself. The abbreviation "rec" can have all sorts of meanings, the least of which being "recommendation". If the tag doesn't give us the context of the question, then a lot of intent can be lost.




















The Startups SE is simply using the power button symbol, and that's where I got the idea to use the ubiquitous cloverleaf. Keep it a solid color, either the black that trims our iPads and iPhones, or the gray color that is the Apple logo on startup in Mac OS X, and it will work in any format.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For those who didn't know, some further info about the symbol: [Saint John's Arms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John's_Arms)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Apple Logo  [may not be used](http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html) [except pursuant to an express written trademark license from Apple](http://diigo.com/0iqub). **⌘** might be not visible in some other Apple products and services, but next to  I believe that **⌘** *is* the **second most widely recognisable symbol** of *an Apple device*. Many such devices are used with Mac hardware — [NumberKey](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/numberkey/id291672903) is a more exotic example; most associations between Mac and non-Mac devices are subliminal. I vote **⌘**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Found this discussion because I was wondering why this unused symbol is still the logo of this blog. I think Apple isn't using it anymore since 2007/2008. So it will disappear. So maybe we should look for another one...


















You may be falling on the wrong side of when the server rolls over between days - the day changes at midnight GMT (10 AM in Brisbane, 8 PM EST) so if you don't visit between 10 AM today and 10 AM tomorrow you won't have visited for 24 hours despite having visited once each day (eg. 9:30 AM today and say noon tomorrow).

We closed the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9/domain-name-suggestionsdomain naming thread (click for details).
Instead, let's start with a killer "elevator pitch!" Joel will be blogging about the elevator pitch approach to naming, but to get you started:
The Elevator Pitch
This isn't as easy as it sounds. Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. Make every... word... count.
Here are some creative examples:

http://gawker.com/Gawker: Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe.
http://gizmodo.com/Gizmodo: The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural.
http://www.autoblog.com/Autoblog: We obsessively cover the auto industry.
http://www.dumblittleman.com/DumbLittleMan: So what do we do here? Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane.
http://www.needcoffee.com/Needcoffee.com: We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm…whipped cream.

Use it as a Tagline
A shorter elevator pitch can be used as a tagline — something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples:

http://slashdot.org/Slashdot: News for nerds. Stuff that matters.
http://www.lifehacker.com/Lifehacker: Don’t live to geek, geek to live!
http://www.thesimpledollar.com/The Simple Dollar: Financial talk for the rest of us.

The Motto (don't forget https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107/what-should-our-logo-and-site-design-be-likeyour logo)
A logo begs for it own little, short tagline — like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it:

Just do it.
Think Different.
The Uncola.
Intel inside.
Like a rock.
The king of beers.

…and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site… eventually. So let's start from the basics. Come up with a killer elevator pitch, tagline, and/or motto!

FYI I did the wikipedia "be bold" thing and created two new tags:
[unibody]: for questions that that aren't specific to the MB or MBP, but encompass both versions if they are in unibody cases.
[notebook]: for questions that encompass all Apple portable computers with a physical keyboard (i.e. no iPads, iPod Touch, iPhone... just MBP, MB, PowerBooks, etc).
edit @Dori:
Why are you rolling back these changes without any discussion?  You haven't posted on here why you think the tags should be kept as is.  So far there is no opposition, and the tags you reverted to are not descriptive of the topic elements in the questions.
in regards to these particular tags:
this is obviously open to discussion, so feel free to post your preferred alternative and hopefully some votes can help us reach a consensus. I just created the tags to get the train rolling, but they can be edited if there is a better option

But whatever. With regards to rollbacks, **I agree**. Perhaps leave the original tag (e.g. `macbook`) too, but removing `notebook` without justification is just silly. :(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik: this is obviously open to discussion, so feel free to post laptop as your preferred alternative and hopefully some votes can help us reach a consensus.  I just created the tags to get the train rolling, but they can be edited if there is a better option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: not a problem, I just did not know if you had even seen this topic so I didn't know how to get your attention :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5however... maybe next time you could post *before* you go through and roll back all the changes?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: How are they not applicable??  I left the macbook tags and added tags that more correctly specified the nature of the question... I don't see any reason why you would remove tags that describe the question.  The tags that you are reverting to are the ones that "aren't necessarily applicable", but as you state yourself in your answer, they make the questions more easily search-able.  So I agreed with you on that point and kept those tags and added more specificity and that's bad??b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: it doesn't apply to all optical-drives or all enclosures either, but you aren't removing those.  It applies most specifically to unibody macbook and macbook pros.  Like your previous logic regarding macbooks, most people that see "unibody" are going to think macbook or macbook pro, very rarely would anyone assume it refers to the macbook air.  As I said in my response to your other comment, I don't care if unibody is not the absolute 100% best tag... but come up with something better rather than removing it since it certainly is applicable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: This was a hot-headed response, and I apologize for not giving myself and hour or so before responding :)  *extends olive brand*


















How about using [laptop] for those questions? (I'm adding this as an alternative as calavera suggested.)

See what http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_%28computer%29Wikipedia prefers. ;-)

Edit: With the above I meant not using two categories like [unibody] & [notebook]. I am not suggesting that any original [macbook] etc. tags should be removed, if that's what some downvoter thought.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ok, now that you brought the wikipedia thing into it, I agree laptop is better :P  I still think there should be a unibody tag though, since people ask questions about hardware that only applies to unibody MacBook and MacBook Pros.  Like the optical drive replacement stuff, as far as I know, those products will only fit in unibodies.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5so come up with a better descriptor and propose it rather than blowing away a helpful addition.  it sure as heck doesn't work for all macbook pros or macbooks either, so your own logic is working against you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apple refers to them as [portable] since many are too warm to run comfortably on a lap anymore.

Community Wiki posts are questions/answers that are now owned by the community - votes up or down do not affect the original user's reputation. They are also editable by more users (only requires 100 reputation instead of 1000). The primary goal is to allow a question or a question to be easily updated by everyone involved.

For all the details check out the faq question on MSO: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-postsWhat are "Community Wiki" posts?

This is a volunteer gig for everyone, so other priorites come first (I'm only here while the Blue Bar of Time is running across my screen, which happens to be a lot). I just disagree with the policy change because I thought the community was policing itself just fine, and moderators have more important issues to deal with than marking clearly subjective posts as community wiki. Bad tactical decision on the part of SE, AFAIC.


















It's unclear what you are referring to here.

If you mean your reputation on meta, that is synced hourly between parent and child meta. Votes here on meta do NOT affect reputation in any way.

If you mean your reputation on the parent site, I'm not aware of any bugs that would prevent reputation from working as normal.

I don't want to create any kind of poo-storm, but I would like to see more hands-off moderation, at least in these early stages of the site.  

A lot of the users on this site are brand-new, and they will not continue to post or frequent it if their questions are closed, answers are brushed off, or their questions are completely rewritten.  I'm not saying we shouldn't strive for high-quality, just that I would like it if we could keep our standards a little more loose and our comments a little more positive at least until the site really takes off.

FYI: I'm not singling anybody out and I know I've been guilty of heavy-handed moderation as well.  This is directed towards all of of us... from those with the privileges of commenting and voting-down all the way to those with the full use of moderator tools.

Can you name some examples of what you mean? I know you don't want to call anyone out, but if you could lay out some general hypothetical scenarios it would be helpful to know.

I do, however, agree with what you've said - to a point. It's important to make sure that we don't generate traffic at the expense of the quality of the site, but as long as someone's making an earnest effort at contributing and not being disruptive moderation should be relatively hands-off.

If you want the site to do better: ask more question!

Specifically, ask more questions you mom would have when using a Mac or somebody coming from Windows, as they are likely to have lots of questions!

Since this is a poo-storm I will add my two cents. 

I believe that macbook or macbookpro should be there, as much as macbookair (if it exists), a tag synonym should encompass the same models (i.e. unibody, etc.)

The truth is that tags are nice, but if you go tooooooo specific, it turns against you. If I have a macbook pro 17’’ problem, I don’t think that the (in)existence of that tag would prevent me to find it. I’ll just search macbook pro 17’’ etc. 

Apple Laptops are called macbook, macbook pro and macbook air. That’s all you need in my humble opinion. Of course Powerbook should be there too, but old models will definitely get less questions. 

All other variants (size, etc.) should be grouped into synonyms. 

And Unibody stuff?
Unibody should be its own tags. Mac-minis are unibodies too, so that’s an additional and distinctive feature of a particular model. There are Macbook Pros and Unibody Macbook Pros. The tag should exist as such. 

In my opinion, (to repeat myself) the current Apple models (macbooks) are more or less the same and a problem that exists on a Macbook Pro 15’’ will probably be the same on a 17’’ model and if not, my idea is that Tags are not the right tool to differentiate that particular aspect of the question.

I think it's a relevant subset of hardware model.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for unibody from the standpoint of a hardware repair technician - see the wikipedia article on macbooks for details how much different non-unibody versus unibody hardware is. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbook

I don't own a Mac, but I do own an iPhone. 

Frankly, I dislike that my iPhone questions get drowned in so much Mac "noise". I preferred to have iPhone questions in the now-closed "gadgets" site because it made so much more sense to discuss smartphones in one place (there) and computers in another (here), but the decision was made. Smartphone questions are also being posted on SuperUser but only some of them are closed by the moderators - this inconsistency disturbs me.

Given that this Mac site exists, I also dislike that there are so many Mac questions over at SuperUser. Those aren't getting closed. That's another inconsistency that disturbs me. 

Things are too muddy this way.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 No interest in Mac stuff either, but only iPhone/iTunes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a disturbance in the force.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I hardly think that iPhone questions are drowned - 'iphone' is the top tag on the site by a wide margin, and 'ipad', 'itunes', and 'ipod-touch' are the 3rd, 4th, and 5th most used tags. I will agree that by having two places to ask Mac question (here and SuperUser) it can get a little muddy, I still think that it can work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Smartphone questions unless they directly relate to a computer don't belong on Super User. If you want to ignore the Mac stuff, just put mac and osx on your ignored tags. I've always been more worried about low quality iPhone noise (that thankfully has never materialized).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@torbengb, @BJQ: As for the "Mac noise", use ignored tags as Chealion said. If you don't want to see those questions *at all*, check the **Hide Ignored Tags** option in your prefs. I don't like the Super User inconstancies either; for now I'm personally posting all questions that fit on the Apple to the Apple site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, the ignore tags are useful, and I use them. However, I'd really need a "not-tag", i.e. hide everything that's NOT tagged iPhone or iOS. Otherwise I'd have to put every conceivable tag on my ignore list except those tags that are relevant for the iPhone. And then check hide-ignored.


















iOS and Mac OS are pretty different.  I find this community far superior to the other ones online, simply because of the lack of reverence for the platform.  I get good data here, as if Apple made tools, albeit damn good ones, as opposed to being gifts from on high.  IPhones might have a lot of questions, but there are far fewer answers, since you are to use them "in ignorance, by sufferance".   I think it's good data. and moreover, if ubuntu has it's own stackexchange, then so should Apple.  More of a need in fact, this is a closed source unix variant.  You'd think you could just ask, but... taking a look at the lost souls howling their questions into the icy void on the apple forums, with threads marked "closed but no solution"...  There is a future here. 

What happens if this gets shut down?  Can we have our answers?

One of the issues I have with the Q&A so far is how much conjecture is thrown around.  Look at how many Answers start with phrases like "I think",  "I would think",  "I would guess" on Questions that are clearly not subjective.  How do you motivate people to include references or actual data in their Answers?

Final Update: Now that we've launched, I wanted to update this post with our final numbers:



Many thanks to everyone who helped make the site a success!



Update 4: We just crossed over 15 questions per day and are now up to 4 "excellents":



Also of note is the significant increase in our visits/day from 2,474 to 3,648.



Update 3: We're back to 3 "excellents" as Studer is now the 5th user to pass 3k rep:



Also, there was some confusion in the last update about the "questions per day" metric that has since been resolved - it's not over the entire beta of the site but of the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/73217/bug-in-area-51s-questions-per-day/73245#73245previous two week period. This will make it easier to improve - we only need ~35 more questions per week to be over the 15 q/d mark.

Finally, the answer ratio has seen a slight increase. My best guess is that the migration of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5435/terminal-tips-and-tricks-for-mac-os-xthis 97-answer question from Super User is what caused it.



Update 2: The "questions" metric has been changed to "questions per day". As such, we've now dropped from 3 "excellents" back down to 2:



We are only 1 3k+ rep user away from an "excellent" users rating, so hopefully if we keep voting we'll claw back to 3 "excellents".

Turning back to the questions per day, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/73217/bug-in-area-51s-questions-per-daythe number actually seems flat out wrong. According to Area 51, we've been in beta for 129 days, which would mean that we have ~1303 questions. However, the "Site Stats" box on our site indicates that we have 1648 questions. Either there's a bug, or there has been a change in what questions contribute towards that figure.

Assuming there's a bug, though, we still only have 12.8 questions per day, so we still need to get that ramped up - we're about 300 questions short right now.



Update: We've passed 1500 questions and are now at 3 "excellents":



Also of note, we've crossed over 2k visits/day and we have 38 more users with 200+ rep and 2 more users with 2k+ rep. We still need:


5 more users with 200+ rep
3 more with 2k+ rep
4 more with 3k+ rep


as well as increasing our answer ratio to 2.5 answers per question.



As many of you probably know, Area 51 has a set of metrics it uses to evaluate the progress of the sites in public beta:



We've always had an "excellent" percent answered, and as you can see we've recently crossed the 1500 visits/day "excellent" threshold as well. Now I'd like to see what we can do to address the rest of the metrics to bring them up to "excellent":


Number of questions should be pretty easy - at the current rate, we should hit 1500 questions in a little over a week.
Number of "avid users" is going to be harder. In order to get "excellent" in this category, we need to have 42 additional users with 200+ rep, 5 additional with 2,000+ rep, and 4 more with 5,000+ rep. To hit these targets, we'll need to


Actively recruit more users to the site. Suggestions about how to do this are welcome.
Questions, and especially answers, need to get more votes to increase the rep of the poster. We need to actively promote upvoting good questions and answers.

Answer ratio could also be tricky. In order to bring our existing question base up to a ratio of 2.5 answers per question we'd have to add over 420 answers (give or take, the ratio isn't precise). Of course, getting some answers to the 6% "unanswered" questions should be the top priority, but we should try to encourage users to add alternative solutions to "answered" questions as well.

I think the current planned launch order is [programmers, money, then RPG](http://meta.money.stackexchange.com/questions/180/any-idea-when-this-site-will-come-out-of-beta) (for some reason) but I think we're a good candidate to be the next one after those.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle Since SE’s designer is an Apple Boy, at least this will look nice on Safari :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle: i read in one of the chat rooms that they order it goes by is which communities have enough 3k plus users so that the site can be effectively self moderated.  After that it goes by excellent, good, worrying, etc, as far as stats are concerned.  So I think we're pretty good on the stats, but not so good on the community moderation aspect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera OK, that makes some sense. It was a bit confusing to me that some sites with less than half our # of questions and visits were scheduled to launch before us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle: strange timing for us to be talking about this... see Jin's new post on meta!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera w00t!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle Link or it didn’t happen! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Martin I got that info from [here](http://meta.money.stackexchange.com/questions/180/any-idea-when-this-site-will-come-out-of-beta), but I suspect that we're actually next in line after RPG as the other sites mentioned don't have any meta posts from Jinb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori OK, I updated to include the new info. I still think it's a good idea to get us in the best shape possible until we actually do launch, as the SE team constantly rechecks the stats and reorders the launch dates of the sites.


















Lurking around discussions.apple.com and posting “links” to this site might help. I did that with a couple of questions that had an answer here. :)

Different people use different terminology and symbols for Mac keys/commands. I figured we should have one standardized list that can be a point of reference for editing guidelines.
In general, the site should follow Apple’s Style Guide and the macOS Human Interface Guidelines to avoid confusion:

https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/
https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/keyboard/https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/keyboard/

Usage:

Names go from most to least common, so use the first in the list whenever possible.
Terms in italics are obsolete, slang, and/or terms used on other platforms; these should only be used when it's unavoidable.
No images were used here so that the symbols can be copied/pasted into questions and answers (and please do!).
When typing shortcuts, don't include characters that aren't pressed. In Safari, for instance, ⌘+ zooms in while ⌘- zooms out. Using ⌘++ or ⌘-+ would just be confusing.
The <kbd> tag is problematic: for instance, ⌘+ is readable, but ⌘⇥ is not.
Bolding shortcuts helps readability, but not inside <kbd> tags.

**⌘+** becomes ⌘+
**⌘⇥** becomes ⌘⇥
<kbd>**⌘+**</kbd> becomes ⌘+
<kbd>**⌘⇥**</kbd> becomes ⌘⇥


When typing shortcuts, don't separate keystrokes that must be made together. For instance, typing in  ⌥ N N or ⌥N N  produce different results—and the latter makes it clear which two need to be pressed simultaneously.

If you're using the <kbd> tag, that means use ⌥N N, not ⌥ N N.

Notes:

I'm not crazy about the way this looks either, but there's a limit to what I can do without tables and formatting. If you can improve it, please do!
This is currently solely based on the American English keyboard, so it could really use some internationalization help.

I'm not sure if it contributes to our site stats, but one possible way to increase our answer / question ratio would be to delete some of the closed questions that have no useful answers.  Even if it doesn't help the ratio it would be nice for overall site cohesiveness.
I've cast some delete votes and I hope that my fellow mod-tool priviligees will follow suit :)

Is there something StackExchange can develop to make this easier? Some tag/macro they can develop in order to sanely enter these characters? I like having a source, which this post is perfect for, but I like something more that doesn't unfocus me from the question/answer at hand.

This seems like a lot of extra hassle for essentially no tangible gain.  Unlike, say, Math Overflow, math.SE, or LaTeX.SE, symbolic notation here is simply beyond unnecessary (I refuse to say something so trite as "in my opinion", but given the recent allegations that I use "weasel words", this is a reverse disclaimer, in that these views are my own and not the views of "people in general", as it were.). This is a Q&A site for enthusiasts/power users of a certain brand of electronic device.  In fact, this kind of thing gives one (by which I mean your humble servant) the impression of "trying too hard", as it were.  

Further, albeit less related to the original post, it seems clear to me, at least, that this site would do well to drop the overwhelming aura of seriousness. Being an Apple fan, power user (alas, gone are the days when the users of the powermac/book quite literally "power users"), simply does not require that we speak and act with such gravity (as opposed to levity!). This is a Q&A site about the products of Apple Computer for experienced users. Lobotomizing away the personality and panache from people's posts (alliteration not intended) does not make the subject matter any more substantial or important.

Thank you for your time.

Cordially yours,

Harry
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The symbolic notation for keyboard shortcuts is widely used in Mac OS X - just open up the menu in any program - so it makes perfect sense to use it here as well. As far as "lobotomizing" the "personality" and "panache" from your posts, it's standard practice on the Stack Exchange network to remove unnecessary editorialization from anyone's posts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dear @Kyle, are you trying to run a Q&A site or compile an encyclopedia? I understand things like "remove unnecessary swearing", but editorializing includes the following example: (I'll do it in programming-speak for your entertainment, so you can chuckle at how little I know about programming):  Suppose someone asks a specific question, like, "Hey, store ints as floats?"  Then the answer would be something like "yes, here's how you do it". And editorializing would be, "and here's why you shouldn't".  Further, when I write, I write as "I, the author".  It's rather clear when you look at myb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5posts what is my opinion and what is general opinion.  There is a general way of writing mathematics (I think that it comes from the French), where one uses "we", as in, I the writer, and you the reader.  Is this the "editorializing that you're so against?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's more phrases like *"Every self-respecting Macintosh user knows that in terms of usability, the dock, while pretty, is even worse than the Micro$oft Windblows taskbar."* and *"Because I'm such a nice guy, I'm not going to rag on the OS X developers for the following completely inane design decision"* that are unnecessary. And yes, one of the goals behind Stack Exchange is a bit encyclopedic in that the questions and answers are intended to be useful both to the original asker and additionally to people coming in off Google with the same question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle: The second one doesn't even resemble editorializing at least for the definitions of editorializing I've found.  It does not assert that the opinions are held by anyone other than myself.  Further, it's clearly a joke since it very blatantly contradicts itself.  It's like saying, "I'm not trying to be mean or anything, I just want to see you shed _one_ tear." or "I'd _never_ hit a woman, but just last week, my wife started nagging me while I was watching the game, so I punched her in the uterus to shut her up".


















Oh yes this is readable - NOT!


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's supposed to look like [this](http://modos.org/mackeys.png). It's OK on Macs and iOS devices because they have fonts that can display the characters built in, but unfortunately it'll look broken on Windows. Not an ideal situation, but since the keyboard shortcuts are only useful to those that *have* Macs, it might be acceptable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori It supports Unicode, it just doesn't have any fonts that have the required characters. I think most of the symbols are custom-made by Apple and wouldn't be expected to be supported on other platforms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dori: it's really incomprehensible... i've had a little unknown character symbol next to the name of every person in my contact list who sends me an email in gmail since windows xp.  It's a standard unicode character that looks like a telephone icon.  The first time i get on a macbook, lo and behold, the character shows up just fine!  I'm not sure how unicode support is still a problem in Windows after all these years.  Not sure, but I think it's more a problem with the default fonts used by browsers in windows rather than lack of unicode compatible fonts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin All characters currently listed in the question are standard Unicode characters. (Not private use area characters with a special meaning in some fonts like the Apple logo character.)


















Hi all. I have some exciting news to share. A design for the official Apple.se site is in the works!

I need to ask the community what the final text in the header logo should be. Right now it's just "Apple." I feel it's a bit incomplete. Would "Apple Q&A" make more sense?

I'm open for suggestions. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Official Site Titleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have some suggestion for accepted answer put green apple on it in your design :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5woot!  great news!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just curious, how many sites are scheduled to launch before us?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kyle 1 or 2. However we re-evalute the stats of each Beta site every week, so the launch order is subject to change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori, thanks! I have seen the logo thread. I think since Apple dropped the rainbow colors in 1998, it may not reflect of Apple of today. Also for SE site logos, we don't need to make it look like the SE logo. I think the ⌘ symbol may be more fitting. It has an interesting backstory too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key#The_origin_of_.22.E2.8C.98.22b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori What would be bad about using ⌘? I don't think people are going to refer to it by name, so it shouldn't matter if there are multiple names for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dori but hasn't the rainbow apple icon been obsolete for a solid decade now? Also, we're looking for something people in that community will recognize, like a secret handshake. The words "Stack Overflow", for example, are meaningless to the 99.9% of people who aren't programmers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dori: I've stayed out of this debate since my suggestion of ⌘ until now, but the reason why I didn't vote for the rainbow logo is for exactly the first reason that @Jeff states. I love my collection of OS 9 and earlier Macs, but those days are long gone. The reason why I suggested ⌘ is because it has been on every Mac since the first, the Mac is a cornerstone of Apple's product line (we can't develop for the iOS properly without a Mac), and it is still on the keyboard today; ⌘ has outlasted the rainbow-themed logo.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oops, it seems I did vote for a rainbow logo, the one currently with four votes. Personally, I'm fine with whatever the community decides here. All of the designs are great so far (Programmers.SE is my current favorite of the sites I visit), so I'm sure whatever is done will look just fine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After having thought of this a bit more, I have to say I'm stumped.  Not to state the plainly obvious, if we use , we will incur the wrath of Apple's legal eagles. If we use the spectrum, probably not so much, but I don't think it really says "Apple" like it used to; the logo has always been really about the silhouette, I've always thought. Also, I thought one of the requirements was to have something that would work in one color as well, and in that case the spectrum simply won't work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If memory serves ⌘ has outlasted every icon in Apple's existence, and has only recently *not* been included in Apple products on such a large scale. I'm sure if used in a context with Apple, we still run the same low risk, but still a risk, as the spectrum. I don't recall there being other "branded" SE site like this one, but I'd be curious to know how this scenario has been handled if there is one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do not think, however, that having ⌘ as the logo will cause the site to narrow its focus to just the Macintosh line, especially if we use "Apple" somewhere in the *by-line* for the site (i.e., "Ask Different: Apple Q&A For The Rest Of Us" (hey, I kind of like that)), then that would fall into the fair use clause of copyright, and it makes it clear to all newcomers that this is for Apple questions and not just Macs (though I think that if we did actually narrow the focus people would ask whatever they wanted anyway).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: It seems to me that the crux of the problem is that there are no longer really any icons in the Apple "iconosphere" that are ① universal to all products outside of  ② that also make sense for a Q&A site and ③ won't get us into possible legal mires. There are odd bits like System Preferences and Apple applications like iTunes that reach across the two OSes, but that's it. I don't think ⌘ is perfect either, but we have little else to go on. As for the downvoting, you really ought to consider the source (when you can) in that particular case. That is a great cheat sheet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: One more thing, the spectrum logo I did vote for in the other thread was the one that made a whole icon as opposed to stripes (the one that's most popular) solely for the reason that in one color, the striped one would look exactly like the SE family logo, and adding in the  to compensate for that is out of the question (I think we would both agree).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is why I stopped being a graphic designer. Programming is so much easier than this!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: reading this thread I was thinking of the preferences gears as well...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dori: also, try not to take it personal, you also got **8** upvotes for that post including mine :)  everyone isn't always going to agree or even be nice, but it is the internet after all... that parts probably never going to change :)  At least you don't have an entire meta post dedicated to what a jerk you are like I do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori and others, I've enjoyed this debate. I think looking at the site design as a whole package, it needs to emote and reflect the theme of the site. The level of graphical details depends on the site's nature. Gaming has more, and Statistics has less. I try to find that fine balance. I want new users who come to the site to get "this is an Apple" site right away and veteran users enjoy the design as they provide valuable content. The logo is only part of this whole package. We all agree that we can't use , even a variation of it may get us in legal trouble. that's why I think ⌘ is [...]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[...] the next most recognizable symbol. Speaking of the design, occasionally I ask my respected designer friends to help out. The English site turned out great. For the Apple site, I've asked Mike Rundle of http://flyosity.com I feel he's more qualified to do the site than I. We talked about the creative direction, we both agreed it needs to reflect the Apple theme clearly, though may not explicitly copy all the Apple design elements. I'm very confident that he'll come up with a great design. I'll post it as soon as I receive it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin,@Dori,@Phillip: i posted my horrid idea over on the logo thread, try not to be too harsh :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"I've asked Mike Rundle of flyosity.com". That's *awesome*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Any updates?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle I will receive the design after the New Year, aiming to launch the site first week of Jan.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Great, looking forward to it. I saw the Unix site design and was getting a little jealous ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin I hate to keep bugging you, but the first week in Jan is almost over. Has there been a delay?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle bug me anytime! :) I talked to the designer yesterday. he's fine tuning some last min changes will have the design for me tomorrow. I'll post it as soon as I get it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Thanks for the update - I was going a little stir-crazy checking Meta for updates :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kyle I'm just as anxious as you areb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kyle btw, have you used SE tagset? http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/tag-sets-on-stack-exchange/ setup tag keywords and sites, so you can keep track of things without visiting the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin I have, but one of the things I was checking was to see when the last time you or Mike visited Meta.Apple :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Just FYI, there's a [feature request for a chat info box on the front page](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253/chat-status-on-landing-page-of-apple-se). Any chance you can squeeze it in?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin: I'm not not an admin, but I'm anxious to see the site design. Any word on this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Philip A few days ago I heard that Jin had received the design and was working with the designer making a few changes. Hopefully this means that the design is imminent. However, I do share your anxiousness - it's now been over a month since this topic was posted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle: Thanks for the update. Cheersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle, @Philip I have received the designs from Mike. I'm making some last round of tweaks before I present them to you. Should be in the next couple days. Thank you for your patience!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't see where it originated, but the current tagline *Answers for your Apple questions* works very nicely for me. In general I hate taglines, but with the pleasantly short simple title **Ask Different** it works very well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Amazing that people back in 2011 already thought the "Think Different" ad campaign was a bit obscure and long in the tooth (discontinued in 2002). Here in 2021 it seems borderline ridiculous to base the name of the site on an ad campaign nearly 20 years out of date.


















In addition to being too short, just calling our site "Apple" would probably result in some trademark issues. "Apple Q&A" might work, but I have to say that I did like the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9/domain-name-suggestions/24#24top domain name suggestion "Ask Different".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like "Ask Different" a lot, maybe have a tagline to go with it "There's an answer for that."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5or title: "Apple Q&A" tagline: "There's an answer for that."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My suggestion would be to title the site 'Apple Q&A' and the tagline to be 'Ask Different' because I really like that line.


















I disagree about combining control modifiers into the same kbd tags. For example, rather than 


  To quit, type: ⌘Q


I think that the following makes much more sense:


  To quit, type: ⌘+Q


For a few reasons:


There is no ⌘Q key. using a <kbd> tag makes the item appear like a key on the keyboard, and placing ⌘Q together inside the <kbd> tag gives the appearance that there is a single key ⌘Q, when in fact there are two seperate keys
Despite my personal dislike of the "+" sign in the above notation, http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/277400#277400it is the most common way of indicating that two keys should be pressed in conjunction.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also feel strongly that it's confusing to have the tag make up a key that doesn't exist. The tag denotes a physical key - not that two keys should be pressed in sequence or synchronically. I think it's good to debate whether _ or + or , or - or nothing to separate them, but inventing an imaginary combination key is what having two characters inside the same `` tag implies to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would also like to add that we should maybe follow what Apple actually puts on their recent keyboards: i.e. write shift *not* ⇧ and option not ⌥b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree about combining the modifiersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, for Mac modifiers, you shouldn't use <kbd> tags at all, the system displays them bare in menus. (:


















Or maybe try to find a combination of all of the above.

Title: Apple Q&A

Tagline: ask different, there’s an answer for that.

or if we switch…

Title: Ask Different

Tag: There’s an answer for that Apple

something like that to satisfy both Apple wanters and tagliners only :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could work, but it seems like a mouthfulb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for the first Title and Tag


















Okay, one more idea I just came up with:

Ask Different: Apple Q&A For The Rest Of Us

It uses the favored URL, it uses "Apple" to make it clear the intent for the site in a place that would most likely fall under fair use, and it might look actually good on a t-shirt (but not as a tattoo). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like this one best :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ooh. Well "Think Different" was discontinued in 2002, soon 9 years gone. See? We can't win here. Aaigh!


















Please try not to laugh too hard... I had an idea while I was reading the comments regarding the site title and logo design.  I am obviously not a graphic designer, but the SuperUser site combined with the Finder gave me this idea.  I tried to make it look pretty by using my monospace fonts all blown up in Vim, then editing it in Seashore, which resulted in this disaster:



I am so crappy at doing that kind of stuff that I ended up just drawing it with the pencil tool to at least give a rough idea of what was in my head :)



I have no idea whether this is legally acceptable or not, but there it is.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But… don’t we all hate the Finder? :))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Martin: hah I guess that's true.  Maybe I should try the Path Finder logo? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good idea. Because when you type "Mac" in Google Image search, the first symbol that is not showing an apple is the Finder symbol... 1 Up!


















I was just reminded of this classic Macintosh icon - http://www.storybytes.com/view-moof/articles/mim.htmlClarus the Dogcow:



It might be a bit too obscure, but it could definitely serve as a "secret handshake" of sorts. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I miss Clarus. We could go really obscure and use Mister Macintosh.


















On 7 September, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/3/robert-cartainoRobert Cartaino♦ made the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/86/moderator-pro-tem-announcement/Moderator Pro Tem Announcement, listing as moderators:


     




But now…


When I look at our https://apple.stackexchange.com/aboutAbout page today, I see the moderators listed as:


  


I was surprised to not see an announcement/acknowledgement here of some sort, so I figured I'd post one. (you're soaking in it!)

@Chealion, many thanks for your hard work! (and please don't leave us altogether)

@Calavera, congrats on the promotion!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Change in moderatorsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Calavera : Gratz! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Martin: thanks!  Now I'm +1/-1 for positive to negative posts on meta about me :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5lol... like you said, it's a badge of honor :)


















I’m adding an answer although it is kind of unrelated to the “question”. "tip o’ the antler" to Calavera for teaching me the ‘sub' tag

I’d love to help moderate, but my English is not native and as such, I usually make mistakes and I don’t think it would be a good idea. In any case, if we really need another one, I would gladly help, especially if the site’s traffic starts increasing and “moderation” workload is increased. 

Just have me as candidate on hold. :)

When I noticed that Chealion was no longer a moderator and that Studer hasn't even visited the site in two months, I contacted Robert and recommended calavera for the position. He's been really active on the main site, here on meta, he frequently flagged stuff for moderator attention, and he's taken an active role in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/194/question-deletion/196#196trying to clean up the site.

Congratulations on the promotion calavera - you've earned it!

The announcement simply trailed behind the appointment. No slight intended. Congratulations to @calavera and thank you for stepping up! The moderator announcement has been updated:

He requested to step down for personal reasons. Studer has not been active but he still retains his moderator abilities and is always welcome to return. The linked post contains the list of the current moderator team.


















There’s no question in this question, and whether you believe/like/hate/ignore/etc., this is a time where a lot of people stays with family and such. I can’t because mine is on the other side of the world, but in any case, I wish all of you happy holidays.

Don’t drink and drive and reload your energies because next year we’ll have a lot of questions to answer :)

Thanks to all who voted up/down and participated in the community so far.

I asked Ivo to migrate a bunch of my Mac questions from Super User - the ability to "Migrate to any site" was recently added to the mod tools. If you have some old questions on Super User, you might want to email one of the moderators and ask that they be migrated here.

Here's my shot at it:



Yanked from http://macamour.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/macosx_kernel_panic.pnghttp://macamour.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/macosx_kernel_panic.png

The image and style (translated text) would be great. But the actual text needs to be changed...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Clever, but for any usage I think we would need all of the non-English languages translated. Google Translate doesn't count.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can have it perfectly translated to Spanish, Italian and German. I have a french friend who would be able to do the French part. Good luck with the… japanese?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why translate it?  It's the way the kernel panic screen looks and is a huge part of the gag.  It doesn't have to have every language in the workd on it, that's not the way the real one looks.


















We could use the image that a Mac uses when it can't find the startup drive:



It's a little small, but we could scale it/pad it with gray.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sure Jin could riff on that theme and come up with something appropriate that would work with the site's style.

Should the arrows actually be arrows-with-tails as currently listed, or should they be replaced with ▲ ◀ ▼ and ▶ which are used on the arrow keys currently?

Can we all file a bug report with apple now to riot for some consistency?


















We seem to be having more and more of these types of posts lately.  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6078/disable-the-disk-was-not-ejected-properly-message"Answers" where the user is really providing commentary on the question asked, or opinions on whether or not the scenario in question is "good" or "right" (the answers in the linked question were converted to comments, so you may or may not see them, depending on your rep).  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3200/why-itunes-doesnt-automatically-refresh-the-media-library"Questions" where the user is actually critiquing a particular design choice or implementation that they do not personally agree with.

How should we deal with these types of posts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Non-answers disguised as answers, and non-questions disguised as questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm confused... Is this question a question? I don't see a "?" above. Perhaps I should be writing this as an answer, not a comment :).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mankoff: you're not confused, it's definitely not a question.  More of a rant :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yes, my reaction here is.. what is the question? What are you proposing? This is unclear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose I should have posted my own thoughts on the subject as an answer rather than part of the question. edited :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5oooooooh sweet irony.


















Moderators now have the ability to convert an answer to a comment, so it's pretty easy to fix the "non-answer disguised as answer" problem, we just need users to flag answers that should be comments and/or deleted.

Given your example, I'm not sure what you mean by "non-questions", as the questions you linked to seem OK. Part of the process of answering a question is to determine what the user actually means and wants, and it's fine for answers to address the problem or issue rather than to provide a solution to the actual question.

Also, I disagree that "No, it can't be done" isn't an answer. If something certainly cannot be done, that's the correct answer, but again in addition to answering the question, you should also try to see if you can find an alternative solution that solves all or part of the underlying issue.

Of course, there are https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/4871/revisionssome questions where the asker isn't participating in good faith, but these are rare.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin: non-questions aren't as big of a problem. The first link is meant as an example of non-answers, though they've been converted to comments. I didn't use the question you mentioned because it has had enough attention and I figured it was pretty blatant anyway.  However, the question I linked from Lorenzo, taken in the context of the comments he posted after answers, is IMO a thinly veiled rant.  There is no particular task he is asking for help in accomplishing. I see almost no difference between it and the other, albeit longer, rant you linked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera True, there is some language ("design flaw", etc) that suggests that it's a bit of a rant, so it would probably be a good idea to edit the question a bit to make it more objective.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin: That's exactly what I was pushing for when i closed it originally, i even said so in a comment at that time.  Instead of editing it to make the question more clear, Lorenzo instead took it as an opportunity to call me a fanboy :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera ...and I have.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin: and... reopened :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera It's probably easier and less confrontational to just edit out parts of the post that are ranting than it is to close the post and ask the OP to do itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin: Not necessarily... we all saw what happened when we tried to do that with the question you linked.  Also, in this case, I have a bit of a conflict of interest.  Since Lorenzo never clearly stated what he wanted to do, we were left to assume.  Since I had already provided an answer that gave specific suggestions, any edits to the question on my part could be seen as forming the question around my answer...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera Ah, I've been there before. In cases like that, just flag it or post in the mod chat that you'd like a different mod to take a look at it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin: there's also the question of whether we should be taking the time to fix people's questions when they refuse to.  It seems like kind of a waste of energy in the long run, especially since we don't know what they really want (other than to provoke) in the first place.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and... the OP then receives reputation for a question they didn't really write.  Why should someone be allowed to post a rant, have it edited by a mod or other user, and then receive upvotes based on someone else's cleanup?  If we're really going to clean up peoples rants, then afterward they should be converted to community wiki so the OP doesn't get to leech reputation.  Even if the underlying question is good enough that it should stay on the site, it doesn't necessarily follow that a trollish original question should earn the asker new privileges in the community.


















In order to increase the visibility of our site, we may want to start a social media presence. There is now an official http://twitter.com/#!/StackAppleTwitter feed for questions that people can follow and retweet. I've also set up a http://www.facebook.com/pages/Apple-Stack-Exchange/154758227909964Facebook page for people being able to 'like' the site and share with their friends.

Are there others that would be useful?

Hopefully we can get control over @askdifferent somehow...


















FYI, we are instituting standard Twitter feeds for all (public) sites; this feed will auto-populate with an interesting question from the site every ~3 hours.

I see Photo.se has an entry to left side of the landing page (http://photo.stackexchange.comhttp://photo.stackexchange.com). I wish Apple.se also could have the same.

But it's not (yet?) applied on our site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori, I don't know if it was included on DBA.SE. But first of all, Jeff didn't add the "status-completed" tag. So that *should* mean that they fixed it on DBA and he asked the dev team to fix it here too. But I'm just guessing.

I think it's great to announce, but I'd also encourage simple organic linking and sharing of relevant questions and answers.

On the main trilogy, there's a very consistent hard line drawn against amateur legal advice.

If you want to have the same policy here, you should vote to close:

In this case, I think the post is OK for the site, and it's gotten some decent answers.

In the future, you can flag a post for moderator attention and a moderator can migrate it to any SE site if it needs to be moved.

Hi all. I'm http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/Jin, and I'll be working on the designs for the Stack Exchange sites as they graduate from the beta phase. Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.

First, I want to say an early congrats for the upcoming launch of Apple.stackexchange.com. Thank you for being an awesome community!

As an Apple user myself, I've always appreciated Apple's designs in UI and hardware. I think what makes Apple's design stand out is that they pay great attention to detail. Apple draws a fine balance between eye-candy and simplistic elegance. 

The design goal for our Apple site is to maintain the branding of the Stack Exchange Q&A family, something you're familiar with from using the Beta site, or other SE sites. At the same time, the design needs to give this community its own identity that's associated with Apple. For new users to the site, the design should invoke that "Apple" feeling right away.

I had a great pleasure working with http://twitter.com/#!/flyosityMike Rundle, the talented designer who provided me with the initial mockups. I have since tweaked his designs a bit. I believe the designs below work well and represent what this site is about.

I'm aiming to have the site launched later this week, in time for the http://www.macworldexpo.com/Macworld Expo. 

Bonus: here's the publicity card we designed to be handed out at MacworldExpo:


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Design for the Apple StackExchange siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sweet, looks awesome! Sorry I wasn't more patient, but it was definitely worth the wait.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle My apologies for not pushing it out sooner. I was doing quite a bit pixel pushing. Also at the same time I needed to make sure the design would be implementable with the our HTML structure constraints and CSS3 limits. So there was a little of switching back 'n forth between Photoshop and looking at Firebug.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori, aiming for Thursday morning. 10am Cali time. I thought it starts officially on Thursday morning, according to their web site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any way to play with the design on a test site before it goes live?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle we have a dev server. That's where I deploy and test the design before it launches to live.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5care to share the address? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle I'm afraid it's a private server.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wanna know how new people can understand that this site is for asking about apple product? (fron GUI)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Am1rr3zA new people come from search engine, by searching for Apple related stuff. If they were brought here by a friend then they would have an idea what the site is about. As for the UI, the Command key in logo, the title and tag line. The tags that cover all the Apple related keywords. Also the New User box that's shown for the first time visitors clearly indicates this site is for Apple related questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Surely the display should not change just when we go live. testing the interface is a part of beta testing. Production should be the same as the last beta - otherwise you need to retest.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just a quick aside: we run a usability testing service at http://intuitionhq.com - I'd be more than happy to set you up with a test just so you can check how the new design is working out. Let me know if you're interested and I'll get on to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IntuitionHQ neat service! maybe after the site is launched. I typically do a lot of post production tweaking. I'll let you know. Keep in mind I'm only doing a "skin" job more or less. For major usability issues, I'd rather to fix it SE network wide since all the sites use the same features and HTML code base. Maybe it'd be more beneficial to do a usability test for stackoverflow.com instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OMG QUIT HOLDING OUT THAT'S FRACKING AWESOME JIN I'M HATING ALL OF THE REST OF SOIS SITES NOW BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori I'm still working on the CSS conversion. there's a lot to be done. The conversion is more involved than any SE sites I've done.  Realistically, the site will be launched early tomorrow morning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jin stop QQ'ing and get more Bacon. You clearly need some at the moment. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jin Just loving it, whatever you change or not. It's excellent right now. With any proposed changes implemented, it will be hmm.... excellent. Our lovely site with its new design. Can't wait anymore! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori it's go time!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin: You just raised the bar for SE site L&F! Looks great man.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This looks absolutely awesome. I see the site and instantly think iPad. Very well done!!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin, this site design is awesome.  Well done to you and those you worked with.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Probably the greatest compliment I can pay is in my recent post under **preferred alternatives to Apple Support Communities for providing support to users and developers of Apple products and services**: [The Ask Different experience is incredibly satisfying. In a nutshell: I find what exists there faultless — a rare unconditional compliment from me](https://discussions.apple.com/message/15810775#15810775) … I use the word *faultless* [extremely rarely](http://tinyurl.com/graham-faultless) :-) Thanks to Jin and everyone else who makes Ask Different so pleasing!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the new colors bar. “We bleed in six colors”


















The design looks great, I have a few suggestions if you're open to them. They're small things, but I know that "small" doesn't always mean "easy to change". :)

On most of the other SE sites, the ask button is separated and more distinct from the rest of the top navigation, usually a different color. Is there a way we could get it to stand out more?

Would it be possible for the sidebar to maybe look more like a drawer? I.e. something like https://i.stack.imgur.com/7KUjt.pngthis?

I'm not crazy about the yellow gradient behind the question title (and it wouldn't work if the sidebar became a drawer) and it looks like it might not handle long titles well. Using the same format as "Top Questions" on the home page screenshot might work better, or even just putting the title down in the body.

Using an envelope at the top of the screen made sense when that was the notification for new replies, but now that that's been shifted to the unified inbox maybe it could be replaced with something more suitable that means "recent activity" - a clock maybe?

I think it might look better if the font used for the question list were regular instead of bold

The tags are white on white with a faint border, which makes them blend into the page. Maybe add a very light background color, or even just a stronger border? I also think that maybe a more rounded shape, like the mail recipient bubble in iOS, might look better than the generic tag look:


The global inbox/Stack Exchange logo is a little hard to read as it's white on light gray (very light at the top)

In the sidebar, "interesting tags" and "Ignored Tags" have slightly different styles. I like the font used for "Ignored Tags", but I also would like to keep the text all lowercase like "interesting tags"


Even if you don't change a thing, it still looks great and I can't wait to launch! Would it be possible to use the askdifferent.com domain as the primary domain for the site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Kyle, good points. I'll see what I can do. I typically do a a lot tweaking as I convert to CSS based on feedback. The drawer idea is interesting, i'll see if it's feasible to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Cool - I might be pushing my luck, but how feasible would it be to have a button that toggles the drawer? Because that would be awesome :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle are you a disciple of Kai Krause? :) I'm afraid it's not feasible at all :(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin I thought I'd try anyway. I hadn't heard of Krause, but I'll do some research and let you know :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori it was a compliment. I think I'm one of very few people who actually loved Kai's UI back in the 90s. As outrageous as it was, it did pave the way for a lot of visual elements we see today. Kai also wrote some of the earliest Photoshop tuts on the internet, as well a comprehensive study of realistic rendering of shapes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle, I'm for changing the shape of the tag to the capsule. However I'm reserved about changing the color. Colored tags may look good on the actual question page, but they'll totally clutter up the homepage and question listing page when repeated. you can try to play with the concept yourself. Maybe I'll end up using a super faint blue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Definitely keep the color faint, the image in my post was meant to show the shape I was talking about, but not the color. However, I'm not sure what you mean when you say that tags with background colors clutter the page - the majority of SE sites have tags with a different background color than the page they're on and they look fine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Hi, in the few days since joining Ask Different I have had problems at least twice with the paleness of the pale blue text on white background; paleness of pale blue text on pale blue background. I wasn't going to mention it but on both occasions, the word blindness from lack of contrast contributed to confusion. FYI asked as a question: [Is the pale blue of texts — on white and pale blue backgrounds — too pale at Ask Different?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/638/8546) — if you'd prefer me to convert that question to an answer here, just say. Thanks :-)


















I think it looks awesome!  A couple points:


Have you tried a version of the interface where the right hand sidebar is swapped to the left side?  I know this is totally different from other SE sites, but this is Apple.SE after all, and it might look really cool since Apple apps tend to have a left hand sidebar.
I love the menubar look at the top.  Similar to above, I think it would look perfect if the "word" links (logout, chat, etc) moved over to the left like the Mac menubar, and any icon based links would be on the right.  Maybe even put a mini version of the clover logo on the top left? :)
I 100% agree with Kyle on the tags thing... It would be great to have the tags look like the little bubbles used for selecting multiple bits of information in many apps and preference dialogs.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera, my concern is that it's not convention for our sites. the top left spot is always reserved for the SE logo. I'll definitely do some tweaking to the tags. However I'm careful about not to give it too much visual attention(colors, 3d etc) because when heavily repeated on the question listing page, they'll make the site seem very busy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Initially I was skeptical, but it actually [looks pretty good](http://i.imgur.com/AxkHu.png). I left SE in the top left though, as @Jin said, because it's a platform standard.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle: that looks awesome!  The only thing is that I really like the "drawer" look on the right side, but not quite as much when the bar is on the left.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin: maybe if they just had a more rounded look with a relatively light background color?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera So keep the drawer on the right? Or did you want the original sidebar on the left?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin: I guess I'd like to see how the original sidebar looks on the left compared to the drawer style on the left.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera [here you go](http://i.imgur.com/92Ye9.png)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin: nevermind, the drawer style looks better :P


















Well, I'd like to add my 2¢

I Agree with most of Kyle's points.

In no particular order…


The Drawer idea is neat, I don't like it on the left side. It would disrupt the whole website look (in comparison to other SE sites). 
The "ASK Question" (and the whole line) deserves some attention, it's too subtle and sites like Ubuntu have a very distinctive "ask", separated from the rest. However Cooking has a single line, all the same color. I'm not sure which one is better, but I am sure that the current implementation in those designs is not very easy to read. 
We could use something from the Finder itself: 

If anything, the disclose triangles would help.
The yellow/greenish/iTunes gradient in the title question: I like it, at least at first. It remains to be seen how would that work for a longer title and/or what happens if it's made a little bit smaller/non bold. I like how it gives the Apple look. I'd probably try using iTunes colors tho. As ugly as iTunes may be, it's some sort of "visual trademark".


Compare: 


vs




The envelope: A few sites still use them, but there are some notable exceptions, like Askubuntu, which uses an @. I don't know about this. :s
Tags: I believe tags could be tweaked to look like Mac tags. There are numerous examples around. For example, taken from "http://culturedcode.com/things/Things":





Completely agree that the Stackexchange icon/logo is hard to read with the current colors. I believe that the text should be made Gray/Black like the res of the "menu bar".
I liked the idea of moving the "texts" to the left and leaving the icons on the right, I don't know if that's possible.
The search box is ok, looks like apple (kinda) but… i'd use something more spotlight like:


 


Agree with Kyle about the style in interesting tags/Ignored. Lower case wins. Ignored Tags style too.


A few contributions of my own


The Answer editor, has a black background in the toolbar, it looks "cool" but has nothing to do with Apple's applications or Cocoa. I'd like an idea more oriented towards a standard Cocoa app, that "blends" with the text:





The "Post Your Answer" button is ok too, but should be on the right. Mac users are used to button alignment "the right way"™ ;)
The "Answered" box (green) should be the same color as the "iTunes" thing we mentioned earlier. That green might look nice, but has nothing to do there. The orange, blue, black, gray, makes it look too full of colors. 


Conclusion

The design looks neat and even if we don't change anything, it's very nice and I really like it. Would love to be able to "use" it to see how it feels. Thanks for including a question where my name appears :)

And where's Apple? 

As pointed by Am1rr3zA, the only caveat is that by "just" looking at that, there's no indication whatsoever that this is a place for asking questions about Apple. The cloverleaf is nice, but not immediately associated with Apple (unless you are an Apple user already) but Windows users using Apple products, have no ⌘ in their computers and/or keyboards. Perhaps the mailbox icon could be replaced with a little Apple? ;-)

@Jin, great work. @All of us, gratz for what we've accomplished so far and thanks to @jeff and company for all their hard work. We're just insignificant peasants in what is already the greatest network of Q&A.

This is a webpage heavy on text content, not an app.


















As others note the site needs to make it clear it is for Apple questions - perhaps as a sub text saying Mac, iPhone, iPad (and whatever else Apple do).

Ask Different does not make me think of Apple at all - and I have use Apple PCs for 10 years. (When did Apple last use Think Different and have they ever used in connection with iPhones etc?) (Ah google from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Differentwikipaedia says 2002 so NOTHING to do with iPhones, iPods etc.

I would not I am in the UK so have not seen US based advertising.

I can change the tag line to something more descriptive, "Answers for your Apple questions"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When was the vote?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mark here's the domain voting thread: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9/domain-name-suggestions/24#24b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think Apple has had a really has a significant tagline or slogan for quite a while. There was the whole "Hi, I'm a Mac" string of commercials, but offhand I don't think there would be an easy way to make that fit in the paradigm of this website.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Philip Regan: +250 Apple slogans and *accelerating*: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_Inc._slogans b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Robert: I'm talking about company-wide slogans, something that defines the company, not individual products. "Switch" was the last one in 2003. But that list is an excellent source of content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the benefit of newcomers to this question/answer: [Official Site Title](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/205/8546)


















As an aside, Apple modified their own homepage… blackening the header:



A hint of the future?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5saw this already. I've updated the topbar style locally already to mimic the look. I'm still keeping our topbar lighter though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jin in any case, i believe that Apple.SE's topbar tries to mimic OSX's menu bar rather than that type of bar. Did we go too crazy with the "requests" ? :) Nothing that some bacon can't solve…b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ín i like the suggestions so far, many great points. I won't be able to implement them all for the launch, but there's definitely room for tweaking, as always. re: bacon, you know my weak spot...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Don't worry, let's ship, then tweak, as already mentioned; or Bacon. ;)


















I have to say that out of everything on here, this is the only part I feel really strongly about:



Even though this is a different convention, I really think that it fits so well and looks so great that it outweighs any negative in this case... Thanks to Kyle for throwing it together
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know about the © but I'd definitely add the  instead of the Mailbox if possible ;)


















Personally, I'd like to change:

The kind that don't bump the retagged questions to the top.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Am1rr3za: good point. @Loic: yes, but for some reason I wasn't thinking of synonyms :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did all the ones @Dori listed other than osx.  Plus the other iosx tags (4.2, 3).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that we should try to have the tag as close to the actual product name as possible. For example, mac-os-x instead of osx.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera I think it's better to change windows7 tag to windows-7 too.


















I like it. It could be tweaked, but then all complex projects like this could be tweaked, and while I don't entirely disagree with what's being suggested, we could "design by committee" this thing 'til the cows come home. 

I say, let it fly.

Am not sure what happened to Apple.se website and it's Meta websites, both are showing as Android Operating System power users.

Add a comment if you had Apple.StackExchange.com loaded today and refreshed the page "N" times to see if the new design appeared…

What exactly does Ask Different have to do with Apple? AskApple surely?


It doesn't fit with the URL
It doesn't fit the names of other stackexchange sites, which are pretty much the same from beta to non-beta.
Ask Ubuntu is a good name, its where you ask about Ubuntu
Ask Different, ask different to what
How many people actually know about the ad campaign
The legal issue is not with having "Apple" in the title, it's with the use of the Apple Logo, this post isn't about changing the logo (cmd button)


5 votes up, so that's almost half of the 13 votes for Ask Different. Please upvote the answer in this thread if you think the site title should be changed: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/205/official-site-title/301#301Official Site Title
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ask Different, really? Surely Ask Appleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The use of 'Apple' and the possible trademark infringements is discussed in this meta thread where input on the site name solicited http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/205/official-site-titleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But apple is used during the beta and is innthe site URL?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The discussion of the use of "Apple" centered around the use of the logo——not the name. The name has been used on numerous websites discussing Apple for years ("As The Apple Turns" anyone?) with no public complaint from Apple, Inc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So use the name ask apple with the current logo???b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonathan, if apple was actually here and participating, sure, but they hardly participate in some of their own forums... so I doubt that's going to happen.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cabbey, But as pointed out earlier by Philip Regan, Apple is used in other websites' titles. So Apple doesn't have to be here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonathan, my point was "Ask Apple" implies that Apple is actually here, participating. I don't care about if other sites used the word in some way. I care about what the tagline implies about this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @cabbey in that Ask Apple implies you're asking Apple Inc directly. As far as trademarks and possible violations, there are many sites out there using the "Mac" and "Apple" terms with no problems (as well as brick and mortar Mac repair shops). I can think of AppleInsider, MacRumors, MacTech, MacHeist, The Unofficial Apple Weblog, Macworld, etc. I think we could still use the "Mac" term safely as those other sites do. Perhaps something that plays to StackExchange and Mac, like MacExchange, MacOverflow, MacQuestions... As much as I liked the Think Different campaign, it is outdated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With respect: *Ask Apple* could be too misleading. If my first visit to a site labelled *Ask the BBC* revealed viewers and listeners but no-one from the BBC, I would take a dim view and probably not revisit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's quite difficult to understand when there is a copyright infringement when the used word is a common noun. For example, if I called a company _Pear_, I could not talk of copyright infringement every time somebody writes an article about pears. I am not use common nouns can be copyrighted, in the same way numbers cannot be copyrighted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could a name be "Ask about Apple" ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Totally in agreement. ASkDifferent is very unusual for an exchange name. It's borderline esoteric, it's undescriptive of the content in the exchange, and is misleading to google'ers/passer-bys. Naming the exchange after a single ad campaign is just silly, not everyone knows it. Also, the current name is like a giant advertisement for Apple... which should be frowned upon (no exchange should promote any single vendor, just focus on questions and answers).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another example of the static assumption pitfall : not considering that something different at present may become pedestrian in the future.


















Think Different was a hugely successful ad campaign by Apple:


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just wonder how man people actually connect the two seeing as it *was* an ad. Surely this suffers from the same legal issues as using the apple name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and how long ago was the ad? and has it ever related to iPhones and iPads?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apple has not had a company-wide slogan since "Switch" around 2003. A lot of product-specific slogans, but nothing that encompasses the company as a whole. Basing the name of the site on "Think Different", arguably one of Apple's most popular campaigns, was voted on by the community a while ago.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It has less than 20 votes. So it can be assumed that's the 20 most apple switched on people of this site as there are many more users who haven't voted. When things like the title are being decided on it needs a banner at the top of the main site with a link to the topic to make people more awareb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonathon: The discussions over the title and design were publicly available for months the meta site is busy with all sorts of other topics about site management, some arguably more important than this. I'm sorry you don't like the branding of the site, but it's not as though nobody was allowed to comment and vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The site title is quite a big thing, and only a small percentage of people visit meta sites, and a smaller amount of people think that they are worthy to affect decisions like this. The Topic that chooses the site title should be put in a banner at the top of the main site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are 3200 apple users and only 270 meta.apple usersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonathon: At the risk of sounding rude, but what's your point? Meta (for all of the SE sites) is a clear link near the top right of almost every page on the site. If people can't be bothered to go to Meta and take an interest in how the community is to run, that's really isn't anybody's fault but their own. There is only so much that can be done with a bunch of volunteers to make this place run smoothly (and it is run very smoothly). I'm sorry you don't like the name, but what's done is done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Philip LOL at your 'Jonathon'. @Jonathan I like the name. And I don't want to sound rude but you have been a member for 5 months yet you have barely participated except for the last few days. The question in meta (in which you added your opinion) has been there for a long time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark re: iPhone, iPad etc: many non-Mac devices are used with Mac hardware — [NumberKey](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/numberkey/id291672903) is a more exotic example; most **associations between Mac and non-Mac devices are subliminal**.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ahhh I get it now!


















The color scheme on the priviledges page is so dark, it's barely readable. So is the red warning messages I get while posting. Tried multiple browsers, multiple PC's, pretty much the same everywhere.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Color scheme hard to readb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looks like a bug.


















Hi all,

As you can see the new design is live, which means Apple.stackexchange.com has been officially launched! Congratulations! Also thank you for the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/268/design-for-the-apple-stackexchange-sitefeedback on the initial design. I was able to make some changes based on your input, and I think there's still room for fine tuning. 

I have to say converting the Apple.se design to CSS has been quite a challenge for me, it's probably the hardest SE site I've done so far. (All the SE sites use the same HTML code base on Stackoverflow.com.). There are still some known glitches which I'll iron out tonight and this weekend. I know the formatting of the tag-related sections are a bit off, and so are some Moderator pages. 

I used quite a bit of CSS3 during the conversion. According to our web stats, nearly 87% of you use CSS3 capable browsers. The site should degrade gracefully with older browsers.

If you see any other styling issues, please start a new question and tag it with [design] and [bug] instead of replying to this post. That way I can track your bug reports easily.

If you're still seeing the old favicons, load the follow 2 urls in your browser and hard refresh:

http://sstatic.net/apple/img/favicon.icohttp://sstatic.net/apple/img/favicon.ico

There may be others, but these are the ones I've run across.
I don't think that any of them are due to my custom CSS or GreaseMonkey scripts, but if they are, feel free to publicly point at me and laugh.

The SO HTMLs aren't really set up for this. For the Apple site I had to request a few HTML changes to the dev team. The badge page was fine soon after the launch, but we found out the HTML change caused some network wide bugs, so we had to revert it. Instead of changing the html, we'll add more css hooks instead. Same goes for the mod pages. btw I hope you had fun at Macworld Expo!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Woo published author, nice! The challenging part isn't the actual CSS styling, it's more about applying CSS around SO's HTMLs. We're adding more hooks so the same CSS classes can be styled differently per page, per section etc. This isn't typically a problem since most SE sites have one solid color for the site bg, or content section.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori, I didn't mean it that way either ! Any help is welcome of course! Sibling selector is a great suggestion. I think it'd help me a great deal without adding much html hooks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In fact your sibling selector suggestion just helped me to fix the badge page. thanks! it will be in the next build.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori, I've fixed the issues in the updated screenshots. Please verify.


















I just wanted to give a quick thanks to Jin, Mike Rundle, and the Apple.SE community for all the hard work on what is a very slick design. This place looks great! (Not that I minded the beta design, actually. I'm helping out on Graphic Design.SE and the Beta design brings back some fond memories).

Less an answer and more an FYI:

Because of this, there are now only 3 users other than the moderators who can cast close votes. For everyone who is not a mod or one of "the 3" (new superhero team name?), please help us out by flagging stuff that needs to be closed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pardon what might be a basic question of the SE community, but does site graduation also equate to opening up moderator positions to make up for the deficit? I have little time right now (classes started), but I would be happy to help moderate when I can if the community would have me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PhilipRegan: I'm not 100% positive, but I don't think the graduation automatically means we'll add pro-tem mods.  However, I'm pretty sure it means we will have moderator elections in the relatively near future.

This is fixed on live, both the main site and Meta

Is http://askdifferent.comaskdifferent.com always going to redirect to http://apple.stackexchange.comapple.stakexchange.com?
My understanding was that the site would, like the other graduated SE sites, be accessed and used by our unique domain. I would expect apple.stackexchange.com to redirect to the main site on askdifferent.com.

Is that on the way, or am I missing something?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New Domain: Redirection vs New Locationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, most of the other graduated SE sites are *not* accessed through a separate domain (just look at http://webapps.stackexchange.com, http://gaming.stackexchange.com, etc); askubuntu.com is the lone exception (along with the original Stack Overflow "trilogy")b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you if SE want keep Ask Different for this site better redircet apple.stackexchange.com to askdifferent.comb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonik and Superuser.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NathanG. Super User is not a Stack Exchange 2.0 site (in the sense that it did not graduate from A51 et al)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nathan: The ["trilogy"](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/), which I mentioned, means Stack Overflow, Server Fault and Super User.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Long backstory: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/domain-names-the-wrong-question/ and http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/stack-exchange-naming-for-dummies/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@vxjason Nice, that explains it. Post as answer and I'll accept.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I haven't written that much, that quickly, in a long time...


















I am not sure if this only happened to me or if anyone else has the same problem, but after the official launch of Ask Different this website has become very slow for me. For example, while scrolling up and down, instead of a continuous loading of the page it is more like frame by frame. And when typing, the characters do not show up as fast as I type.

I'm on Mac OS X 10.6.6, and use firefox 3.6.10. Also, I have a macbook-pro 2010 13" with 4GB 1067MHz DDR3 RAM, and a 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.

I can't repro this. But I've had performance issues with Firefox sometimes, not just with our site. I believe FF has a memory issue, if I have many tabs open and leave them on for a while, all sites I visit become so slow. 

Can you check how much memory FF is using in Activity Monitor when you experience performance issue? I've found that sometimes FF can take up gigs of memory. That's why for personal use I have switched to Chrome. I only use FF for development.

It will go back to normal mode the next time you run it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cala I know how to switch to safe mode but I rarely restart my laptop.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Am1rr3zA: you don't have to restart the laptop after using safe mode, you just restart firefox.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cala oh sorry man I think you said book OS X in safe mode :(, I write the result after the test.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cal I test in safe mode but I still have this problem :(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Am1rr3zA: no problem, I had a feeling we were having a communication problem :)  Sorry it didn't work, worth a try though I guess.

I just re-calc'd your rep to verify that it was over 1K, and it is.

I get the impression that you're expecting to see something different on pages with votes, and that's not actually the case. If you take a look at the https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/view-vote-countsprivilege page, you see this figure:

The hook

Mac users think differently, we work differently, we use our computers differently... why then should we get answers the same way everyone else does? 

The line

Why not Ask Differently?

The sinker

That's what we are, a different way for Apple users to connect with each other to find solutions to their problems and answers to their questions from a trusted community of fellow users.



ok, the above follows an approach to the "elevator pitch" I learned a long time ago in school. Three parts: hook, line and sinker. When presented the hook and line always go together. If you got anything resembling a positive reaction, you followed up with the sinker. (yes, it's a poor analogy to fishing. The sales guys that were teaching that communications class could never give a good answer for why those names were used when the first two should be reversed.)

Hat tip to the folks on the domain name thread for 'ask differently'.

options: "Apple" or "Mac"... I ended up using both, not sure if we've got a clear definition of which we want here. The work item could come out of the hook to tighten it up, or if you have space it could be expanded to add in a play clause... or any other verb, similar to the PS3 "It only does..." hook.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5would be nice if the down voters could explain what they don't like about it.


















Like Kyle said, "Think Different" was (and technically still is) Apple's motto and slogan. They have used it since 1984, I believe, and it has become a staple of their corporation's identity. Honestly I would say that 90% of Apple's users over the age of 18 would recognize this slogan immediately, and the play on it is perfect for this site. I think that it ads a touch of elegance to it, and I also think that it gives those of us who know way too much about Apple some sort of nostalgia/sense of being (I can't really place the proper word for this but I'm sure some of you out there are feeling the same as me).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What? Think Different was NOT used since 1984, it came around in the late 90s ('97, I believe). And it is not "technically" still their slogan. The campaign ended years ago. That said, I personally like the name Ask Different :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you remember the 1984 ad (or at least seeing it), the parody of the movie/book 1984? The lady shattered the screen that forced everybody to think the same. That was when the aptly named campaign started, which was in 1984. I think that it is technically still their slogan. Just because you stop advertising it doesn't make it obsolete, and they haven't replaced it with another company-wide slogan. They also still have it on products/signs in their corporate campus and store last time I was there. That said, I too like the phrase Ask Different!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How many iPhone and iPad users know about this slogan?For most of people name of the site doesn't make sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The campaign was created in 1997. See [The Real Story Behind Apple's 'Think Different' Campaign](https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2011/12/14/the-real-story-behind-apples-think-different-campaign/#d48c98562abc) written by Rob Siltanen,who was the creative director and managing partner at TBWA/Chiat/Day working on the Apple pitch alongside CEO and Chief Creative Officer Lee Clow.


















I know what you're saying. I guess the comments are visually distinguished by a different colored background and a little bit different formatting (including being indented into the post).

Overall they could make it a little more clear, but I think the system does them justice as it is.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For me the background of the post and the comments are both white. Are they supposed to be a different color? To me it isn't clear at all.


















This was intentional. I felt a smaller text fits the apple theme better. It makes the site a bit airier. Originally I had planned for the Question/Answer text even smaller(12px) to be consistent with the official http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2741010&tstart=0Apple forum. However I felt it was a bit too small, so I went with 13 pixels instead. If I had followed the convention you stated, that'd make the comment text too small to read IMO. I feel the current white background makes the comment text distinguishable enough. Another factor is, unlike the other SE sites, this site's question and answer(s) have their own colored block. So it's easier to scan.

Of course the new design has only gone live for a few days, it may take a bit to get used to the new design.

For me the indentation isn't enough to offset them as comments and it can be confusing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Jin, can you revisit this with the new Lion inspired theming? While I agreed with you before, white boxes on white background doesn't leave much distinction anymore.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cabbey they look the same size to me now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jeff, Sorry, I wasn't clear. I was talking about the colors... not the size. Specifically "Another factor is, unlike the other SE sites, this site's question and answer(s) have their own colored block. So it's easier to scan." that statement was used to justify the fonts being the same size, but it's no longer true with the new Lion inspired style.


















Ask Different has a nice style, but the favicon is still the old sketchy-style. That should be replaced. It's OK on chat and meta.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ask Different should have the correct faviconb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see the favicons (blue for Ask Different, grey for Ask Different meta) and so have flagged the question for tagging.

On my profile page in the reputation section the title text of a post I edited appears in a larger font.  I thought this might be a bug since it looked a bit out of place.  Screenshot below:

I made that icon from scratch and didn't think about the Gmail icon. I've seen plenty icon sets that has the mail icon similar to that. After all, it's just an envelope. The reason the unread icon is red is because that's our convention for all SE sites. The mail icon has a different style(flat) from the rest of the icon on the site because it sits on the top bar, should have an engraved looked like the embossed text on there. 

I don't think it's a major issue for now, unless more people object to it.

Martín, I'm using Chrome 9.0.597.84 and I'm not able to reproduce this. The duplicate question content loads right away. Or when I pasted an incorrect URL it displays the "Unable to find a question id in your input - please enter a question url or numeric id" message. 

How are you pasting the url? Using mouse click or cmd+v ? If this is an issue with Chrome 10.6.6 only, then we don't support Beta browsers.

The editing pages for tag wikis are not very legible, see screenshot below:

The data in the hover menu is fed off the wiki post, there is a slight edge condition where the data is cached for an hour. 

Also, while your edit is pending you will not be able to see the wiki excerpt in the hover menu. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK well I've created several wiki entries and this has happened for every one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Griffo , after they were approved it was still blank for longer than an hour?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They didn't require approval as far as I know, but they appeared as soon as I clicked the star to follow the tag.  So it appears that the wiki information was saved when I created it but wasn't linked to the tag unless I clicked the star to follow it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Griffo, yeah there is at least a 1 hour cache in play. Did they appear 1 hour later if you did not click followb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Haven't tested that yet, I'll try one later.  So you're saying that if I create a tag wiki, the description won't show in the hover bubble until the next cache load unless I force it by clicking follow?  What's the reason for that?  Would the hover action not trigger an AJAX request to populate the bubble?  Or was it decided that since they tag wikis don't change regularly that refreshing the cache hourly was sufficient?


















The fix will be in the next deployment.

On Chrome 9.0.597.84 on Windows Vista (don't ask...) on the https://apple.stackexchange.com/reviewreview page, the line separator (declared in .question-summary) is too long:

The theory, at least, is that some questions are about OS X Server in general, and some are about a specific version of OS X server—in the same fashion that some questions are tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osxosx and some https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/snow-leopardsnow-leopard.

When see this question I encounter below bug:


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Add Another Answer" button Bugb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i'm looking into this.


















The top of the page is great. 

I find the body text too difficult to read. Too heavy, too cluttered. I would suggest removing the high contrast boxes around the answers and sidebar. Use a simple light background that differentiate from the "paper" texture. Keep all the sweet details in the GUI: the buttons, the tags, the icons, etc.

Typography: I'm really a beginner there, but my feel is that the fonts are "monochromatic": the font size is too similar throughout the page. I think the design could use two contrasting types. Maybe one for titles and one for body.

The CC button at the bottom right seems to get far more highlight than it should relative to the rest of the content. I would have imagined it as subdued, flat, and really out of the way (ie. iconic).

Likewise for the logo icon. I like the COMMAND key symbol in the logo, but I feel the extra "recessed" border around it makes it heavy and cluttered. A simple drop shadow (basically the inner "button" in the symbol) would be sufficient.

The search box top right is a little thin and could use more vertical inner space.

Since the Design is heavily influenced by the Apple GUI, I'll try to find some comparisons:


The apple.com homepage: all the background is light (good), so that the main content really comes forward. Here, the main content is boxed into thick contrasting borders which feel really heavy and make it hard to separate the content from the design.
Note the main box on the apple.com homepage is a lighter color than the texture background, white, no texture. I think that would be best here. It would be a lot easier to read through the answers. It would "breathe" more.


Also, use more colour. I think that's an element of Apple's website design: contrasting the colours with the site layout which is essentially monochromatic.

Disclaimer: I'm not a designer, and I know it's easier to critique than do it. I appreciate the design work but with the best intentions, I just wanted to point out that the design is, all things considered, less "usable" (in terms of readability and conciseness) than the simple StackOverflow design. The ideal design imho would be to stop adding CSS3 cruft and remove things one by one until you get middle way between the sweet OS X inspired GUI, and the simplicity and lightness of the original StackOverflow design.

Designs that I find more readable:


ProWebmasters : could use a little differentiaton in background, or maybe a nice thin vertical line between body and sidebar, to guide the eye, but otherwise easy to read, which is what matters most on this type of site.
Game development : use the white background for body text, no boxes around answers (just simple lines, or dotted lines separation)

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/software-recommendationsoftware-recommendation tag means that someone is looking for software that works with Apple hardware (Mac or iDevices) or Apple software (OS X or iOS). As what they're looking for is related to their use of an Apple product, it's completely on topic.

While the FAQ says the questions must be about Apple hardware/software/other products or services, it doesn't say that it must solely be about them.

Now, given that, what kind of Apple-related questions would I take to SU? Probably ones along the lines of getting Ubuntu to play well with a Mac network, or an issue with something inside Windows running in VMWare. As those aren't primarily Apple-related questions, they could be seen as off-topic here.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/volumevolume tag is currently applied to nine questions:


Four of them use it to describe mounted disks
Five of them use it to describe audio sound levels


Tags with multiple meanings are barely more useful than no tag at all.

Any suggestions on which of these should be renamed, and to what?



Update:

I don't think we need a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-volumedata-volume tag, as it looks like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/disk-spacedisk-space is sufficient.

I went through the posts and made some edits:


Where volume referred to audio levels, I added the already-existing https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/audioaudio tag
Where volume referred to mounted disks, I added the already-existing https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hard-drivehard-drive tag


Once I'd done that, it appeared that Jeff was right that we may not need the volume tag at all, so I removed it from each.

Should https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/volumevolume be added to the blacklist?

As far as Super User is concerned, Apple question are on topic, and unless the questions is about an iPod, iPhone, iPad, or has not received a correct answer in a reasonable amount of time, it will remain on Super User.

The 2011 Community Moderator Election is now underway!

Community moderator elections have three phases:


Nomination phase
Primary phase
Election phase


Most elections take between two and three weeks, but this depends how many candidates there are.

Please visit the official election page at

https://apple.stackexchange.com/electionhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/election

for more detail, and to participate!

If you have general questions about the election process, or questions for moderator candidates, feel free to ask them here on meta -- just make sure your questions are tagged /questions/tagged/electionelection.

What are the down sides to allowing 'volume' to be used both ways?  If am looking for audio-style volume, then I can search for 'volume'.  Then I see that it is ambiguous when I see the results, and I add another tag "audio" to further limit the scope.  I hope it's not a knee-jerk reaction that a tag should not have two different but specific meanings (think homonym)

In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Town Hall Chat session with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.  I am working with the candidates to find a time that allows the most participation.

The Town Hall Chat will take place Wednesday the 2nd at 2am UTC, or 9pm EST on the 1st.

Here are the details so far:


I have coordinated with the candidates and done the best I could with a best fit match. I would like to schedule this towards the beginning of the election phase, so I am looking at the 28th-3rd.  As soon as I coordinate with the existing moderators and candidates, I will edit this post with details on the "when".
The Town Hall Chat will be a one-hour event using our http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&sort=active&host=apple.stackexchange.comchat platform.  You can register for the event http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/322/ask-different-town-hall-chat?tab=schedulehere.
The format will be an open discussion.  Users are encouraged to pose questions to the candidate regarding their thoughts on moderation.
After the chat session, the transcript and a summary will be available.

With the developer preview of Lion available and the customer seed program in action, I imagine that we're going to start seeing questions about the upcoming Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.

Since all the previewers are bound by an NDA, how far are we going to allow discussion to go on this site?
For example, is it okay to share or ask for a workaround for a bug or a trick/hack for some cool functionality?
Will we allow questions in the vein of 'Will it do this or this?'

It's simple:


Is the question about something available to the public?
Is the question about something that has been officially announced?


If the answer to both these questions is "No," the question should be closed asap.

No rumors, no speculation, and no discussions—that's what keeps this site different from everywhere else, and what makes it work. There are enough places online for chit chat; anyone who wants that can easily find it elsewhere.

However, while I do agree that questions about unreleased functionality should be discouraged, it should not be because it's under NDA (which we have no obligation to enforce), but because it may be subject to change prior to release, making the answers potentially incorrect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would also note that this a beta (or perhaps worse) and thus anything that is true now could be different in the public version and thus we should close questions re Lionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle - you say we have no obligation to enforce but Hackintosh questions http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9562/install-os-x-on-windows-pc are closed because " off topic due to the violation of the Apple EULA"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark and Dori and Kyle... So, should hackintosh questions be closed? I would expect that it depends on the same points Dori just pointed here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Cawas: I would assume her first point could be said with an implied word left out: "...something LEGALLY available to the public." Creating a hackintosh violates the terms of the EULA you entered into when you bought OS/X, at which point you fail that check. (or you downloaded it illegally, again, failing that check.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cabbey I see... But using jailbreak also violates the EULA as far as I can tell, but those questions aren't closed. Maybe I should open a question about this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5hmm, I thought I had seen a couple of them get closed. But then there's also a (US) judge's ruling that jailbreaking isn't illegal and doesn't violate the EULA. It is actually a protected form of hacking for interoperability. (at least for now, here in the US.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dori - I have flagged several Lion questions and all remain open. It seems pretty clear you are advocating for closing them as well as purging comments that obviously relate to non-publicly available information that Apple has released on Lion. Not a huge deal - but the site isn't reflecting the "No rumors, no speculation" since iOS 5 betas, iCloud, and Lion are certainly not yet available to the public.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll let the mods work (as a newcomer to SE - I don't know who they are - how to find them - and must assume they work behind the scenes to clean up the flags I have put) I just assumed you were a mod based on reputation score - but it appears there is another list somewhere I'm not aware of.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike (& @Dori): I think there are two issues here regarding the consistency (or lack thereof) you see in how Lion questions are handled. The first is simply keeping up with the volume of questions and all of their nuances. I, as a moderator, rely on the community (probably a bit too heavily) to flag things since my time spent here is sporadic so I focus on particular topics. The second reason I see is that not all questions about Lion are about Lion itself  but rather about software running on Lion. That skirts the edges of this site's scope, and I prefer to err on the side of caution by...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... leaving the question in place in case a viable answer is posted. I don't think this is something that has been heavily discussed amongst the mods, at least not to my knowledge since I really can't do online chat, so the other mods may have a different take on the issue. As for there being a list of the mods, I'm not sure the SE sites have a publicly available list, but we do have one in the mod sections, and I think it would be great if there was a list available so users know where to look. At the same time, all new questions posted to meta appear at the top left of the page like commentsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dori: I think I knew that at one point and just forgot.

Being intrinsically Apple-centric, why does apple.stackexchange.com not have a mobile view for my iPhone?

I would just point to the original be it by commenting or some other more official means to point a "duplicate" or "not original". I'm all in favor with cleaning and organizing but not much a fan of deleting.

This doesn't look like Apple!



The 'Answer Your Question' button overlaps the 'Notify' label and checkbox. To use this feature (I really use it) I need to turn CSS off. This sucks. Shouldn't a newline be added after this button, like on other Stack Exchange sites?

The fix will be in the next deployment.


















I like the idea. It might be something the moderators can put together to start with and then expand. Once there is enough episodes we could maybe have it featured on the blog.

The new "mobile" template, among other things, replaces the site logo with the name of the site in text. However, the Stack Exchange engine still thinks that this site is called "Apple", which results in users visiting Ask Different on their iPhones being served a page that looks nothing like Ask Different with the word "Apple" instead of the logo.

Another example of where "Apple" appears where "Ask Different" should be used is in the moderator election system message. I've changed it on the main site, but you can see here on the meta site that it says "Apple 2011 community moderator election" instead of "Ask Different 2011 community moderator election". 

To fix these issues, and to make sure that similar ones don't come up in the future, I request that the name of this site be changed to "Ask Different".

edit: some current examples:




b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please change name of site from "Apple" to "Ask Different"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5this should not be migrated to meta.sob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jeff OK, then can you provide a response to the request here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It does add to the cognitive load to see the URL different than the branding.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In Ask Different Chat, http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1491135#1491135 (2011-07-31, my first participation in chat) highlights the confusion that may be experienced by newcomers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Apple - Stack Exchange is that tiny asterisk …" — http://apple.stackexchange.com/aboutb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Apple Stack Exchange" and "Apple - Stack Exchange" in the FAQ … would this type of comment be better in [What should our FAQ contain?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/5/8546)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks Geoff.

Neat idea. We're looking at making a podcast where I work at the moment, so been doing lots of reading on the topic. Does anyone else here have experience at making podcasts?

Obviously there are quite a few Apple-centric podcasts out there, but I think an enthusiastic group like us would have a good chance at making a successful run at it.

Great thinking Kyle.

There are a lot of Apple podcasts out there, but they mostly are about talking about the latest news and rumors. Of course we'll do that too, but I think that we could really tap into the Q&A angle through the site here that would hopefully make the format a little different that most other shows.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle I have experience in music pre-post production and I'm a mid-pro Logic Pro user if you need a hand in that department.


















I would be down for contributing however you think you could use it. I have space to host assuming it wouldn't be hosted in SE's network, programming skills to contribute (I designed and maintained http://www.orangeloungeradio.com/Orange Lounge Radio's Podcast Updater and RSS Feed for years), I have a couple (ahem) Blue Microphones, and time to spare... maybe :).

My webhost measures in system resource utilization in preference to bandwidth. I'm sure excessive abusers are kicked off, but I'm not at that point yet :). I have some room to play too, in the form of a second location I can play with, and a virtual server (that I don't call production ready, but can leverage in a pinch).


















Here's what I'm thinking so far. Any and all of this can be changed if necessary:

Communication:

Skype

Tests will have to be done to see if the audio quality on the other end of a Skype call is sufficient for the podcast. if not, then each participant will need to record with Ecamm and the tracks will be combined afterward



Live Broadcast/Chat:

Justin.TV/UStream
Ask Different chat

Format:

Introduction
Site news

i.e. moderator elections, new Stack Exchange features, etc


Followup/listener feedback
Main topic

It might be nice for each show to have a theme ("backups", "using iOS with Linux", etc) that we could talk about for a bit. I've (Kyle) found that the podcasts I enjoy and listen to the most are the ones I learn from. And given that this is a Q&A site, we should have an endless source of information to use.


App of the Week

Doesn't have to be every week, but if there's a notable app that's come out or that one of us has discovered, we can do a bit on it


Question of the Week

We highlight a question asked within the last week that's interesting and/or insightful


Wrap up

Distribution/Hosting

Posterous ( http://podcast.askdifferent.net/http://podcast.askdifferent.net/ )
Feedburner ( http://feeds.feedburner.com/AskDifferentPodcast/http://feeds.feedburner.com/AskDifferentPodcast/ )

License

same CC license as the site

It would be nice to be an "official" podcast so that we can use "Ask Different" and "Stack Exchange" in the name and/or description without qualifying it with "community" or "unofficial"

It sounds like most of it is sketched out but it's down to making it happen.


















When I'm editing a post, one of the most common things that I end up doing* is fixing the capitalization of the names Apple's products, like in this question's title.

How would people feel about automatically changing all instances of 'iname' or 'Iname' to 'iName'?
I don't imagine that SE has this functionality built in, so consider this a feature request.

*I don't feel compelled to edit posts just to fix product name capitalization, but I do it if I'm in the neighborhood/

They won't drop this entity until John Sculley takes over Apple again.


















I think in the short term, a userscript would be wonderful for this.

And in the long term, it's a great customization for the site, perhaps even the network as a whole. And it's really just a fixed set of strings.

iMac, iPhone, iPod, iPad, MacMini, MacPro, Mac OSX, and ummm, a few more :). The latter half of those are less "Special" than the iSeries are.

The other SE sites have a little arrow that points to the right, or down if you've expanded the reputation activity for that date, just to the left of the date. But the Apple.SE site is missing this arrow:

Hi all, as you might have noticed, I made some design tweaks to the site.

Here's the before and after comparison.



The most obvious change is the removal of the 2-tone dark background colors. The other changes are minor, mostly text and link colors changes to go with the new lighter background color.

There are a few reasons why I made the design changes:

1) The old 2-tone background design was pretty painful to implement in CSS. I had to write a lot more extra CSS hacks to get the pages to look right. Even then, some pages still didn't look nice because of the HTML structure. The old design caused the CSS file to be very bloated and hard to maintain, also it's not easily adaptable for new site features/pages in the future.

2) In the old design I used quite a bit of CSS3 elements for the parent container, this caused some browser performance issues(namely scrolling smoothness in Firefox and Safari).



3) The old design was inspired by iOS Apps look. After the site launched, I felt the dark backgrounds made the site a bit too boxy. Dark trims work on an iOS device because screen size is fixed. I've been looking at the new OSX Lion UI elements and I think they're better fitted for a web site design. 

Of course, the new changes may have produced a few newer glitches. Mostly likely text colors. Please let me know if you see any(start a new post please). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some design changesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Love. It.

Hope it's not an April that will disappear tomorrow ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Loïc I promise you it's not an April Fools Day joke! I love doing CSS, but not THAT much.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Beautiful. And faster, I think. Sweet. Thanks so much for continuing to put so much work into the site, @Jin.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Jin, absolutely gorgeous. Great ideas, thanks for the update! If I could donate rep I would.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice work man I have scrolling smoothness problem with last CSS3 design but now the problem was solved :D


















The "Lion" redesign removed a lot of the weirder CSS3 on this site; see if that helps!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ye it's become better, I don't have any of the previous problem, But I must add this that I upgrade my firefox to firefox 4 too, when I have problem with Ask Different I use firefox 3. Tanx anyway


















The corners of the search box (After the redesign) looks weird on Chrome 10/OS X:

But apparently it hasn't. http://paulirish.com/2011/chrome-inset-box-shadow-bug-fixed/ I'll look into other solutions. If the css method fails, I'll remove it and use a bg image instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Yes, I was looking at your twitter post. According to that, it *should* be already fixed in our versions. (it reports 10.0.628.0) as the fixed version, and latest stable (Mac) is 10.0.648.204, which should be newer? :Sb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@M I'm waiting for a response from Paul Irish(who originally reported the fix) on Twitter http://bit.ly/dEzo2V I may have to use a bg image instead until this is REALLY fixed. I've been avoiding using an image because that's an extra server request...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin I have experimented with the "fix" but couldn't make it work. However, you should *never* trust me on CSS stuff. C#? Objective-C? Yes. CSS? no ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can anyone comment on whether this is fixed or reproduced?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's fixed (at least in the lastest chrome version at the time) Version 29.0.1547.76


















Buttons are inconsistent.

Now, answering this question, one answer exists. I can sort answers by "Active", "Oldest", or "Votes". The selected button appears slightly more active, and the deselected a bit inactive, which makes sense, but this is secondary to the primary visual which is that the selected button pops out, and the unselected buttons are pressed in. This is counter-intuitive. The selected button is usually pressed in.

Again, on the main page, "Questions, Tags, Users, Badges..." has the active button pressed in, but just below that "Newest, Featured, FAQ, Votes..." buttons are the opposite. The selected button looks popped out.

In short: I'm confused which UI elements are selected and which are not.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When you have 3 options, and one of them stands out, and they are mutually exclusive options, logic stands to reason that the one that stands out is the active option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mankoff then you're going to *love* Lion (sarcasm) ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VxJ OK, out/in doesn't matter, but it should still be consistent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where isn't it consistent? (I'm not disagreeing with you, I just haven't noticed.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Questions, Tags, Users, Badges..." is Active when In. "Newest, Featured, FAQ, Votes..." is Active when Out. You have to be in list view, not viewing a specific question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, you can see it here too. Categories up top are indented, vs. comment ordering (active, oldest, votes) are bubbled. I see what you mean, but I still don't think this is really an issue. The "pages" items (Questions, Tags, Users) change where you are. Where the slider style (active, oldest, votes) only changes the order of the content. They're two entirely different "widgets", and they serve two entirely different purposes. Why should they look identical?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5identical != consistent.

I've added syntax highlight for the tags you mentioned. It may take a little time to figure out which language to use for AppleScript, and which language is most common for 'script'.

Feel free to comment if there's a problem.

This has been covered numerous times previously; the most thorough being the MSO post, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answersAre answers that just contain links elsewhere really "good answers"?
Short version: it's a really bad idea.
A link isn't an answer; it's just a pointer to a possible answer. With no context, someone seeing just a link doesn't know if it might be on-topic, off-topic, a joke, or spam. Even a little bit of context helps make it clear why the link is worth following.
Additionally, answers here should be for the long term. If someone has the same problem two years from now, the link that's currently to a great blog post may well later be a 404 (or worse). If the link was the entire answer, then Apple.SE no longer has an answer for the question.
Link-only answers should be flagged as what they are: not answers.

Editing would prevent the link appearing multiple times on the same Q&A, but then again it *might* generate false-reputation for the link's provider. (But isn't the Stack Exchange about quality and community rather than rep?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5we've already seen link-only answers become useless on SO a bunch of times when the underlying link starts to 404. So you really do need to insist that answers contain a relevant excerpt that is *the answer*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What did I oversee on flagging this answer? The flag was declined, I'd like to avoid wrong flagging, but would have seen this as link only answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The same question would fit for this answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/92701/55266


















Sometimes I see a question that, when seen from the homepage, appears to have no title. You can still click its box and go to the question's page, where the title is visible.

We're evaluating the feasibility of sponsoring a member of the Apple community to speak at a conference in 2011.

Speaking is a relatively big "ask", so this needs to be planned many months in advance. Let's get started! 

We'd like the community to establish where ...


  What relevant Apple conferences are coming up in 2011 that have open speaker slots or calls for papers?


... and then who.


  Which members of the community are strongly interested in being sponsored by Stack Exchange, Inc to speak at one of the above conferences in 2011?


To be clear, the speaker is free talk about anything he or she wants so long as it would be roughly on topic for this site -- with a quick acknowledgement of support from Stack Exchange and a mention of the community here.

Yes, you can ask them, as long as they're not related to something illegal, like pirating apps, etc.

Many hardware questions are really improved by knowing the exact model but that is really hard to manage. It sure would be good to at least demarcate the huge hardware differences between a unibody portable and a non-unibody model.

The battery care and lifespans are drastically different. General assumptions on graphics, chipsets and motherboard features can be generalized better with more detail on the models.

Just a thought and a request to consider those tags to help the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would someone add "unibody" and "non-unibody" tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Question: what kind of questions would be tagged *only* "unibody"? Or *only* "non-unibody"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would really help a question about MacBook batteries. It would be obvious if it was removable or non-user servicable. If would help with glass trackpad, port locations, video out connector type, SD card slot availability just to name a few more differences.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Describing* the issue should be in the question itself. Tags *define* and *categorize* the question, ie. question tagged "unibody" should be a question about the unibody, not e.g. battery. "macbook-unibody" could be an option, but are unibodies from 2008 and 2010 comparable? Should there be a "macbook-2010" tag? Or both? IMO just "unibody" is ambiguous and "non-unibody" plain wasteful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - the unibodies are far more comparable than they are different. That's why having that one distinction adds much more value than simply tagging every hardware model that gets bumped yearly. Of course - I much prefer the exact details being added or edited, but the value of tags is to distill and categorize for easy searching and clarification.

This question was asked before I realized tags are edited collaboratively by everyone that has reached a certain level and not something hard coded. I was going to close it, but leave that for someone else to decide. Perhaps others will have the same question as a newcomer to SE. I've known about the sites for a long time, but decided to step up and participate when an apple site was made.

I'll go through some of the best questions that I feel merit these tags and start tagging. We'll see where it goes based on the views of people that can edit and reassign tags...

I don't see any objection to a tag "iOS 4.2.1" or "iOS 4.2" or "iOS 4" - why would you eliminate a specific tag just because other questions are better tagged with a more general tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I now see how bad the micro tags are 4.2.1 and 4.2 but didn’t appreciate how large and long tags are but a few years moderating showed me how little I knew about running these sites when I posted here. Thanks @JeffAtwood for the guidance here.


















There are specific tags for iPhone 4, iPhone 3gs, iPhone 3g, but why not the original iPhone? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What tag should I use for a question about the original iPhone?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps because the original iPhone was simply called the "iPhone"? I suppose an [iphone-2g] tag could be used if it must be explicitly defined.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did end up using the iphone tag, but I observed it is also used on many iphone questions that are not regarding the original iphone.  It feels more like an "any kind of iphone" tag as opposed to an "original v1 iphone" tag.  And since the procedures and software used for popular tasks like jailbreaking are different and have different limitations on the original iphone, it would seem to merit its own tag


















List questions, such as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5435/terminal-tips-and-tricks-for-mac-os-xTerminal Tips and Tricks for Mac OS X and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricksMac OS X hidden features and nice tips & tricks tend to be quite popular, and making them community wiki removes the incentive to gain massive reputation by creating one. It seems that the question you mention was mistaken for one of these types of questions - even the title seems to suggest that the author intended to create a list-type question.

However, upon reading the actual question, it's obvious that that was not the author's question at all, so I've unwiki'd the question and answers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The title is a little confusing; when I first read it, I thought the question was asking for a list of all the terminal commands, and I read the answers just to see which commands they would list. I proposed a title edit for that question, trying to match it with what the question is really asking.


















Cross posting is discouraged because questions can be migrated, and a cross-post will lead to a duplicate question, which the community, in turn, also discourages.

I have never seen an online community where cross-posting was acceptable.

Someone recently asked the following question:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13479/radeon-5730m-on-windows-xpRadeon 5730m on Windows XP

Hey all,
I've recently installed Windows XP SP3 32bit onto my iMac via Boot Camp - I'm having some trouble getting graphics drivers for the included 5730m card though - appears official support is limited to Vista upwards.
(I'm aware the card is published as a 5670 I believe, but research shows it's a 5730m card marked up as such to demonstrate the performance)
Does anyone know of a third party/open driver that would work on XP for this?

The question...

Is about hardware running under Windows (the fact that it's in an Apple computer is incidental)
Is not about Boot Camp -- he says Windows is already installed
Hasn't received a response here in 24 hours

I thought it was obvious that this should be migrated to Super User simply as "Does anyone know of a Windows XP driver for a Radeon 5730m video card?" -- but that suggestion has sparked a bit of a debate in the question's comments.  Your thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Question about a Windows driver -- here or Super User?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For me this is very much a SU question. I agree the Apple-ness of this is purely incidental.


















This is an interesting situation. Questions about Boot Camp drivers are on topic, but in this case it seems that the user wants to use an older version of Windows that's not supported. The question isn't really off topic per se so I'm going to leave it, but then again it may be beneficial for the user to cross post to Super User as they have more experience with Windows drivers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the input, Kyle.  I didn't realize that cross-posting could be preferable to migrating a question.  And I don't want to belabor the point, but I would argue that "Boot Camp drivers", especially *after initial installation* are essentially just *Windows* drivers.  Ultimately, the user is looking for a `.sys` driver designed for Windows that they will install within Windows using the Windows Device Manager.  A Mac-oriented community would have no special insights (and in fact, would likely know less than others) about this topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Austin True. But there's a bit of a difference between encouraging someone to ask their question somewhere else and forcibly migrating it, even if it might help them get an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Understood -- thanks for the clarification!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like Kyle's answer, but only to the point of cross-posting. Since the question straddles the line between on and off-topic, it should be given a chance to be answered here first. Then if in a week or so nothing fruitful appears, it then get migrated to SU. But I feel cross-posting shouldn't be encouraged since we can easily migrate questions to more appropriate locations; I've never seen cross-posting being acceptable on any online forum.


















I would say yes, they are on topic. It has been my intention that the scope of this site would involve all aspects of Apple products, and I don't see any reason why fink, ports, or homebrew should be excepted.

Again, like the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/513/question-about-a-windows-driver-here-or-super-userquestion about a Windows driver, this is not to say that there aren't other sites on the network where the question may also be asked, or where they may even receive a better answer. But those aren't reason enough, in my opinion, to remove them from the scope of this site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Here is another I would call off topic - http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/18400/5472 - I can't see how letting some ports questions which are all in essence how to compile unix code using gcc as in scope. Ports are command line details at worst, at best it's equivalent how you do work inside Xcode. I think these should be off topic unless extraordinarily superficial and tie into a consumer need. (say like you need mac pets to get one popular ffmpeg code library installed to make handbrake work - I would expect new user, cookbook ports questions to be mildly on-topic here)


















I'd like to personally apologize for some of my word and term transpositions in this episode. And I'd also like to personally thank Kyle for putting up with my sniffles, coughs, and all the rest. He did a really great job of filtering all that stuff out to make a much better listening experience!

I blame sickness :). It's a worthwhile scapegoat.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://images.icanhascheezburger.com/completestore/2008/9/2/escapegoatis128648410209322532.jpgb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5^^ ROLF!!! Very appropriate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not in here, mister. This is a Mercedes.


















Some people asking troubleshooting questions here (mainly those who are not SO or SU veterans) aren't aware that there's certain basic information they should provide, or that there are a few basic troubleshooting steps they should often try before asking for help -- at least so they can say "I've already tried this, this, and this".
Here are a few recent examples:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13841/computer-boots-up-and-fades-to-blue-repeatedlycomputer boots up and fades to blue repeatedly
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13279/macbook-shutdown-problemMacbook Shutdown Problem
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11158/why-cant-i-send-my-files-to-the-trashWhy can't I send my files to the Trash?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11140/starcraft-2-update-crashStarcraft 2 update crash
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10613/how-to-know-imac-crash-reasonhow to know imac crash reason
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8653/system-preferences-crashes-when-press-accountsSystem preferences crashes when press accounts

I'm not saying these don't belong here.  Personally, I think this community is good at providing answers to these questions -- once enough details have been provided.
But on questions like these, it is common to see comments (or even answers!) like...

What are your system specs?
What version of OS X are you running?
Have you checked for error messages in the Console?
Have you tried _ _ _ _ _ (repairing permissions | zapping the PRAM | performing voodoo)?

Being a programmer, I'm a big proponent of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourselfDRY principle, and I don't like the thought of continuously re-inventing the wheel when answering these questions.  It also makes for messy, lower-quality questions.
And as this community matures and "everyday" Mac users find out about the site, I would guess that questions like this will become more common.
Do you think it would be helpful to create a few community wikis that provide basic troubleshooting tips?  Or templates for asking troubleshooting questions -- a la https://stackapps.com/questions/7/how-to-list-your-application-library-wrapper-script-hereStackApps' guidelines for listing an app?  Then, instead of playing "comment ping-pong" with everyone who asks a question lacking helpful details, we could direct them to the appropriate wiki to help them refine their question.
I am not suggesting we create vast "manuals" that all users are required to read before posting, but it would be helpful to have some guidelines for troubleshooting questions.
Personally, I would like to be able to say in a comment: "Try the few, basic troubleshooting steps outlined [here], and if you still have problems, please edit your question to provide the basic information from [this template]."
I would take the initiative to make a "first draft" of such resources myself, but if this idea has support, I think there should be some discussion about the implementation -- especially since I am relatively new to the SE sites and am not as familiar with how (or if) this has been addressed on the other sites.
(Not to mention the fact that I'm sure I'm not the leading expert on general system troubleshooting in this community.)  ;]
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Community wiki resources for troubleshooting questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I struggle with that as a somewhat new participant here. Is basic troubleshooting even on-topic for this site? Why would someone want to come here instead of the official Apple Support resources? I personally see this site as being excellent if it doesn't try to replicate content that already exists on the web but instead covers things the manufacturer resources can not or will not allow on their discussion boards or official support documentation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I was going to ask if basic troubleshooting was on-topic in a separate meta question, but then I felt silly asking because the FAQ allows hardware and software questions and doesn't mention troubleshooting among its prohibitions.  It would be nice to get some mods' opinions on that, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike And if "basic troubleshooting" were prohibited, where would you draw the line?  How would one concretely determine that a question was "too basic" to troubleshoot here?  From my experience, most people can improve their low-quality troubleshooting questions with more specific details when prompted (one reason for the wikis I proposed above).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like how you think. Imagine how contentious and argumentitave a quabble over the best way to generally troubleshoot an issue might get when it's hard enough to agree on answers to one specific but vaguely worded question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Austin - why not try answering this with a first draft? I took a tilt in a comment on this question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6644/recent-emails-not-fetched-on-iphone-4 - let's see how that wording goes in this one case.


















I don't see how technically worded questions about how low level OS processes work is necessarily a bad thing. Running Mac OS X on non mac hardware seems to be equally against Apple's published licensing terms as is jailbreaking an iOS device. The legality of an action gets sorted out when a judge weighs all of the conflicting laws. The law starts to "solidify" when judges publish precedent and intentionally state that some rulings are to be considered broad rather than an isolated finding in some narrow case Moe vs. Larry 

Many questions here will fall in gray areas where there is no precedent but simply a bunch conflicting laws and hundreds of years of case history that may or may not apply to a shrink wrapped, non-negotiated, un-signed EULA between parties of radically unequal bargaining power. Add in the worldwide nature of this site and trying to set a bar based on one (or even a plurality of) jurisdiction(s) seems to make it extremely hard to say which if any set of laws should govern our attempts to control information. 

Discussing darwin open source OS and how Mac OS X differs isn't guaranteed to be legal in all places or situations, but exercising prior restraint of discussion on how things work seems quite draconian for a site that intends to be a collection of knowledge. 

I'm not going to pretend that everyone asking these questions is a university researcher, but would we turn the same away if they wanted to discuss things here that are in fact legal and/or ethical in the eyes of professionals?

The plus side of not blanket banning these is:


Assume that people with intelligent, answerable questions will do just that
Reinforces the trust given to http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/our human exception handlers to handle bad questions in this area just like they do with all other bad questions.


If our moderators are letting us know 


The vast majority of these questions are worthless
They can't keep up with proper work due to the load of culling these bad questions


I think it's too soon to tell if a ban discussion is worth having. We don't know yet what good might be thrown out with the bad.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice post, nice 2009 blog post. Now, as then: amongst the presets for flagging, the word *legal* does not appear. Without sailing elsewhere for answers/comments (I don't plan to travel so far), I guess that the absence of the word does not signal carelessness. To me: its absence simply means that any Stack Exchange site in public beta, or beyond, includes **moderators who have skills** appropriate for dealing with **each post on its merit**. Moreover, the Stack Exchange approach to collaborative edition etc. should make **very** rare any need for moderation that is *complex* or *contentious*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not particularly interested in whether a particular practice is legal in any particular jurisdiction (as long as the *discussion* thereof doesn't get this site shut down). That which is off-topic is off-topic because we chose to make it off-topic. I want the community to arbitrate what question they want to answer; what a particular jurisdiction permits the residents thereof to do is utterly irrelevant.


















If both questions were on Ask Different then, yes, they're similar enough that one would likely be closed as a duplicate of the other. However, in this case, as the two questions are on separate sites, it's not possible to close one as a duplicate of the other.

Even though the two sites are in the same network, Ask Different functions completely separately from Super User, which means that some content duplication is not only inevitable but desirable, as it means that people won't have to search all across the network for answers to their questions.

With that in mind, I hope that in the event that you notice duplicate questions here on Ask Different that you will continue to let moderators know.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That clears it up -- thanks, Kyle!


















I created another user account on my computer, and visited Ask Different. I logged in using the same username I normally use (and I am using now), but despite I used the same ClaimID OpenID account, it shows me as https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/6434/kiamlalunouser6474.

I tried from my other Mac, using the similar user account I have on my Mac Mini, but I am still logged in as user6474.

To show that it's an account to which I have access, I am going to rename the account, and use kiamlaluno also on the new account.

Update: I tried logging in on Stack Overflow from the other computer, and it reports the following message:


  This OpenID is new to Stack Overflow:
  ClaimID (kiamlaluno)
  
  However, it is know to 1 other sites in the Stack Exchange Network


To try logging in on Stack Overflow, I have used Google Chrome, instead of Safari, and I don't understand why I get that message.
I should not see that message, as I am using the same OpenID account I am using on this computer. I don't understand the reason why SE thinks it's a new account when I use it from a different computer and a different local user account.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Ask Different" logged me in with a different accountb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course, I could not add the email address, as it's the same I am already using for my normal account.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I updated the user profile link, as it was not correct anymore, since I have set kiamlaluno as showed name. I still have to understand why using a different Mac account to log in on SE would cause any problem, but that is what happens.


















Hm, from what I can tell they really are both using the same OpenID. This is likely a bug in Stack Exchange. If you're looking to regain access to your original account, I suggest using https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/account-recoveryemail account recovery for the time being.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't work; it reports me the ClaimID account I am using, and then tells me to log in, but I am still being logged in with the wrong account. I will try deleting any cookies on the other computer, to see if it works.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kiamlaluno If that doesn't work, there are basically two options - you can contact the SE team directly (team+apple@stackexchange.com) and see what they can do for you, or I can merge your old account into your new account.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will try contacting them; you could merge the accounts, but I could still have the same problem when I try to log in from the other computer. I will try to copy the cookies between the accounts, if there is a way to do that on a Mac. Thank you for helping.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle Cronin It seems I have resolved my issue; may you delete the account #6434?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kiamlaluno OK, doneb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle Cronin Thank you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the issue is that claimid supports two forms of their OpenID -- they are not the same from our perspective, they are different strings. You can search meta.so for more detail, etc



















You should answer the question in the way that you feel is most appropriate. If you want to resolve the XY Problem that you see in the question, then do so. In an effort to handle any misguided downvotes, you will want to make clear your intent to try and avoid any misunderstanding. Some people just want their question answered at face value (as in the OP to the given question), and they'll probably downvote you for it whether you like it or not, but that is all part of the gamble we take by asking and answering when there is a rep system.
There is really not much more than what you describe that can be done. In other words, the community has spoken with the tools it has been given.
In this instance I would vote up the answers that I like, and leave the rest alone. Downvotes are yours to use as you see fit, but I generally save downvotes for answers that are clearly wrong or misleading. I see that answer that you downvoted was none of those things on face value (no matter how misguided).

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your input!  Regarding your point #3: `I generally save downvotes for answers that are clearly wrong or misleading. I see that answer that you downvoted was none of those things on face value`  That's *precisely* the problem to which I am referring.  The OP specifically said that he wanted to protect his email from being read, and that answer protects *only* the app (poorly) and *not* the email data -- so the way I see it, it is very "misleading".  Most people will not realize this "on face value".  ::sigh::b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, is there any acceptable method of bringing extra attention to a "questionable" question?  Is this something that should be done in the form of a question about the question on meta?  I assume using the chat on Ask Different would be acceptable, but it seems to be very sparsely populated.  Would it be appropriate to post in the chat on *other* SE sites about it (e.g. Security SE, in this case, to ask for the opinions of UNIX security gurus who otherwise might never visit this site)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Austin: To your first comment, now I see what you're saying there. So, in that case, yes I would agree with the downvote. For both points, I would say the best way would be to comment about the question (or just answer it) to get the OP to change the question or, in extreme questions, flag it for a moderator to take a look at it.


















This is the third episode of the Ask Different Podcast, an unofficial podcast created by members of the Ask Different community about Apple and related technologies.

Your hosts this week are https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/13/kyle-croninKyle Cronin, https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1346/vxjasonxvJason Salaz, and https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/2220/nathanNathan Greenstein.


Kyle begins with some news about this podcast: We’ve launched! We want to thank everyone that has sent us feedback, we appreciate it. Also, we’re now featured on the http://blog.superuser.com/category/podcasts/askdifferent/Super User Blog. 
Nathan describes Stack Exchange’s http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/vote-for-this-question-or-the-kitten-gets-it/recent efforts to boost voting on questions, especially relative to answers. Verdict: if you see a great question on Ask Different, vote it up!
Jason discusses LastPass’ recent http://blog.lastpass.com/2011/05/lastpass-security-notification.htmlpossible security breach, what this means, how LastPass is responding, and what users of the service should do as a result. Jason also brings us a correction to a previous episode regarding which features are available in the free vs paid plans.
Nathan updates us with http://news.consumerreports.org/electronics/2011/05/apples-white-iphone-is-not-thicker-than-black-version.htmlhard data about the white iPhone 4’s alleged width gain, and discusses whether or not the color of the  actually makes a difference.
Kyle delivers an iPhone tracking update: http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/oIa9Cxxbo7E/ios-433-is-out-with-location-tracking-fixes-for-iphone-ipad.arsOfficial iOS update released. What it changes, and how it helps you stay more secure. Jason discusses Apple’s impressive response to the tracking issue.
We discuss the fact that, while Android phones are more popular than the iPhone, the iPad is much more popular than the slew of available Android tablets. Do Android and iOS tablet customers expect different things from their tablets? Are the iPad’s main advantages timing and price?
Nathan takes us through the http://www.macworld.com/article/159611/2011/05/thunderbolt_imacs.htmlrecent upgrades to the iMac line, we discuss if it’s worth getting the 21-inch model, and whether or not the two Thunderbolt ports on the 27-inch model eliminate most of the need for a Mac Pro.
Kyle compares how (relatively) easy it is to http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Repair/iMac-Intel-27-Inch-Hard-Drive-Replacement/1634/1service the newer iMacs compared with the older http://www.flickr.com/photos/magistermgp/sets/72157610300582836/iMac G3 and http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/systems/iMac_g4/imacg4_takeapart.htmliMac G4.
We share some tips on how to get Spotlight to work for you, including excluding certain directories and http://viewer.zoho.com/api/urlview.do?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhints.macworld.com%2Fdlfiles%2Fspotlight_cmds.pdfsearch paramaters (pdf) based on the file metadata.
Our Question of the Week was asked by https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/6212/carlosCarlos: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13383/snow-leopard-server-as-main-everyday-osSnow Leopard Server as main (everyday) OS, and we discuss whether it’s a good idea to run desktop apps on a server.
Our App of the Week is http://www.andreasilliger.com/Tiny Wings, a game for iPhone and iPad where you play as a bird and try to fly as far as you can before the sun sets. Tiny Wings is available on the http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tiny-wings/id417817520?mt=8&affId=1936001&ign-mpt=uo%3D4App Store.

I've queued up a new post for this episode, but it's up to the people that are running the blog when they'll publish it.

J/K :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Martín As this is supposed to be a podcast about the Ask Different community, I'd very much like your input - what we're doing right, suggestions for improvement, recommendations for app of the week/question of the week, maybe even a few questions we could answer 'on air'. We do definitely plan on getting guests on in the near future, but we need to sort out a few things on the production end first (it's still very chaotic and unorganized).

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(Unofficial) StackExchange WWDC Meet Up — 7th June, 2011b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see an edit link below this post, and that "Dirsections" typo above is mocking me...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we do this again this year?


















It's  the first time I've noticed this on a SE site but I guess it applies not only to Apple.SE. 

On pages where the contents load relatively slowly (e.g. sometimes,  https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/usersthe "Users" page) there is a noticeable Flash of when the page is built, and at some point gets a vertical scroll bar. The page's contents move 16px to the left once the scroll bar is added.

It's a minor thing, but noticeable. I would consider using overflow-y: auto in order to force a scroll bar, whether there is need for one or not. It would make for a smoother browsing experience.

Bumping this, as it still happens.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Layout should use overflow-y: scroll to prevent flickeringb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Funnily enough, this *might* be a Windows-only problem - I can't for the life of me remember how OS X displays scroll bars. It should be fixed anyway IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does it happen in all your browser?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Loïc No. I see the flicker only in Chrome 10. IE shows a disabled scroll bar by default; FF removes the scrollbar when it doesn't need it, but does that more smoothly.


















Indeed this should have happened, but a bug in the migration overhaul last week means it didn't, it will be fixed in the next build, and I've cleaned up those votes that shouldn't have made it over on that specific post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you so much for the explanation and the fix :-)


















I disagree that this is a problem, personally. Yes they're consistent, but contextually they flow well. Vote up? Above the vote counter. Vote down? Below the vote counter. And subscribing to the question is "extra" or "additional", naturally placed below the rest of the tools.

And, the Facebook and Twitter buttons follow the same flow, however they ARE visually distinct (smaller and colorful).

Is there a specific idea you have in mind of a different style for these buttons?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not saying the vote up/down & favorite buttons should be moved around... their position is fine, I think it's just that they are all round buttons. The "up, 5, down" controls in stackoverflow feel much more tight to me. Maybe removing the round buttons behind the icons might work. It helps a little that facebook & twitter have some color to them, but a) I think it makes the controls feel bottom-heavy, and b) speaking of context, I don't think that's the right spot for tweeting and liking on facebook. Just my 2 cents.


















I have updated the 404 image with the sad Mac one. It will be in the next deployment.

I'm not colorblind, but these bubbles from the reputation summary / recent changes page are really pushing the envelope into "fugly". Could someone here have a word with the designers and see if they meant to enact this change?

Even yellow/purple or orange/blue is better for people that are colorblind if you really want to use contrasting / opposing colors for this...


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's up with the red on green bubbles?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This was not intended. We're fixing it.


















This was my fault for assuming the text was white already on the other SE sites when adding this styling.  https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/6/jinJin pushed a CSS update so that the text on these is now white everywhere, it should look much better now.

Edit - it looks MUCH better - so happy it was an oops (and a minor one at that.) Speedy fix FTW.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks Nick. I'll be tweaking the green to each site's proper green shade this weekend. For now, white text helps as a quick fix.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very impressed by the speed of resolution. Thanks again to both of you, the apple site colors are very well done. Thanks @nick-craver and @jin

However, it appears that you're now at 111 rep here as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yeah, I guess I was being too impatient :)


















We recently printed some business cards for our Stack Exchange employees and they turned out great.

It got us thinking: our sites' moderators have been working hard to keep our sites high quality for the past few years. They may not be employees, per se, but great community moderators are why our communities are safe, sane, and worth visiting in the first place…

If you're a moderator on the main site, would you be interested in having your own Ask Different contact card? Would you find it useful?

I can see them being handy to pass out during your local meetups or conferences.

Below is a mockup:

I don't see a lot of questions (or answers) about Final Cut Pro X on the Apple Stack Exchange, and want to do something about that.



If you:


regularly do video editing 
regularly participate in Ask Different
don't yet have a copy of Final Cut Pro X
would use one if you got it
would ask and answer questions about Final Cut Pro X on Ask Different 


please answer this question. Early this week we will be sending out free, fully-licensed copies to the first 5 people who qualify.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not a lot of final cut pro questions here...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't do video editing regularly, but I do occasionally. I would certainly ask and answer on Ask Different. In the unlikely event of there not being better-qualified people, I'm here :-).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do video editing quite frequently (in school), but haven't got to try any software beyond iMovie. I would definitely ask questions, the software already looks difficult to use :/.
On a side note, take a look at [this article on CNET](http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20074064-248/conan-obrien-rips-apples-final-cut-pro-x-on-show/) and [this article on NYTimes](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/professional-video-editors-weigh-in-on-final-cut-pro-x/). There seems that there is a lot of criticism about itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nathan It might be nice to do a segment about it on the podcastb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd speculate that why we don't see questions about FCP here is because it's a specialized application one can build a career around. This is kind of like asking (though a bit reaching) for more Adobe inDesign questions for the Mac on Ask Different, but those questions are better suited over at Graphic Design due to its specialization and its community. I wonder if FCP questions and the surrounding issues are too specific or too deep for a general-use site like Ask Different, but I am all for more traffic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Philip It's an Apple product, so it's by definition on topic for this site. I'd love to get more in-depth, technical questions about it here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bckbck Per Joel's instructions, answer the question to throw your hat into the ring. The information in your comment makes you look like a perfect candidate (IMO).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VxJasonxV with absolutely no experience or skill in using FCP X.  I'd think that it would be better if there are some other people more suited for this, rather than me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bckbck But that is the point. You don't have to have experience or skill using FCP X, you just have to have a need to edit videos and own a Mac capable of running FCP X. You will be given a copy, you use it, and when you run into problems, ask about it here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VxJasonxV I'll wait and see. If there are no other worthy people, then i will post it as an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5this really belongs on the upcoming video site, I thinkb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle: I agree that FCP questions are technically on-topic for Ask Different, I'm just wondering how much traction they are really going to get even with this effort. Xcode is an highly specialized Apple product, but we don't get that many questions or answers about it directly. I'm not saying this is a bad idea, and is definitely worth a shot, but I just have a doubt the FCP community is going to follow along. Video-editing is a culture unto itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bckbck: I think you should answer with your comment anyway. You won't know unless you ask.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5bump...........b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I qualify? Or was this too long ago?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PhilipRegan Stack Overflow is a more suitable place for xCode and c+ developing. That is where I go for these answers and questions.


















I would be very happy to participate!

I have updated to the FAQ to include a line about not being able to ask about pre-release and beta software.

and it is not about ...

pre-release or beta software requiring a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to use


Lion and iOS 5 are due to be released, but still not, and the number of questions has gone up recently. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17366/disable-opening-pdfs-inline-in-safari-5-1There was a question recently where a couple of users expressed disappointment in not being able to ask Lion questions, and their comments got a few upvotes. We have been closing beta-related questions for a while, and we have never allowed discussion on installing Apple software on non-Apple hardware, so I don't this as really being a big deal to add.
Please let me know if the language is okay or if it needs to be made clearer. Either way, I feel that the beta policy needs to be made clear, and I would be interested to hear any objections to adding this as well.

Agreed; Apple is particularly strict about this, and since anything can change between beta and release it is better -- from an end user perspective -- to not allow it at all.

(I am more sympathetic to developers, who really do need to use and talk about this stuff as it is "final" for them much earlier.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Focusing solely on expressions *beta* and *pre-release*: Ask Different might need to restate — reword **without** using either of those expressions — the policy of **not discussing** pre-release software that is subject to a confidentiality agreement or **nondisclosure** agreement. Answers to meta [Despite the general rule to not answer questions about beta products, should we allow Messages on OSX and Siri on iPhone 4S questions?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/1119/8546) provoke thought. Also: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/1270/8546 concerning presence and removal of tags.


















I am wondering if in practice this community has enough people that visit in a 24 to 48 hour period to actually close questions.

Are there any questions that got closed due to an actual quorum of close votes and not via a binding vote by a moderator?

Just curious - things are working well since we have awesome mods - at what point does a site have enough people for the mods to not be needed for all the closing action.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the community (mid 2011) large enough to close questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. We have a patient zero candidate.

http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/31171/what-is-a-good-use-for-my-old-powerpc-mac


















Yes and no.

When going by the rep threshold of 3000 needed to cast close votes, then we only have 12 (twelve) people who can effectively close a question without moderator intervention. But some of the names I haven't seen active on the boards for a while. At the same time, it only takes a rep of 15 to flag a post for moderator attention, so that gives people the power of voting by extension. Going by that logic, the answer then is "yes" but only as long as we have proactive users willing to participate beyond simply asking and answering questions.

Stack Exchange is the only place where I have extensive experience and seen questions closed by voting, and even then it is pretty rare in the tags that I watch relative to the number of questions that get posted. The answer is then "no" when comparing how community sized between SE and Ask Different.

Therefore, I think the question then becomes: How do we encourage more Ask Different users to become proactive members of the community beyond the usual asking and answering questions? How do we become more community-driven than we already are now?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Excellent post - I appreciate you sharing your observations. I also really appreciate how the moderators are erring on the side of caution when there is room for doubt that a question could be in the spirit of a good answer. I think this site is well on the way to attracting passionate users to curate and time will help.


















Can you point to specific questions that you think should have been closed, that were not? 

So long as nothing off-topic is surviving and harming the signal-to-noise ratio, I don't think it's necessarily required that 3k+ rep users single-handedly close questions.

Longer term, it is important that the "economy" of the site develop and there should be a growing number of 3k+ and 10k+ users for the future, of course -- and that all hinges on voting!

http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/

So, if you want to help empower your fellow users to close, vote up great questions and answers every day!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5None at all - the mods have been awesomely responsive. It was more a question of whether the community has reached the point to not need the mods. I agree and appreciate the vote early and often post. I saw that days after I joined and it convinced me to vote more freely (i figured I was new and should wait a bit before voting) I'll certainly spread the word on voting.


















As an experiment, I went through a couple of dozen popular questions and attempted to edit the titles without changing their meaning too much.

The goal was:


Convert titles to a complete question, not just a fragment of one
Make sure that all titles consisted of 100% grammatical U.S. English
Capture the essence of the question in the title
Never change the original asker's intention
Try not to change the original asker's choice of terminology, so that other people who have the same problem and use the same terminology can still find the question


My hope is that having more grammatical questions on the home page just makes the site look better and thus attracts more people.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Better titles for questions?  Some tips on grammatical editing to make the site look better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice idea, thanks. I'll try to do this as new questions come in.


















Are there any guidelines on preferred person to use when changing titles?

I have on occasion hesitated to add in the part that most OP leave out which is "How do I" or "how do you" or "how does one/do we" to take the usually terse subject phrase and turn it with minimal edititng into a full English sentence.

The best questions already have formed a great opening as they generally are "how exactly does x work" or "what step is needed between x and y"

Have other sites (or this one specifically) come up with a preferred wording for the sake of uniformity? Is uniformity even good - would it be better to have many voices?

Often the OP selects a person the body of the question so it is easy to maintain that voice. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's a great question! As I was editing the questions, I noticed that an awful lot of questions ended up being of the form "How do I..." I think that's fine, even if it's a little bit redundant. The home page just looks better with real, full English sentences.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, for the purpose of helping people find things in a search engine, the full sentence might help. So for example if someone wants to know how to burn a DVD of the OS X Lion install, they are more likely to click on a link entitled "How do I burn a DVD from the OS X Lion Install?" than a link that says "Burn DVD of OS X Lion"...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't *think* we need to enforce a guideline as you whether we should write "How do I..." "How does one..." or "How would you..." Whichever makes sense for the situation is fine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The more I think about this - it feels to me like "How do I" should be the default wording for those terse questions. Friendly, direct, and approachable. Unless the OP has picked another voice or the question is more complicated - it will cater to the large mac user base that isn't in any way technical. The techy questions are easy - editing there usually is needed to shorten things :-)


















Apple has an annoying tendency to release new versions of the MacBooks and just call them "New" without really naming them or giving them version numbers.

For example today's new MacBook Air is supposed to be faster than yesterday's MacBook Air, and there are lots of technical differences, too, so it would be valuable to use tags to distinguish between the various versions.

Does Apple have a standard, canonical way to refer to the various generations of their products that we can use in tags here?

The idea is that when someone visits this site in three years when Apple announces the 14th generation MacBook Air and reads my old question about the "New MacBook Air" they don't think that it's up-to-date...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to refer to various MacBooksb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OWC uses Model IDs, but that's less than convenient.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5what's OWC? .....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5sorry, a popular Mac hardware company http://macsales.com/


















Typically, Apple desktops are differentiated on user forums based on a variety of things, typically processor, year, and/or body type since release cycles vary and a model can undergo multiple changes over the course of a year.

UPDATE: The closest I have ever seen to a canonical list is http://www.everymac.comeverymac.com. Maintaining a list for our needs of that size is going to be a lot of work, even if we just maintain starting with the Intel-based models. For example, for the MacBook Air is shown as:


MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.6 13" (Original)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.8 13" (Original)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.6 13" (NVIDIA)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.86 13" (NVIDIA)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.86 13" (Mid-09)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 2.13 13" (Mid-09)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.4 11" (Late '10)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.6 11" (Late '10)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 1.86 13" (Late '10)
MacBook Air "Core 2 Duo" 2.13 13" (Late '10)


...which could probably be whittled down to...


MacBook Air Original
MacBook Air NVIDIA
MacBook Air Mid-09
MacBook Air Late '10
MacBook Air Mid '11


The trick, I think, is translating what someone has in front of them to a tag they can use in their question. So maybe something like...


macbook-air-original
macbook-air-nvidia
macbook-air-mid-09
macbook-air-late-2010
macbook-air-july-2011


...for all of the various Apple devices.

This time, the latest and greatest is Lion, but this has all happened before, and it will all happen again. There will be zillions of mac users upgrading, and they'll have lots of questions. And since all those questions will be new, Ask Different will have as good a shot at having the best answer than any of those, you know, competitive sites. Essentially, this is a great time to recruit new members!

What can you do to help?


As you install and learn Lion, whenever you have questions, no matter how silly, ask them here. You're not the only one having that question. Millions of other people will, too. Ask them even if you think you're going to be able to find the answer yourself... and if you do find the answer, go ahead and answer it yourself.
When answering Lion questions, do everything you can to overkill it. Don't just answer with a hyperlink to some other discussion group somewhere. Write a detailed, step-by-step, ultra-clear guide with screenshots and examples. Help us have the best possible answer to the common problems and questions people have with Lion.
If a question comes in that is unclear, badly written, badly formatted, or in bad English, edit it into shape. We've always encouraged edits that improve spelling, grammar, and clarity. Make every question into a full sentence.


This is a great opportunity to build up a body of answers to common Lion questions that will be super-popular in the coming weeks as the rest of the Mac universe upgrades. Those questions will bring in lots of traffic from search engines and if Ask Different continues to have great answers like we have in the past, we stand a chance of attracting some great new users who will add value for years to come.

Coming from Super User and answering questions about OS X more than anything else, it seems that quite a few questions now get the "You should ask on apple.stackexchange.com" comment. 

I sincerely hope this does not mean migrating every single OS X (Lion) question here.

I believe Ask Different is large enough to attract their own visitors and keep a steady growth with tons of useful questions and answers. Let's not confuse people by telling them to go elsewhere when their question would be perfectly on-topic on Super User as well.

I hope you can all agree.

(Oh, and happy asking and answering!)

And of course anything iPhone or iPad is specifically and permanently off-topic at [su]


















Since Lion's release we have gotten a lot of new users that are posting answers and sometimes questions without really understanding how the Stack Exchange format works. I am qualifying new users as anyone with a 100 (one hundred) or less reputation, but typically they only have 1 (one) point.

I have been collecting for the past couple of days a script for comments that I post before I manage their answer or question. I don't like closing or deleting questions and answers, but I like to offer an explanation before I do so. I have a standard intro and response (in italics below), and then I tack on the appropriate explanation. Some of these are my own and some I have picked up from other users...


Welcome to the community. Ask Different is not like other forums. Responses to questions must actually attempt to answer it.

Comments like this should propel the general conversation forward

, and not just simply rant. 

If you have a question, you should post your own instead of steering the thread away from the original. Please ask it by clicking the Ask Question button.
If you have sufficient reputation, you may upvote this question. Alternatively, "star" it as a favorite and you will be notified of any new answers. 



I deal with a number of new users over at GD.SE, and I have found this script has made my time moderating more efficient and consistent so I can get back to the real fun of actually answering questions. This really isn't a question as so much as posting a general resource so that others may add to it.

I flagged a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16905/vnc-server-bug-in-os-x-lionquestion for a problem I'm having now (July 22, two days post-Lion), asking it to be reopened, and the flag was marked invalid - does it really make more sense for me to post my own question?

That question has over 500 views, so I hardly think I'm alone. Why can't individual questions be reopened on a case-by-case basis?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You are correct to point out that case-by-case is fair. I have, however, re-opened your question. There was another question I re-opened because the user wasn't able to re-post the question due it possibly being a duplicate the system was catching. That was odd, so I let it fly. But wholesale re-opening is not reasonable because things might have changed from when the question was posted and Lion was officially released and we have no way of knowing if the question is even still valid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is great - vote to reopen the ones that are great on a case by case basis, but don't seek them out or wholesale reopen them all.


















Now that Lion is out, would be great to have a wiki-type thread to track best hidden tips/tricks/tweaks for Lion.  Curious if this is a good topic for AD, or if I should take it to Quora instead ;)

Previously it would have been a Community Wiki, but I see that feature is now gone.  (right?)

It's your reputation, so feel free to dish it out as you want. The waiting period for bounties is designed so that high-rep users can't immediately attach bounties to every question they post, giving them an unfair advantage in getting their questions answered. If you want to reward someone for a great answer it's OK to use the bounty system to do so, though you will still be bound by that waiting period. As long as you don't start promising a bounty bonus with every question you post it's fine.

And yes, you can award the bounty immediately and to an already existing answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With regard to the offer, I think it's fine to occasionally mention that you're going to offer a bounty ahead of time, but just don't make a habit of it and you'll be fine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Excellent - I want to spread out some of the rep, but be sensitive to the expectations on how bounties are seen in the SE ecosystem. This is my first SE site I've spent any serious amount of time in - it's clear that voting and bounty here are much rarer (overall) than say stack overflow where questions with literally hundreds of votes are commonplace (as well as large populations of seasoned users to see behave and emulate)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey, that's me! Glad I could be of assistance :)

Regarding any bounty - seriously don't worry about it. I'm happy to work my way up the rep system slowly.



















You don't appear to have been a member of Stack Exchange until a few weeks ago. How did you come to be part of the CHAOS team?

CHAOS has a strict no-toe-stomping policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You are off to a great start - getting consensus, asking - but taking action nonetheless :-) This joint is starting to look "real classy".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Detail-oriented? Moi? Probably avidly so, and it's the attention to detail (amongst other things) that makes this joint all the classier :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wait, why is this on the meta? Shouldn't this be on the main site?


















This is now a historical curiosity since macOS replaces OS X. And we have a new data point with the iPhone X in writing being verbalized as iPhone 10 when spoken.



Apple's Mac OS X Lion website, documentation, and marketing material all have spaces between OS and X. I'd assume OS X is the correct way to spell OS X. Sidebar, Mac OS X is pronounced Mac Oh Ess Ten, not Oh Ess Ex. This can be confirmed by using the say command in the terminal:

$ say OS X             # Returns Oh Ess Ten
$ say OSX              # Returns Oh Ess Ex
$ say X                # Returns Ex
$ say Roman numeral X  # Returns Ex


Also, as noted by michaelmichael the proper spelling would be Mac OS X.

We just like to be careful - sometimes people get snippy when we bust in and rearrange all the furniture! (To wit: http://meta.english.stackexchange.com/questions/1666/who-is-lauren-and-why-is-she-changing-posts-introducing-myself)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any footage of Jobs saying "Oh Ess Ten"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Almost certainly. If not [tag:steve-jobs], I have certainly heard other Apple people speak the word "ten" (**never** heard Apple say "X").b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq311/ at 13:33 on the timeline, "First: when we deliver Mac OS X Lion …" (pronounced *ten*).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As well as the website, I like to refer to the various versions of the Apple Style Guide, e.g. https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf.  (They revise it every few years, and I haven't checked recently.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great answer, but at some point since Lion, Apple adopted the terminology OS X.  And now (2016) we have macOS Sierra.  In writing specifically about Lion (for exampe) I still like to include the version number and write "OS X 10.7 Lion", at least at the first appearance in the piece.


















To be really nitpicky, it's Mac OS X. They're fanatical about this in Apple Store retail training.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is that something I should be striving for when I'm editing? Or is it "colloquially" ok to just leave it at OS X?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You know what? I stand corrected. Even though http://www.apple.com/osx 404s, all the branding on http://www.apple.com/macosx talks about OS X Lion - no "Mac". Perhaps they've changed their stance since I heard the above anecdote. I'm sure it won't matter much unless Mac OS is still in version 10 by the time iOS reaches its 10th version.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, they changed their stance with Lion for some reason and are using "OS X" on the website and marketing material. Though for some reason they still use "Mac OS X" in the actual software. Bizzare...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's always been Mac OS X for a long time, but the people that "read the tea leaves" and watch each slide of every keynote that apple publishes have noticed Apple to start to write OS X when it used to _always_ have Mac before the OS. Long time observers feel some references to OS X may stand alone when referring to commonality between iOS and Mac OS X. Best to use Mac until the stand alone usage gains traction or it's clearly meant to be inclusive of iOS and Mac OS X.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks michaelmichael, I updated my post.


















Here's how I would do it:

"I have a MacBook Pro."
"I have four MacBook Pros."
"I have an iPod Touch."
"I have eight iPod Touches."

..etc. I would use the natural plural if there are more than one. It looks weird, but "I have four MacBooks Pro," looks even weirder to me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So "MacBook*s* Pro", which is technically grammatically correct (like Attorneys General), is just sort of out of the picture?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abby I'd say so. But, I've got no source for any of this so I may be totally wrong.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll take your word for it. I'm just wondering about the preference of Apple.SE's top users - not really worried about what the official company line is. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We'll vote you off the island if "MacBooks Pro" enters use; for that is something up with which we will not put. Grammatical excellence has a limit :-).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To me "macbook pros" looks and sounds weirder.


















A tag, by definition, is for questions about its stated topic. Repeating "questions about" or variants thereof ("concerning", etc) is redundant and looks bad.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag wikis should not contain "Questions about" or "Concerning"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oops - I'm guilty of at least one of those. Thanks for pointing it out - it was an easy mistake for a new tag editor to make. I bet I'll remember it next time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I created a bunch of tags where I used the term "Concerning" specifically because I saw so many existing tags that used "Questions about" and I thought "Concerning" was more concise and helpful. Now I've learned that the powers that be frown on both terms. Now I know better.


















This week, Ask Different is sponsoring the Daring Fireball RSS feed. This means Gruber will run a little ad for Ask Different in the http://daringfireball.net/index.xmlRSS feed. I believe there will also be a plug live on the http://daringfireball.net/Daring Fireball homepage on Friday, but don't quote me on that. 

John Gruber is just one guy who likes to talk and write about Mac stuff on the internet. There are loads more out there. Stack Exchange has a budget to do this kind of sponsorship and promotion for the satellite sites, but we need you guys to tell us where it'd be best spent. 

So! Help me help you help people on the internet figure out how to do cool stuff with Apple products, folks! Let me know what your ideas are.

Edit: I just want to clarify - we are not doing a Big Marketing And Sponsoring Stuff Push at this time. Ideas you guys post here will go in our back pocket and be trotted out one at a time now and then, when budgets and other resources allow. That said, I'm not just pretending to ask for suggestions so I can ignore them! Promise. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What sort of promotions and/or sponsorships and/or other stuff would you guys like to see?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"John Gruber is just one guy who likes to talk and write about Mac stuff on the internet." If that isn't scholarly understatement, I don't know what is...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, I found out about and started participating in your site because you sponsored the Daring Fireball RSS feed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is, of course, another question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also found out about Ask Different and joined up because of reading about it on Daring Fireball.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wheat and Daniel - thanks for the notes! I'm glad you both found us.


















I would absolutely reach out to Dan Benjamin to see what his rates are for sponsoring some part of his podcasts. I am partial to build and analyze (or back to work) but I'm sure he and his staff could guide you to two or three shows that might be a good fit and be looking for episodes.  I'm ignorant of the costs involved, but perhaps hitting a few shows / weeks apart would be a nice spread out effort to raise awareness.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree 100%. And Stack Exchange has already reached out to him - Careers 2.0 has sponsored a few shows already. And with regard to the show that would be the best fit, I'd have to go with Hypercritical. It's for Mac alpha-geeks and got over 1M downloads for ep#27. B&A is great, but it's more for devs, and B2W is more about productivity than technology.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I looked into this and found out Ask Different actually did sponsor Hypercritical #27. (Did you guys know this and I just missed this? I'm neeeew.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abby It looks like it was sponsored by Careers 2.0, not Ask Different: http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/27b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle aha! I'll keep it in Ask Different's back pocket then.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle - awesome news - I mentioned B2W since I was thinking this site needs exposure to more consumers. Kind of like the people that walk into the average apple store. Moms and grandmothers. I'll have to ask my dad what he listens to - he hasn't taken my hints yet about self support. :-) Also, creative types like mike_ftw (twitter) and let's make mistakes might be worth targeting. (he reads sponsor names for $5 but will likely insult us so wear asbestos pants that day)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One benefit for B2W would be that Merlin typically goes off for a while about the sponsor, so it's more effective than Dan just reading the copy for 30 seconds. But I still think there's a lot of Apple nerds out there that either don't know about us or don't participate, and I'd like to see that change


















Game Center would be on-topic here since it is Apple software.

However, if you're asking about programming or developing for/with Game Center, that would be off-topic since this site is not about development. That kind of a question should go on Stack Overflow.

If you've got a question about Game Center that doesn't involve development/programming, go ahead and ask it here. I can easily make you a [game-center] tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Plus, there's also http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question is not to do with development, but this is quite in-depth for Game Center - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19774/possible-to-force-a-sync-of-game-center-achievements-already-gained, it might be solved by individual apps, so cross-posting might be valid?

Is the pale blue too pale?

I think so, but alternative answers will be appreciated. 

Thank you

Background

I'm usually a careful reader, but at least twice I have missed things of importance, because of the paleness of the pale blue text that is currently used at Ask Different. 

Lack of contrast can cause some words, or words in some contexts, to be too easily overlooked. Loosely we might describe this as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_blindnessword blindness but the contrast/faintness issue could affect anyone, not just dyslexics. 

Considerations

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/268/8546Design for the Apple StackExchange site in particular, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/268/design-for-the-apple-stackexchange-site/269#269comments under an answer from Kyle Cronin.

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/558/8546What's up with the red on green bubbles?


  … yellow/purple or orange/blue is better for people that are colorblind if you really want to use contrasting / opposing colors … 


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/295/8546New design issues



There may be comparable questions/answers in other meta areas, and I don't know whether the pale blue that's currently used is based on a template from a different stack, but I thought I should focus first on the Ask Different area. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the pale blue of texts — on white, pale blue and beige backgrounds — too pale at Ask Different?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some raising of voices under http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/97448/alert-users-as-to-why-their-lert-is-being-removed-from-comments/97495#97495 that might have been avoided if the pale blue three-letter word had been more noticeable on a white background alongside a dark avatar ([example](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19544/using-modifierleft-right-to-move-between-words-in-an-editing-window/19571#19571)) …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Probably not detectable in my writing, but a learning support tutor once told me that I'm dyslexic …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you tell us where you missed the pale-colored text? I've been generally okay with it; I'm curious where it was a problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nathan hi, at http://www.wuala.com/%23%23Apple-support/members/grahamperrin/2011/08/03/a/?mode=gallery folders a and b, each containing three versions of one screenshot. The second of each triplet shows where I get the word blindness. In (a) I was blind to an entire line that I had written — a real "hmm" moment. Example (b) might be more understandable — very short username pale on pale, surrounded by things that are larger and darker. A little blur (not just for dramatic effect) and hopefully you'll see what I mean.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The red/green was a clear temporary error. The designers didn't intend / realize how far that change would go and reverted it until other changes could roll out at the same time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Again today I looked at a page a few times but could not see what I wanted. This time it was pale blue on beige that wasn't 'sinking in'. Maybe it's just me but it's really unusual for me to be missing things so often … http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1543321#1543321


















I would love to see a much stronger blue to have more contrast for all the blue text.

Even if the designers felt it was the wrong choice, i'd love to see a week or two to try it out - let everyone know we're trying it (or don't). Then revert it for two weeks to "study the results".

You will have hard data on how many complaints were lodged due to the initial change - and due to the reversion back (from those that liked the new).

I would propose something like the new 



Especially the darker shades when examined in a loupe on LCD panels.


I should also inquire as the beer preference of the designers and the address to which it should be sent for critiquing their work since it is never easy to re-design something since the colors we have now is the color they came up with, and not by accident.

Stack Exchange wants to pay for Lion upgrades for Ask Different's top users. If you've got more than 1000 reputation on Ask Different and you still need to upgrade to Lion, https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/7749/abby-t-millersend me an email! 

You've got until 5PM New York time on Monday, August 8th to send me an email requesting your upgrade. Please use the words "ask", "different", "lion", and "upgrade" in your subject line so it'll go to a filter I'm watching closely. And, if you would, please stick a link to your Ask Different user profile in the body of the email so I can snoop around. 

If you still need to upgrade, but you've only got 900 rep... you've got until Monday to ask, answer, and edit your way up to 1000!

Update:
Seriously, you guys! We really want to buy you your copy of Lion. We've gotten a few requests so far, but we want more. So I'm extending the deadline to this coming Friday the 12th at 5PM New York time. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(Deadline Extended!) Do you have >1k rep on Ask Different? Do you still need a copy of Lion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abby The email in your "about me" section and the email in the email section of your profile are different. Is that intentional? Or do they both go to the same place?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle They both go to the same place. And I thought the "email" email wasn't visible? Or can you just see it 'cause you're a mod? This house so confusing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abby The latter - mods can see everything except openid in the profileb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great Ideas! (I've already got Lion, can I get reimbursed? :P)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Almost wish I'd waited! Still, great idea!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Gah I didn't see this "question" in time :-(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nippysaurus: yes, you did! Check the update :) (unless you mean you bought it already)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah I bought it already :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've also already bought it but I appreciate the thought. :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You people are so awesome!

http://twitter.com/stackappleStackApple on Twitter

I doubt that the short name can be changed. 

My first thought was that the name to the side could be updated: 


from Apple Stack Exchange
to Ask Different


Later I became http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1537771#1537771aware of @askdifferent on Twitter, which now has its own question https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/654/8546Who owns @askdifferent on twitter?

So: whatever happens to the side name etc. of @StackApple should be not decided until after the @askdifferent question is answered. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are going to change the bio line of @StackApple to something like "Stack Exchange Q&A for power users of Apple hardware and software", which means we will be able to change the Real Name to Ask Different without having to mention SE. In theory. (This is not a fix by any means, but it's a good first step.)


















[I heard you guys all saying, "gee, I wish there were more meta posts from CHAOS for me to weigh in on," so I thought I'd oblige!]

We are toying with the idea of putting ads for Ask Different on Stack Overflow. Specifically, they'd go on the [osx] and [ios] tag pages, or perhaps on questions with those tags. We'll get https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/147574/jinour awesome designer to put the actual ad together (though he doesn't know it yet...), but before we get to that point, we need some ideas. 

The ad can be anything you want. It can be in the same style as the other ads running around the network that contain sample questions...



...or it can be an image with a logo...



...or it can be anything else you guys want.

So! What are your ideas? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should the Ask Different ads look like?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would LOVE a flash ad with a Steve Jobs surrounded by flashing lights saying "You won a free iPad". Oh, and lots of sound!


















I would certainly have one or two appeal to people with strong opinions/ windows or linux background. Engaging / inviting them in would be good for the site.



Other random ideas in the hat are...

Maybe something like curious about the "mac side of the moon". (with a moon crescent silouette photo / just the words and the Ask Different icon in the corner)

Or a 2001 style rectangular object and a tag line - "My god, it's full of Apple answers"

It would have to be subtle and in good taste (and respectful of trademarks), but something that edged up to "what color is that kool-aid you have in your glass?" might be fun to work on.

Just some crazy half-baked ideas...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you suggesting the 'mac side of the moon' as a way to engage windows/linux folks like you suggested in your first line? Or is that a separate thought?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They all are independent - the idea of attracting win/Linux is an idea to kick around - then I made three theme suggestions that don't really play on Linux or windows from where I sit...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5roger, was just wondering - "dark side of the moon" could sorta seem like a "come over to the dark side..." idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5also: "that's no moon!"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ha ha - indeed. The good designer might make it hard to tell which side of the moon was which - or even have it change yin/yang from top to bottom to make a point that perhaps your side isn't so fixed :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the 2001 idea. But it's sure to generate complaints that iPhone didn't even exist back then ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would love to see some mockups of these if you feel like it.

I suggest editing the highest voted answer to indicate it's specific to iOS versions 4.x, and then providing another answer that indicates "this works in iOS 5.x and better.."

There is a http://twitter.com/#!/askdifferenttwitter account with our name that has no tweets or followers and isn't following anyone. My fervent hope is that someone in the Ask Different community is squatting on it in case a use for it arises. 

Ask Different's http://twitter.com/#!/stackapplecurrent twitter account is bundled with the accounts for all of the rest of the SE sites. Configuring and implementing a new function for the Stack exchange twitter accounts is going to take a lot of time and discussion, but a good first step is at least to make the name of the twitter account consistent with Ask Different's branding.

If the owner of the account is not in our community, we will go through twitter's proper channels to claim the account. But that's the hard way. I'm hoping it'll be easy. 

So: do you own @askdifferent or know who does?

Oops, I figured this out. I just edited the question and the question went back up to the top.

In the case that you wish to see your question answered more quickly you could offer a bounty on it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK..thank you for letting me know. I know that the question I asked could be answered, but it wasn't, so I wanted it to be "bumped" back up. And the editing I did was helpful editing, not just editing for the sake of editing.


















When you select "off topic" as a reason to close a post on most of the other established Stack Exchange sites, you're presented with a menu similar to this:



As you can see, there are a few pre-selected sites that you can vote for a question to be migrated to instead of simply closing the question.

However, even though Ask Different has been a public site for a while, we still don't have any primary migration paths, other than our own meta site:



This means that any time a question needs to be migrated off our site it needs to be flagged for moderator attention, as moderators can migrate to any site in the network. To get a sense of where some of our questions have gone, here are the stats for questions migrated away from our site in the past 90 days:



Nothing too unsurprising here - we occasionally get questions about programming we migrate to Stack Overflow and Programmers, and the occasional computer-related question that doesn't involve Apple that we migrate to Super User.

So I think it makes sense for these three sites Stack Overflow and Super User to be in our migration paths. Does anyone have any objection to the sites I've listed? We have one more spot, is there another site that should also be included?

edit: Taking a closer look at those questions that we migrated to Programmers, one post has been deleted for moderation reasons, one has been removed by its author, and the other has a score of -3. So, no Programmers route then.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hackintoshhackintosh => https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osx86osx86 or a synonym

Forgetting that I recently gained reputation to create tags, I added tags to https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/8392/8546What's the advantage of buying an iMac over building a Hackintosh? (expected the system to respond that there's no such tag; only after the edition was submitted did I remember that I had the privilege to create). Sorry — it wasn't intended to jump the gun without discussion. After making this post I http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1550431#1550431waved a flag in Ask Different Chat.  

Consideration

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2/8546Can one ask Hackintosh questions on Ask Different?

Actions

Either: 


remove both tags (and I'll remember to not re-use either one until after the meta question above is answered); or
allow one tag, make the other a synonym.


From my point of view, absolutely no rush. 

Reference

For what it's worth, in Wikipedia there's a proposal to merge http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintoshhackintosh into http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86OSx86. 

Of the two pages, the page for OSx86 is vastly more fleshy, and (like https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2/8546Can one ask Hackintosh questions on Ask Different?) includes coverage of legal issues and Apple objections. In Ask Different tag info for OSx86, we could simply refer to the Wikipedia page, and so help to avoid excessive chat in Stack Exchange. So of the two tags, my preference would be osx86.

Meta Ask Different, for pretty obvious reasons.

Stack Overflow due to scope, no ObjC programming question on this site.

I have not, and I do hope they let us know when they send it out because the building I live in often does not tell me when a package has arrived for me - I more or less have to know about it and keep checking with the desk.

I believe nothing's been sent yet. I'll check in with the sender tomorrow morning and report back.

Reporting back!

It does look like that answer definitely fixed the problem for the OP, since he commented on the answer first, then accepted the answer later (mouse over the timestamps to see the sequence of events in UTC time).

I agree the presence of the accepted answer is problematic; if the accepted answer wasn't there, I'd say ...


  bump that question up with votes and a comment [ed: actually an edit is necessary]


... but since it is, I think you have no choice but to ...


  open another question that notes that I have tried all the ideas from the other one with no success


... and link to the older question, obviously.

There's actually a third path here but it is much harder:


  figure out the solution to your problem on your own, and post it as another answer on the question


It's probably OK to have two linked questions here, so long as the text of the question is different enough to attract people who search using different terms for the same problem, etc.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Roger. I'll put in due diligence on option 3 and then go for option 2. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Especially for something like this, where the same solution might not work for everyone, then I don't see the problem with a new question. Especially if you state that you've already tried all the previously mentioned tips, as that helps narrow the focus a bit.


















I don't have any problem with legibility, but as a new user I'm stumped when it comes to the significance of the blue and beige backgrounds. I expected the FAQ to provide an explanation, but this wasn't the case. Can anyone enlighten me?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Compared with for example http://i.stack.imgur.com/hUCvY.png (taken from http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/268/8546) I guess that the **beige** of each question and answer, with grey between each one, helps to distinguish each post. I see blue backgrounds used in various ways, most recently in [a popular question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/17759/8546). Also, Ask Different *meta* is more brown and beige than Ask Different. If that doesn't answer your question, maybe it needs to be asked as a question ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for that. I'll take you up on that concluding gentle hint and ask a question (though now it seems that beige backgrounds have been retired?).


















I was looking for a private room on Ask Different chat - and saw the link I usually follow at the top gone.

It's still in the link roll at the bottom, but I kind of liked it at the top.

Is this a temporary removal or something more permanent?


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is chat gone from the title bar permanently?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In addition, why do we have a link to the SE blog? Surely that's more appropriate for the bottom (not site-specific) than this site's chat room.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101464/eeeek-where-did-the-chat-top-navigation-link-gob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd put the SE info on the far left where the combined "hot questions" live - not amongst the Ask Different specific search, faq, meta/main [chat] and review links live


















This also is listed as Apple and not Ask Different in the chat parent user dialog.


go to http://chat.stackexchange.com/http://chat.stackexchange.com/ and log in if needed
select your user name at the top of the screen (to the left of users | rooms | faq)
select change next to parent user 
Apple matches the Ask Different site - ask only matches Ask Ubuntu


Now that this name change is complete - the search tab for selecting a site is quite intelligent, matching the obvious Ask but also matching the intuitive, but not shown Apple string as you type it. This is very cool!

Kyle pointed that this might be a temporary thing. 

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101464/eeeek-where-did-the-chat-top-navigation-link-goEeeek! Where did the chat top navigation link go?

It appears when the Stack Exchange blog is updated - it pre-empts the normal chat link for Ask Different. I would expect (and appreciate) to see the "new blog" bubble and link to the immediate right of the StackExchange pull down rather than embedded between the Ask Different specific review, chat, meta and faq links.



Stack Exchange general information on the far left.
Ask Different specific links on the right.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5this has since been changed; only sites with a per-site blog will get the top notification, e.g. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/blog-overflow/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks Jeff! I liked seeing it and would have never seen the blog otherwise - perhaps it can come back to the right of "Stack Exchange" on the far, far left. Add in the blog, but leaving the right past my name or the "login" link for Ask Different only links.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5metas are still hooked up to the SE/SO blog so just visit your meta to see the [new] blog indicator in that case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 I like the idea of the StackExchange blog notice on the left where the StackExchange drop down is.


















I have an image that makes https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20462/why-do-i-see-two-sizes-for-storage-space-availableWhy do I see two sizes for storage space available? immediately clear, but I cannot embed it inline. I'm given the error message "We're sorry, but as a spam prevention mechanism, new users aren't allowed to post images.

We've gotten some enthusiastic responses about the idea of a https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/643/are-you-interested-in-beta-testing-os-x-and-ios-appsdeveloper/beta tester matchup program between Ask Different and Stack Overflow. My thanks to everyone who has volunteered so far. 

The next step in making this happen is getting some apps for people to test. Since there isn't a meta for just OS X/iOS developers on Stack Overflow, we think one of the most effective ways to attract developers' attention to the program is to stick an ad on the relevant tag pages over there.

I am not a designer. I have zero Photoshop Fu. I can ask Stack Exchange's https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/147574/jindesigner-in-residence to put something together for us. But, the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/455/community-promotion-ads-1h-2011community promotion ads for this site came out so well that I thought I'd open the design up to the community's imagination.

I'm not even going to stoop to posting https://i.imgur.com/Ggt9S.jpgwhat I hacked together as an example. Just post your 220x250px image as an answer and the votes will decide!

(Posts are not subject to the parameters of the community promotion ads, since these images will be downloaded and run on Stack Overflow "by hand", not by the run-community-ads bot.)

Update:
I lied. I'm going to inflict my mockup on you. 



Clearly, these decisions should not be in my hands. You should probably help.

"new" is gone on the main AD site (but not on this meta AD site, oddly), but "blog" still remains instead of chat, so it looks like this is a permanent change, unfortunately. I hope they change it back - I used the chat link at the top a lot.

This question is a reaction to a hint in a comment on an answer of mine https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/638/is-the-pale-blue-of-texts-on-white-pale-blue-and-beige-backgrounds-too-pale/671#671on this thread.

I'm a new user, and have been surprised not to find any explanation (in the FAQ, for example) of the significance of the blue background which some questions display with. The comment referred to suggests that popularity is a possible consideration, but I would appreciate a definitive explanation.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the significance of the blue background on some questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While at it, and not wishing to submit a further question, may I say that it was only through observation that I realised the significance of the green box against which some answer indications appear (my interpretation being that these are answers which have been accepted by the question poser).


















The blue background is placed in those questions that are tagged with tags you have selected as favorites. One of my tag favorites is xcode and any question that was tagged with xcode appears with the blue background. It is a way to help you find those questions that are more relevant to your specific interests.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So you're saying it's viewer dependent? That others don't see blue where I do? I ask because I'm only a newbie here, and have yet to select tag favourites. Taking a closer look, it seems more as if the blue is added to questions which feature tags which I've used in my questions. You have certainly steered me in the right direction. Thanks for that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is viewer-dependent. It wouldn't surprise me if they had a mechanism to highlight questions if someone hasn't selected any favorites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome! Thanks for sharing that.

Have you considered getting that cough looked at? You are in serious need to calibrate your screen - that is way lighter than any of my 5 screens - viewing the web site and then your snippet - your OS is rendering text far too faintly.

The shot is of meta, by the way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I think he posted a screenshot, in which case it's not affected by monitor calibration.

In tagging https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21447/what-is-the-difference-between-the-variant-language-dictionaries-in-os-xthis question, I was surprised that the language tag was described as being for programming language rather than human language. However, of all the questions using the language tag, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14663/two-macbook-pros-display-my-webpage-differentlyonly one is related to programming language. The rest all are related to human language.

Any objections to changing the meaning of the language tag to be human language?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Change the language tag to mean human language?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That sounds pretty sensible. Tags should be defined as how they are used, not how they could be used, and clearly it is being used all for spoken language.


















Yes, as you have done, I would simply remove the one oddball usage and standardize on what it seems to be used for in practice.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is the beauty of tags - the site shapes what they mean here. Yes - the tag summary helps to define things for new people, but more importantly it shows what that tag means in the narrow focus of questions being asked here. The cooking site can have one meaning for brown and the web design site a very different and conflicting meaning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5tag wikis are also very important for this, particularly in light of http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/improved-tagging/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't have even noticed if not for the new tag completion -- I think it's great.


















This is indeed very generous. I sadly am not going to quite get to 1000 (only been a member for three weeks!) but it is great that you are rewarding people's involvement on the site this way.

ok, the title is a little bit aggressive.

I'm relatively new here, but the examples of 'community wiki' that I've seen so far seem to be actively detrimental to the web site.  For example, the 'What Lion bugs irritate you the most?' thread takes lots of good questions and answers that could (should?) be individually placed on the main page and effectively hides them in a single thread.  Sure, it's possible that everyone who posts in that thread also posts their question separately, but I don't think that really happens.

I'm here because this site isn't your typical forum with it's endless rants and raves but rather concentrates on the meat of questions and answers.  I'm saddened to see anything that takes away from that wonderful design.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to kill off 'community wiki' entriesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ones like http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6331/shortcuts-gestures-you-cant-live-without or ***X you can't live without*** seem to degenerate the most rapidly to me. I don't know if I should comment since someone I really respect characterized as "air-headed" the only question i've asked that went "community"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike: the analogy I touched on in my comment on Kyle's answer was an old one used for "fun" questions on SO: they're like salt, in that a little bit brings out the flavor of the site and makes it more palatable to the casual reader, but too much ruins it. SO had to start cracking down on these after reading the list of top questions became like eating a big bowl of salt: all "favorite cartoon" and "hidden feature" questions. The lesson isn't "kill them with fire" - it's "keep them under control". No one wants to sift through pages of fluff looking for a solution to a problem they're facing.



















  I'm relatively new here


Maybe so, but you figured it out a lot faster than most. These "let's throw everything into one big pot and see what floats to the top!" questions do actively subvert the very goals these sites were built to achieve!

So what can you do? In order:


Leave a comment noting that these would be easier to find as separate Q&A
Down-vote
Flag for moderator attention 
(once you have the necessary reputation) Vote to close.
(once the question is closed and you have a bit more rep) Vote to delete.


FWIW, the primary purpose of Community Wiki is to encourage collaborative editing by removing the "first author gets all the points" aspect (and allowing lower-rep users to contribute). There's absolutely nothing wrong with that... However, if you see a question with many answers where all are CW, that's a warning: either a moderator, or the system itself is telling us that this Q&A could use a lot less answering and a lot more editing!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a current  "here's how the site hopes Community Wiki should work" document? I suppose part is based on how it used to work, but it might be nice to have the current thinking - then a dose of how we got here, taking the past into consideration.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike sure see http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/


















Back when Stack Overflow was first started, the Community Wiki feature that was initially created to add a wiki-like aspect to some questions was co-opted for use with poll-like questions, and questions where it didn't make sense for the author to receive reputation from them.

I've always liked these questions and felt them to be an important part of building and maintaining a healthy community here, but I do agree that, if left unchecked, the site would quickly fill up with people abusing them. However, I think that we've maintained a pretty good balance here on Ask Different - we don't allow too many to be created, and the ones that are usually are informative and maintained. There are some that do fall through the cracks, sure, but I think that by and large they're more beneficial than detrimental.

One example of a benefit is with the recent https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17759/what-tiny-thing-in-lion-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guardWhat tiny thing in Lion makes you smile or caught you off guard? question, it was linked to on Reddit, Hacker News, and Twitter, and several other sites and brought a considerable amount of traffic to our site. This is very hard to do with a 'typical' question because they're usually of limited scope and of interest to a relatively small group of people. In order to get the network effect with a question, it needs to be one with a much broader appeal, and these tend to skew towards those that are of the Community Wiki style.

Finally, I think that the popularity of these questions may make it appear that there are more of them than there are, so here are some numbers:


Total number of questions: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions6,778
Number of Community Wiki questions: https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=is%3Aquestion+wiki%3A173 (1%)
Number of Community Wiki questions with at least 1K views: https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=is%3Aquestion+wiki%3A1+views%3A1000&submit=search12 (0.2%)
Number of Community Wiki questions with at least 10 votes: https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=is%3Aquestion+wiki%3A1+votes%3A10&submit=search17 (0.25%)
Number of Community Wiki questions with at least 10 answers: 23 (0.3%)


So yes, I will concede that the questions, in general, don't really fit in with the rest of the site. But for the ones we do have we try to keep the quality high and the quantity low, and I think that eliminating them altogether would be a mistake.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5we have a blog post coming on this from Grace Note, but you have hit upon the right theme here -- there should be *some* of these questions but not very many. They should be *rare*. We are thinking 1 in 50 questions as an absolute MAXIMUM, and more realistically 1 in 100 as you are seeing with your data.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Kyle, you seem to be taking the "little bit of fun on the site is like a little bit of salt on your food" perspective... Which is great, *but*... Alrescha's example wasn't the air-headed "what makes you smile" post - it was the potentially *useful* "what bugs irritate you" post. Instead of ~30 questions regarding fixes / work-arounds for irritating bugs, you have one question with 30 bugs, with explanations / fixes / work-arounds pushed into *comments!*


















In this case, it was a matter of crossed signals. I loaded the page before you posted your comment, you posted the comment, and then I migrated it (8 seconds later) without knowing about the duplicate. And unfortunately, there's no way to un-migrate from this end - it has to be dealt with on Stack Overflow.

If I see that there's a cross-post on another site I won't migrate. The issue here was that I didn't see it and it clearly was a programming question, so I just moved it over.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or, simply don't cross-post and let the community and mods sort it out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did you flag the SO question?  Popping into the Teacher's Lounge is also a quick way to get stuff like this handled.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hah, eight seconds!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Bavarious Actually I did the math wrong, it was 12 seconds.


















I'm a big proponent of this being added - especially after trying to use the site exclusively for a few days on the iPad.

Arguments against:


Another icon in the edit bar adds clutter or bumps something still widely used.
Those that don't like seeing ⌘ might oppose tools that encourage use of the <kbd> tag.
The formatting of these disrupt paragraphs just like an image embed can.


Arguments for:


The iPad keyboard is way less efficient to get to < and / than a physical keyboard.


Keying S takes 12 presses on a real keyboard (i suppose 5 of those are shift "letters" but it is one action to make the letter not two taps like on the iPad)
Keying S takes 25 presses on an iOS keyboard (try it yourself right now... I bet you'll mess up the / and have to use a few more taps than the most efficient way about half the time you try this)

It makes discovery of and use of that tag easier for new users.
It makes the site look professional and matches http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/APStyleGuide/APSG_2009.pdfApple's style of documenting key presses. (See the following pages of the 2009 version of the style document: 41, 100-101 especially read pages 100 through 101 for the difference between order, using - vs +, and more) 
It makes it easier non-native level english readers to understand in a flash that the answer calls for a specific key to be pressed.
AutoCorrect on iOS and now Mac OS X futzes with these non-dictionary tags making automation more important to avoid incorrect tags.




Here's where my opinion really gets aired - I realize and like that it's not a universally shared opinion :-)

I would like to be lazy and have the toolbar help me add key caps markup syntax easier to type.

< kbd > and < /kbd > could be added just like block quote and code sample. 

Are there any stats on how often these tags get used on Ask Different? What percentage/count of users has ever used X tag might be interesting to compare. Also - what percentage/count of questions have used said tags.

Perhaps no-one is using < kbd > except for me?

I think the style guide is a bit harsh on how bad these are in practice - so I'll add an answer there in defense of how easily people new to mac can see option + command +P +R intuitively means you hold them all down together.

Specifically, the confusion over naming of keys is due to Apple changing their symbols over time, people remembering the old way, and the fact that keyboards are different around the world as well as on Windows / Mac. 

The other confusion is the difference between the silkscreened mask on the keyboard doesn't match the menu shortcuts. For example, all macs now use ▲ and ▼ printed on the keyboard, but if you look in the Bookmarks menu of safari, you will see the characters drawn as ↑ and ↓



Blaming the key cap <kbd> format for these problems is a red herring - the confusion exists whether you spell out command or use ⌘, whether it's an up arrow or an up triangle. We as a community have to deal with that confusion either way. Why not automate the formatting so people can pay attention to the message - making answers here match what mac users have had in their language for describing key presses for years.

I am of a strong opinion that when used properly, these tags make the site look professional and better match the documentation that Apple provides. I would want to encourage people to know it's possible and make it easier to select a word like option and automate wrapping it.

Geting to the < > and / are tedious alone on iOS and autocorrect needs to be beat into submission which makes it even harder to get that edit done while mobile.

I concur that we should generally follow its suggestions, but I still advocate respecting individual authors choices and not editing purely for style unless the message is unclear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed - the style guide is sorely outdated for iOS and recent changes, but it's a good first step and worth considering when we try to figure out what works best here. I'm happier going against it when we all consider and select a better way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It wasn't my intent to align myself with the Style Guide's dislike for  icons—of which I am also a fan and frequent user.

It's worth discussing that item whether or not we get better tools for making . I'd like to focus on that for this thread.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I’d argue that looking at how much `` is already used on Ask Different would be a bit of a red herring, since some (a majority?) of users don’t know that it exists, so can’t use it. For example, I only learnt about it when I saw it used in a post, and decided to peek under the covers and see how it was done.

Suggesting tag synonyms requires 2500 reputation which seems REALLY steep for something so basic. It's strange because there is a badge for 3 such suggestions yet it's only considered a bronze badge.

2500 may seem high now, but 2 or 3 years from now, I assure you -- it won't.

The limit is there to ensure that truly experienced users are coordinating on the tags, which are the primary organizational system on the site.

It's OK if only a few users and the moderators are making these decisions now; as the site grows, more people will gain the privilege and can contribute to the process.

Hm, my initial reaction was to rename email to mail, as the latter seems to be the word Apple prefers to use. However, as "mail" can also be used to mean "Mail.app" or "iOS Mail" I agree that it makes sense to force people to disambiguate, otherwise the tag itself is worthless. Whether that can be accomplished by making the tag wiki clear that "mail" is about "email" or whether we should set up the synonym mail -> email or even if we should just ban "mail" altogether, I don't know.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I struggle a bit with a tag name for the mobile mail client - iOS-mail is kludgy, mobile-mail is the closest to how the program itself is named. As to mail or email - I don't' care - but feel one should be a synonym of the other. It was 10 to 1 in favor of email when I started editing this evening.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I lean towards "ios-mail" because [Apple itself has used the term](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ios+mail%22+site:apple.com+-inurl:discussions+-inurl:itunes).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Internally, the locations of the binaries are `/Applications/Mail.app`
 and `/Applications/MobileMail.app` and most developers use this to differentiate between the mobile builds of safari and mail. Instead we get to read the tea leaves in public documentation :-) Since there are only 6 hits for iOS Mail - it's clear that apple prefers to call it Mail and hope/expect/demand that context make the iOS / Mac line clear. Unfortunately, this goes against the way tags are thought of here needing to be able to stand alone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about `Mail.ipa` for the iOS mail client ?


















In thinking of making an advert, I find I'm not at all clear how this will work within the guidelines to avoid self promotion on SE. We have a great site here with low promotion and I don't think any of the devs will in any way be crossing this line - but thinking this out will ensure clarity in ensuring unwelcome sorts of promotion are still clear to all. 

Has this been spelled out yet (or are there any guidelines if this is being done as an experiment knowing it goes into the gray area and how much latitude will be allowed to test this idea out)?

Where will the interaction between Apple.SE users and StackOverflow users happen? 

There will be numerous questions from the Apple.SE users on:


configuration profiles
side loading apps in iTunes / Xcode / Server Profile Manager / iPhone Utility
console error messages
beta builds (developers tend to want to get testers for the new products)


Will they use a tag and participate on SO ? 
Will they participate here (or a new Area 51 site)?

Will they be asked to take their discussions elsewhere - just letting this be an introduction service.

I believe that there is a reason behind the current behavior. The reason, put simply, is to discourage abuse of the system.

Imagine this scenario:  


Someone offers a bounty on a question. They lose no rep yet.
The bounty encourages people to answer.
Someone correctly answers the question.
The asker, wanting to save some rep, decides to pretend that the answer didn't work and not award the bounty.


So, this could allow the asker to get an answer because of the bounty, but not 'pay' the promised amount.

Now, with the current system, the asker loses their rep right away and it's put to the side until it is awarded. There's no way that the asker can regain or avoid losing their rep.
Now, when someone correctly answers the question, the asker has no reason not to award the bounty.

Note that there is already a system in place to help stop abuse of the bounty system: If the bounty is not awarded, the highest-voted new answer with 2 or more upvotes is automatically awarded half the bounty.
However, I don't think that this system would be sufficient on its own.

I just put up my first 50 Bounty, and I was under the impression that I get it back if no-one answered suitably.  I can't see how if the points are deducted now or later that would have any effect on me not accepting a valid answer.  Am I right in reading that once offered, those points are lost even if no-one answers?  Apologies if this seems a dumb question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe this is covered in http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#bountyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK.  I'm happy with it, but I'm not sure it's how I would do it, if the best answer get's half even if it's not accepted, I think it would be fair to also provide half back to the OP if there are no answers that meet that criteria, which is what I expect to get for mine :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sometimes the most-voted answer isn't the correct or best one, just the first one. The behavior, while not ideal, is the most appropriate one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Think of it this way - any answer that is eligible for the half-off bounty loophole was proffered in light of the chance of getting said bounty. If the bounty offerer is either too picky, not appreciative or simply can't log in again, the community gets to dole out half the points offered. It entices the bounty offerer to stay connected and comment / edit and rewards the people answering in the event the offerer can't or won't deliver the goods.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with handing it out automatically on the basis that there were suitable answers with upvotes.  It's the points disappearing when no-one answers that I feel isn't quite right.  I'm happy to lose such point where a contribution has been made to earn them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Going to accept this answer, and leave a final note that as it stands as per my last comment, I don't think that the system is quite right, or rather it does not fit with my definition of the word "Bounty", maybe offering, or donation :)


















I suspect some CSS rule is being incorrectly applied to the "new" feature notifier.

I'm talking about the "new" block that appears when a new navigation or other site element is added. It showed up most recently on the main site when the blog link was added.



The e is nearly solid, and the rest of the text just looks... off. Any ideas why?

Additionally, as provided by @stuffe, As well as being blocky, it's not aligned to the text baseline.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is the "new" label so hard to read?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's even worse on my screen, agree it needs loooking at.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suspect that this question made Jeff realize that the link was not here on meta, since it's suddenly here, and "new"! Which was not the case last night when I wrote this up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I found that removing the CSS shadow on that text helps. http://i.imgur.com/b8qij.pngb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I figured that might be the case. Definitely looks much more readable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it's a problem with text-shadow. i'll remove it for this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can this be marked as answered?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will review that tomorrow when a blog post goes up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Erm, no, this can't be marked as answered, because there is no answer. [edit] But there is now.


















When I switch between Main and Meta within the same browser, the layout changes slightly, most noticable when viewing my reputation scores, where the icons move over further to the right on the main screen, and the drop down arrows are truncated as it their DIV was not large enough to accomodate the icon, ir is misaligned vertically.  I have tried to show this in the following screen grab edit - the top one is Meta, the bottom one is Main.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the CSS different between Main and Meta?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I notice this too, on Safari 5.1.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i'm looking into this. structure wise they should be the same. if not, then it's a bug.



















On August 17, 2010, exactly one year ago today, Ask Different (then called Apple) launched into private beta.
In the past year we’ve seen phenomenal growth. We now have:

7k questions
13.5k answers
9k users
13.5k visits per day (average)

I just wanted to say a big “thanks” to everyone that has helped us get here today, from the people that believed in the potential of this site when it was only an http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/151/appleArea 51 proposal, to those early adopters that helped make our private and public betas successful, culminating in our launch as a full, permanent part of Stack Exchange earlier this year, to https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/6/jinJin, our site designer who perfectly captured the balance between Apple’s and Stack Exchange’s design aesthetic, and finally to our loyal users, who have been tirelessly helping to answer nearly any question thrown their way.
Here’s to many years to come!
p.s. - you early adopters should start to see your https://apple.stackexchange.com/badges/52/yearlingyearling badges soon!

Kyle--

I just want to say congratulations on founding what has turned out to be an absolutely wonderful site, one that I feel follows Stack Exchange's ideals. I know we are all proud to help carry this site from beta to live, but you should be more so for having having the foresight and gumption to get everything started. Thank you for your lasting (and hopefully permanent) contribution to the Apple community as a whole.

I look forward to working with you, the mods, and the community on the continued growth of the site.

We rule.

The sidebar ad will not appear on questions until questions have more than 1 answer.

This is to

After performing a search in the search bar the search terms remain in the bar.  If you click in the bar to change the search terms, the first character you type is inserted where you clicked but the cursor then moves to the end of the line and anything you type goes here instead.  

Firefox 3.6.18 on Windows XP Pro SP3

Instructions to reproduce:  


Type search term 'break key'  
Hit Enter  
Page of results loads with 'break key' still in search box  
Click mouse in front of the 'b' in 'break' and start to type 'macbook'  
'm' appears in front of 'break key' making 'mbreak key' and then the search box expands  
cursor moves to the end of the search string 'mbreak key' resulting in 'mbreak keyacbook'

No repro in Chrome. What browser?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Threadhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Thread


  A thread (sometimes called a topic) is a collection of posts, usually displayed from oldest to latest, although this is typically configurable: options for newest to oldest and for a threaded view (a tree-like view applying logical reply structure before chronological order) can be available. A thread is defined by a title, an additional description that may summarize the intended discussion, and an opening or original post (common abbreviation OP, which can also mean original poster) which opens whatever dialogue or makes whatever announcement the poster wished. A thread can contain any number of posts, including multiple posts from the same members, even if they are one after the other.

It can mean the Original Post (most common, IMO), and Original Poster, referencing the user specifically. I can't think of any other abbreviations at this moments, but there are many more relational terms, such as;

The parent (the commenter/poster one level above), grand-parent (two levels above), and occasionally but not-often, sister/brother/sibling. Note that most of these relationship terms are only used on sites that have threaded comments such as Slashdot, Reddit, and some blog systems. Not so much SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A somewhat less common but perhaps more clear term would be TC, for thread/topic creator. It removes the ambiguity of referring to the post or poster, but at least as far as SE is concerned, OP seems to be the more widely used term.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just for comparison, I’ve been using OP to mean Original Poster since around 1995 and I never noticed anyone use it to mean Original Post, specifically, but in many cases it works either way, so I wouldn’t know if I interpreted it differently from the author.

From https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#bountythe FAQ:

There are a few other rules around bounties:

Questions must be at least 2 days old to be eligible for a bounty.
Users must have at least 75 reputation to offer a bounty.
There can only be 1 active bounty per question and per user at any given time.
Once initiated, the bounty period lasts 7 days.
After starting a bounty, you must wait 1 day before awarding it.
If you do not award your bounty within 7 days, the highest voted answer created after the bounty started with at least 2 upvotes will be awarded half the bounty amount.

Feature Request: Add editor buttons for symbols common to the subject being discussed.

In the case of the Apple Stack Exchange, I wish to suggest some buttons for the editor to insert the common keys and symbols used by the Apple platforms. This would mainly be the modifier keys that Mac OS and Mac OS X make extensive use of, as well as perhaps a few other symbols common to computer keyboards.


Key: Symbol - Unicode Symbol Name
Command Key: ⌘ - Place of Interest Sign
Shift Key: ⇧ - Upwards Right Arrow
Option Key: ⌥ - Option Key
Alt Key: ⎇ - Alternative Key Symbol
Return Key: ⏎ - Return Symbol
Delete Key: ⌫ - Erase to the Left
Escape Key: ⎋ - Broken Circle
Eject Key: ⏏ - Eject Symbol
Control Key: ^ - Circumflex Accent (included for completeness)
Tab Key: ⇥ - Rightwards Arrow to Bar
Up Arrow: ↑ - Upwards Arrow
Right Arrow: → - Rightwards Arrow
Left Arrow: ← - Leftwards Arrow
Down Arrow: ↓ - Downwards Arrow


This would allow users to enter the correct symbol for a key function without having to remember it's name (how many names have you heard ⌘ referred to?) and not have to hunt through a unicode table to find it.

If I were to answer a question like "What are the common keyboard commands in Mac OS X" I could quickly answer:


⌘O - Open
⌘W - Close
⌘Q - Quit
⌘Z - Undo
⌘X - Cut
⌘C - Copy
⌘V - Paste
⌘A - Select All
⌘? - Get help
⌘, - Preferences


Or if asked "How do I close all tabs but the one I am on (Safari)"


  Just hit ⌘⌥W to close all tabs other that the current tab in a window.


This could also help with a question like "How do I type an Umlaut on a Mac?"


  To add and umlaut, press ⌥U+u (or any letter supporting one, ä, ï, ë, ö, ü, Ü, etc).

If a moderator flag is deemed to have merit, your flag weight will go up. If a moderator flag is deemed not to have merit (or if we determine that no action is needed) your flag weight will go down. I believe it's mostly linear, with an asymptotic approach towards 750.

Using review is a way to find posts that need moderator attention (and thus, can be flagged appropriately)

Does the reviewing itself earn you weight, or is it flagging posts while reviewing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@daviesgeek When a moderator gets a flag, they get an option as to whether or not the flag is valid. How the moderator votes results in either an increase or decrease in the flag weight of the flagger.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's still not answering my question.

In general, any "announcement" type question will be just a /questions/tagged/discussiondiscussion post. Given the level of activity usually prevalent in them, they often solidify their presence on the Meta Sidebar ad you get on the main site, for the duration that they are important. It's the list on the right that starts off with "Visit Meta".

If it is exceptionally important or expects to be such for a while, there is a moderator-only tag /questions/tagged/featuredfeatured. This locks the post to being at the top of the Meta Sidebar ad on the main site as long as the tag stays (which is at least 2 weeks). If there is a big announcement that's important that people should see, this will be used.

I have quite a few posts, but my problem is that the oldest posts show first. Can I order my posts so the newest ones show up first? Or is that not possible? If it isn't possible, can this be added?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is is possible to order my posts by recency?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I read the title as "Is it possible to order my posts by regency?" and I was wondering what the regency of a post could be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kiam It would be ordering your posts by "The office or period of government by a regent." :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did a bit of a double-take at first also, but then I thought: "recency – what a terrific word". A new one on me, but one to note (even if it doesn't seem to be in the dictionary – it should be, though).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DublinJimbo Thanks!


















You should see buttons that let you do this.

Would it be helpful to add a polling feature to Ask Different? I was talking to Nathan Greenstein in the chat room about web browser shares among Mac users, which led me to post this. I am not sure how useful it would be to have a feature like this. If you downvote this post could you please let me know why you downvoted it. It's helpful to have feedback as to why you think a feature request isn't a good idea.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Polling featureb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm voting this up since it's a good thing to ask, not that I agree we should have polls.  I of course up voted the answers that explained _why_ polls are less than welcome here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Thanks! I got three (three!) downvotes with no one explaining why they downvoted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm voting up, because poll questions are the only way to get a median feedback of a group. So far, there is no way to form an answer by collective opion ([wisdom of the crowds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)). Also, I do not understand this comment: *...under the stipulation that no one can earn reputation from them, you've strongly discouraged these sorts of questions...* Isn't this merely a personal option? It's essential to not earn reputation off poll questions, because the answer of a poll question does not lie in the quality but in the **option** of the collective!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt The polls would be strictly biased towards the collective opinion of this community (ie. potentially not relevant for the casual googler); or actually it wouldn't even represent the opinion of this community, but the opinion of those who answered the poll. I think the best way to conduct a poll on this site is to use some kind of online tool (Google Docs, for example) and then bring up the poll in chatroom, where it can be answered and discussed. Let the main site be for factual questions & answers; not for some pseudo-factual polls ("this is a fact because it is the median feedback").


















To address the question in the title, your question will not get deleted unless specifically done so by a moderator.

I closed the question for two reasons. The first is in the reason I selected, specifically...


  "this question will likely solicit opinion, debate, arguments,
  polling, or extended discussion"


The question was clearly subjective (asking for people's individual opinions) and in quick order enabled the virus and culture debates, neither of which end well. That type of discussion has no place here (and in the Stack Exchange format in general). Normally, I would have deleted it, but since it received both answers and votes, I simply closed it.

The second is because this is the type of community wiki question that acts as a black hole for what could more than likely be individual questions to be asked. The accepted answer contained at least a couple of topical points that would have been more useful to the community as questions. Rather than listing what will be "missed", these really should be asked along the lines of "I used to [insert favorite Windows function here]. What is an equivalent in Mac OS X?" The question wasn't necessarily a true collaborative effort, but rather it was just a polling question.

Please see Grace Note's post on the blog for a more detailed explanation about how community wiki is supposed to work: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/The Future of Community Wiki.

I understand what you mean about it being a polling question and how it could have been broken up into specific questions. I am glad to hear that the answers that were helpful won't be deleted.


















The site wants to wait until enough of a sample is present.

http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/new-question-asker-features/The official criteria of accept rate display is a little involved, but basically you need a few quality questions (after some question types are filtered out) before it shows your rate.

I did! My swag arrived a short while ago. Thanks to the whole team for making StackExchange into an awesome places for an awesome community!

Our version-specific OS tags use the 'big cat' name of the OS release.

10.4 -> tiger  
10.5 -> leopard  
10.6 -> snow-leopard  
10.7 -> lion


Use one of these when you have a question that's OS-specific.
When your question is not OS-specific, use the generic osx tag.

Tags should not be used just to tell us what version of the OS you're using; add that to the question itself.

Examples:

"How can I rename Desktops in Lion?"
Desktops (Spaces) changed a lot in Lion; this is a very Lion-specific question.
[lion]

"Error when connecting to my Mac with SSH"
This is a general troubleshooting question. While it may be useful to know the OS, it isn't a question specifically about that OS.
[osx], version info in the question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was referring to those. The question is when they should be used: Should I use them when I ask something that is specific for an OS version, or just to report I am using a specific OS version?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I understand now. Updated.


















Ask Different seems to be one of the larger and more popular SE sites, yet the voting is on par with some of the smallest in-beta sites. Other than the hyper-popular "your favorite tip/trick" type question, it looks like most questions get between 0-3 votes and seems like answers get that as well. Even many accepted answers seem to only 1 or 2 votes.

Is there a way to encourage people to vote more often to encourage better answers and more competition among answers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why does Ask Different have such a low voting percentage?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On a related note, I feel this is also related to the fact that we have just 2 10K+ users, and why we drop below 1K on the second page of users, not to mention the fact that we get to the 1-2K range on the first page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One guideline to go by when using any of the SE sites is that if the question was good enough for you to answer it, then it was worthy of a vote up. If those who answered a question would vote up a question, I think the numbers would look very different.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is the same problem we have on _Drupal Answers_, where high reputation users are less than in sites like _Stack Overflow_, or _Super User_.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, but it is not just the questions. Even answers on most questions seem to have 1 or 2 votes a lot of the time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, I see many, many question that go un-voted, with several answers that are upvoted, but _no one has upvoted the question!!_ And @Philip people need to know more about that! (If the question was good enough for you to answer it, upvote it!)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a relatively new user of the site, I didn't realize that was a "best practice". Will start to do so from now on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, completelt agree here. Most of my answers have only 1 upvote on them although they are accepted or said to be working. And out of my 18 questions, only 2-3 have a positive score (which is 1)...


















One standing problem comes to mind;

I honestly feel that too little expertise visits this site. One of many reasons for this is that it's all cooped up in Super User. The subject matter of Ask Different and Super User overlaps, at least with regard to Desktops, and there are many many more users over there.

I need not say that plenty of talent exists here, but they are too few in number to reach the scope of as many questions we get, not for lack of trying.

There is a standing issue on this topic. Apple questions about Desktop functions (as opposed to iOS) will remain on Super User, because they are not off topic. Users do often vote/flag to move any/all Apple questions to Ask Different, and iOS questions are automatically (iOS, like Android/WebOS/Windows Phone 7, are all off-topic at Super User).

For a number of reasons; rep, history, etc. Too many users remain at Super User. Questions have moved there (and once to Server Fault, for a OS X Server question) because there was no suitable answer here on Ask Different.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there really a wealth of Mac expertise on Super User?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/osx

It always seems like it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've been trying to watch the questions tagged OSX (and all the Lion / SL / etc...) on SU and here. I don't really see a qualitative difference of the questions being asked or answered. Most questions are very basic, marginally researched, often duplicates. I don't know what the volume of mac questions is between the sites for the last three months, but I don't see much expert involvement in either place due to the quality of the questions. Until the "experts" step up to the plate, it's hard to know where they lurk.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If that's the case, why not close them to enforce a "higher bar" for asking questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would certainly like to see the mods here take a stronger, more timely, and more proactive line on weeding out and closing poor-quality questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I admit that I hate flagging for low quality reasons, so that bar for me is ridiculously low. It just seems insulting, with some sympathy points given to non-english users.

But on the flip side, I've found myself avoiding the site because I have to wade through the low-rep, tiny, no detail questions.

I guess I'll start flagging these things with less hesitation. Mods can always ignore (decline?) the flag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see much down side to flagging and closing more marginal questions. The author gets _direct_ feedback on why it's not answerable/useful in the larger scheme. It still can be improved, seen in search, and reopened once it's been refined or otherwise dialed in. Especially on second or thirds marginal questions when I can leave a comment pointing out specific areas that could make it better... In the end - it matters not if SU has more expertise or we do - we can still curate new questions more carefully with the tools present today.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wait, can closed questions be edited? I love trying to salvage unclear questions, but I didn't realize that questions can be improved once they had been closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about questions like:

http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25019/how-to-simulate-right-click-in-apple-macbook-pro

I mean simply googling "right click mac" will give one more than enough information about a topic like that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lemonginger That question was IMHO a perfect example of the "very basic, marginally researched, often duplicates" question referenced above. Yet it gets 6 upvotes and 4 answers. Sheesh.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Allowing cross-posting of questions between Ask Different and Super User would be a great feature.


















I consider myself a Mac expert in general, and I'm often not inclined to answer for a variety of reasons. The "very basic, marginally researched, often duplicates" stuff @bmike said is one. Some of that is new-user laziness, and I don't know what can be done on that.

The super-tweaky "How do I do this incredibly arcane thing in Terminal" questions put me off, because I'm not a command-line guy. Related are the answers that unnecessarily recommend a command-line approach (the "I've got a hammer called Terminal, and I shall use it to strike every nail" approach). I think those command-line Q's and A's tend to put off most Mac users, who have no interest in using Terminal, ever in their lives. I don't mean to offend you Terminal jockeys, really. But my 27 years of Mac experience tells me that people generally become Mac users because they don't want to deal with that kind of stuff.

There are certainly questions over on SuperUser that should be over here on Ask Different. That's an issue that I think is in SE employee's bailiwick (no, I'm not speaking for Dori here). I feel there is some cherry-picking of questions by the mods there, and they are holding onto questions that would find a good home here. 

By the way, I've only started doing the "vote questions up that I answer" thing on a regular basis recently, partly because it seemed to me that it was a kind of logrolling, and I wasn't clear that it was not only permitted, but encouraged behavior.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, I have no problems with arcane Terminal questions. While people that like the Unix based underpinnings of OSX may not be the majority of Mac users, they are a significant part and tend to have high quality questions and high quality answers (and can help on the "easier" questions, so attracting them and keeping them seems like a good thing to do.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love that you are calling out answers that "go terminal" more because it's the best in the view of the answerer and not necessarily what the OP wants. I've personally fallen into that trap several times where I end up with a great answer - but not to the question asked so I have to go find that question (or ask it myself) rather than spew something that is correct in it's own merits, but _still wrong in relation to the specific question at hand._ To get my vote, a good answer has to be "correct by itself" and "appropriate for the asker's situation / frame of reference".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Would you please consider running for mod sometime in the future? I like the cut of your jib.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lemonginger Please note that I'm not saying Terminal related questions shouldn't be welcome here. I'm saying that as a longtime Mac user (and a "super user" at that), they put me off. And I suspect that to new users who have never seen Terminal, they are even more off-putting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! I'm still new to the whole SE as anything but an occasional lurker. Thanks to voters, I've got a fair amount of the moderator tools already on this Apple corner of things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike If there are two ways to answer a question (Terminal and GUI) I would prefer to include both approaches. This is because I prefer to think of two audiences when answering questions: the original asker and anyone else who may have a similar question. There will more than likely be someone from both camps in the audience for any general question.


















In two days your question will cease to be promoted as a bounty question. However, you are given an extra day to select your bounty answer before one is selected automatically.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I understand correctly, the sentence in the question page says "ending in two days" because an answer given after 3 days is not eligible for the bounty, while the bounty effectively expires after 3 days, which means I cannot anymore select to which answer I give the bounty. Is it correct?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kiamlaluno from everyone else's perspective, the bounty ends in 2 days, but you have an additional day, so that's why the system was telling you that you had 3 daysb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ooh - that is subtle. The expiration time for me to award the bounty is different than the public promotion period. A very nice touch despite the confusion.


















My take is they absolutely are on topic (and should be as well).

1) This site explicitly is about apple services - one of which is Apple's repair service. The average user might reasonably ask some basic question about how to understand the makings of the product so as to weigh their options.

2) Apple hardware is totally on topic. This user has a specific, definite problem they are seeking so solve and it involves iOS hardware.

If you take the long view - six months from now - having an unanswered question that is good, clear and on-topic isn't really a problem. I have found great questions to answer that have been here for 8 months or more. It's up to the OP to promote the question, be patient or flag it to move if another site has a better shot at asking.

In this case - I happened to know the answer - but even if I didn't - there are many people here who have had their phone break and could share their experiences. Some may have done a glass repair and could share their triumph or tale of woe. In the end - the OP was able to realize paying for a local tech was worth the money to minimize his risk / time to DIY.

Try it again.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Totally - same rationale - the user didn't explicitly say why they needed to know 000 vs 00 - but a 00 is needed to properly open a user-accessable bottom case. I don't know of any 000 screws offhand that Apple expects a user to adjust - but it's a great question as well from where I sit :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I get it now!


















If you look on the right of the users page, you'll see something very similar to:

Part of the problem as I see it is being stuck in a "low-vote" trap. If good answers tend to get 1 or 2 votes, people won't vote them up after that. Same with good questions. It requires some consistency in trying to set new standards for good with questions and answers getting 10+ votes if they are well researched and presented.

It is really frustrating for new people stopping by (including me) to take the top to write out an answer and get no feedback, sometimes not even from original poster who never bothers to check back.

And I agree with trying to cull the low quality questions, some days it seems as if over 25-50% of the questions could be answered with a simple google search.

Rather than just giving the answer, maybe just giving example search terms, or an idea of what preference pane to look at?

THe FAQ makes it clear that prerelease software requiring an NDA is off-topic for the site. But not all pre-release software requires an NDA. Is pre-release software that doesn't require an NDA an allowable topic?

For example, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24982/installing-windows-8-preview-on-a-macInstalling Windows 8 Preview on a Mac? was closed as off topic, but at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516, one can download the Windows 8 preview without any NDA.

Here's my view on this:

The reason to disallow questions about prerelease software is not the NDA. It's not our job to enforce that. If users want to break their NDAs that's their choice.

Rather, the reason that I think we shouldn't allow these questions is that many of them are simply too localized.
Things change very quickly with prerelease software, so a question and answer that work today are likely to be broken, or not even relevant, tomorrow.

I'm in favor of updating the FAQs to block all questions about prerelease software, not just those under NDA.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've talked with one of the other moderators, and we've updated the FAQs to reflect this view: "It is not about... pre-release or beta software"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For link purposes: [Update to FAQ regarding beta and pre-release software — Ask Different meta](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/573/8546)


















Some pre-release software is transient and likely too localized a question because it will too-soon become obsolete. Other times, software languishes for years in pre-release form. (Google's perpetual betas are one example; many open-source projects also exhibit these symptoms). A question about a developer preview that will in days or months be superseded by an official release likely should be off-topic, I'd think. But I'd hate for this rule to keep us from being able to answer questions about any beta software, or stable but slowly developing solutions to real problems people might develop.

This isn't a clear bright line, which is unfortunate, but I do think it's an important distinction.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that there is a fine line between betas that are buggy, incomplete, and subject to rapid change and betas that are largely stable and widely used. Part of this has to do with the industry, led by Google, to keep the "beta" label for years during which the software is feature-complete and experiencing only iterative improvements. Still, I think it's important to have the clause in the FAQ disallowing beta questions as we can simply not enforce it in situations where the "beta" is really a stable product.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To tie it in with the question in question, Windows 8 has been out for about a week - this is certainly not enough time to determine if compatibility and behavior are stable, and that's why I agree that the closure was warranted. It might be useful to revisit this particular issue in a few months to see what's developed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the important distinction is stability -- not in terms of not crashing, but in terms of not changing rapidly. If something is buggy and incomplete, but it doesn't change rapidly, an answer about how to get it working in a particular context could be very helpful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it's abandonware then I agree, but most bugs on active software projects get fixed eventuallyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, absolutely in terms of outright bugs. But I don't see any reason why an open source project that hasn't hit a 1.0 release should be any less on topic than one that has. I agree that Windows 8 Developer Preview questions will become obsolete too quickly to be helpful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Towards a clear bright line* … **Apple products**: consider [whether Apple provides an area for public discussion of an Apple product](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/1268/854).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5… **Third party products**: an example, I expect Windows 8 to be **not** discussed in Ask Different until after Apple adds support for that version of Windows to Boot Camp. Without that support from Apple, Windows will be too off-topic from OS X.


















I'm noticing a new trend regarding posting software prices alongside their titles.  I'm not sure how it started, or where it came from, but why in Jobs' name would we want to do this??  

Prices are constantly changing, and it makes the site look irrelevant and obsolete quicker than just about any other trend I've seen.  People use different formatting, and lets not even get into the problems associated with USD vs EUR vs Yen, etc.

I see no need for this considering the convention is to provide a link to the software developers page anyway, which would contain the most up to date pricing.

Can we please stop this before it permeates too many threads?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are we including prices in software suggestions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you provide examples, please? Obviously if the question is, "What's a good cheese-cataloging app for under $100?" such answers would be warranted... Of course, such a *question* should probably be closed as too localized for the reasons you've given. If folks are throwing prices into answers where they're not relevant, I see no reason why they couldn't simply be edited out...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I completely agree, price is localized and subject to change. Best to just get rid of it completely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it helps somewhat, The chances of me clicking through to see the software recommendation are greatly influenced by price. If it is not something I can afford or want to spend I wont click. I agree that as price changes information will quickly become out of date.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I hate when I see a reference to a piece of software without a price attached. Is it free? Is it $0.99? Is is $100? Prices may change, but I bet most don't change substantially, other than temporary sales. People are smart enough to realize that prices may change, and if they are interested enough, they'll check it out to see if it has changed, or maybe use one of the app price checking apps. As for units, well, I'm guessing most people are going to assume USD unless something else is specified.


















This is unenforceable. Deleting the prices would require us to review every single answer to every product-related question. Given everything else that goes on around here with the moderator flags, this is a niche problem that would be nice to manage but doesn't harm the site overall.

UPDATE per comment:
If the high-rep community members are willing to step up and update or delete prices from answers, the mods (or at least I will be) more than happy to approve any edits the community agrees upon. 

Otherwise, nice to manage is vastly different than actually managing it. Back to my original point, I don't see prices in answers as being all that significant relative to the other issues that crop up on a regular basis, so this isn't anything that I will actively address except to approve others' edits.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that it shouldn't be a moderator problem, but I also agree with your statement that it would be nice to mangage.  I think it's a good topic for discussion because who knows how many people are actually doing this intentionally vs just following a trend.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@calavera: I have updated my answer per your comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've used prices a number of times in replies already, and never thought about it.  Localisation is perhaps more of an issue than the fact that they are subject to change, every answer is subject to change when apps are updates, bugs fixed, and new bug introduced.  If anything the only thing I think would be good to use is to try to encourage appropriate wording like "currently priced at", to show that along with all content, the information is relevent at the time it was provided.


















Both in chat and when posting comments, an autocomplete box shows up for users.

Can this be made so you can select the user using the up arrow key, then the right/left arrows? So, let's take the example above. I push the up arrow to highlight "memilanuk", then the right arrow key to highlight "mankoff", and press Enter to select "mankoff". I hope this makes sense...but could it be implemented? I find it somewhat annoying that I have to use the mouse to select the name.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can the username autocomplete be keyboard accessible?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@balpha Thanks so much!


















OK, moderators have officially been mailed the form to obtain the cards. Stay tuned!

  Are flags encouraged that indicate that a comment is actually an
  answer to the problem?


Sure, but it would be faster to simply @ the commenter and tell them to make their comment an answer. That's what we would do; it is all we can do, per my answer to your second question.


  If we read comments that actually propose a solution to the problem,
  should we flag them as "not a comment" for a moderator to reclassify
  as an answer?


We do not have the ability to switch comments to answers; we can only switch answers to comments (and I've done that a fair number of times). All we can do in that case is simply @ the commenter to ask them to add their comment as an answer. Veterans of Stack Exchange typically oblige, but people new to the culture typically don't and we are stuck.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That was my core question: I knew you had the ability to turn answers into comments, and didn't know if you had the reverse superpower.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've thought the same thing. It's kind of an awkward social situation. There's a nice answer there for the posting - so that it fits "our" vision of how the site should be structured, but we are trained to not speak for others - let them get credit for their "answer".


















A few days ago Stack Exchange set up a blog for Ask Different at http://apple.blogoverflow.com/http://apple.blogoverflow.com/, and we're looking for contributors! The topic set is the same as Ask Different - reviews, comparisons, and how-tos with https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#questionsApple hardware/software, etc. You can also write posts about Ask Different itself - how to ask a good question, how to use site features, and featuring excellent questions or answers from the site. And if you have a great idea of something to contribute that I haven't listed, just let us know and we'll let you know if it's something we can put up.

If you haven't already, I suggest looking at the http://blogoverflow.com/other Stack Exchange community blogs to get a sense for what the blog will be like, and to get ideas for potential content to post.

The primary means of communication is our chat room, which is open to the public:

http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1408/ask-different-bloghttp://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1408/ask-different-blog

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in contributing to, either selectively or on a regular schedule, or even if you're just curious and want to know more, please just drop a line either here or in the chat room and we'll get you hooked up with a contributor account on the blog and give you access to our Trello planning board.

Let's make it awesome!

If the community votes for one answer over another, then that's just going to happen. Whenever I, personally, see two answers that are identical, I vote for the answer that is given by the person with the lower reputation; others will see the situation differently. I see where you're coming from, but that is just the way the system works with people involved. I don't think the mods should step in and "fix" things like this. Just keep plugging away at it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's a nice thing to do for the n00bs; Maybe I should just create a bot that follows you around and duplicates answers? heh. In the meantime I'll keep plugging away as you say. ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ioi - you will win some and lose some with the ties - but editing a similar question into shape is good practice (and others will similarly help your answers over time) - you will certainly get tons of rep here based on what you're writing already. Good stuff - keep it coming is how I see it :-)


















Part of the problem is that it appears to the community that the answers were posted at the same time. Since times are displayed as "19 hours ago", it looks like your answer and the other one came from the same time.
Yes, you can hover over that to see the exact time, but many people don't know how/don't bother to do this.

This means that people upvote answers based on the one they like better. If one has something to make it a little nicer than the other, that one will get votes (even if it was posted later than the other).

This is compounded by the fact that answers with upvotes float to the top. That means that some people will go to the question, see the answer with upvotes because it's at the top, and upvote it. They may never see the other answer because it hasn't floated to the top, or they may just decide to upvote the one that already has upvotes.

Bottom line, there's not a lot you can do about it. The only way to go is to make sure your answers are so high-quality that people will upvote yours over others!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with much of what you're saying, and it's nice to know others are aware of the intricacies you've pointed out. I realize that rep and flair is a big part of what SE is about, however, that can equate to the "correct answer" being determined by popularity, not quality. Hence, mediocre or inaccurate answers getting up-votes or even worse (You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours philosophy).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like how over time, the voting works out best - thousands of little nudges help make a good reputation (and the down votes really do help know what to do better in the eyes of some). The beauty, is everyone can only vote once - so in a week or a month - the real balance does tend to come out as long as people [**vote for kittens!**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/vote-for-this-question-or-the-kitten-gets-it/)


















Diamond mods can migrate questions to sites not on that list.  They (hopefully) only do this in consultation with the receiving site's moderators unless it's a very obvious case, a very high-quality question, and they've checked for duplicates.

We (SE) will not approve migration paths willy-nilly.  The hard truth is that too often, users migrate questions to sites where a duplicate already exists or where the question isn't actually on-topic.  Additionally, there's a tendency to migrate garbage questions that should be closed as a way to get rid of them without risking hurting the asker's feeling by closing -- thus simply moving problems around so someone else has to deal with them.

Migration paths are only created when there is a history of many good migrations having happened between site A and site B.

If your moderators and the SO moderators think the question belongs on SO, it will make it there (perhaps slowly, as the mods need to find one another online to discuss it).

  ...are iPhone 4S questions off limits until Apple actually ships them?


Now that it has been announced, I think that makes it on-topic. Apple has a nice product page to pull some answers from (though any question might get closed as being easily answerable via the page). 

As to the quality of that answers you are going to get, that's something else completely since it hasn't been shipped and no one has it in their hands yet.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, they're now on topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But what questions can we answer at this point? There's what's posted on Apple's page (so read the page), and then there's the raft of "why did Apple do x, y, or z" questions. The information that's *known* at this point is so small, I'd argue that we're unlikely to get *good*, *answerable* 4S questions until people actually have more information than what's on Apple's product page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions about things posted to Apple's web pages are not necessarily bad questions. Obvious perhaps, in some cases. But some legitimate questions could be of sufficient quality to keep around and answer with a high degree of detail.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel: I completely agree with you on all your points, but we have to draw a line somewhere. From my perspective, it is much easier to enforce "beta" than it is "announced but not yet shipped." By announcing something, Apple makes it open to discussion. That creates a very distinct line we all can work from.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @PhilipRegan for clarifying. I agree there's a distinct line, and I'm in favor of distinct lines. I do think we're on precisely the wrong side of the distinct line. Beta software (without NDA) we can get actual information about and answer questions helpfully. Vaporware hardware we just have manufacturer information about. But I agree that a clear policy is much better than a lack of a clear policy, and I can certainly run with this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel: Beta software invariably has an NDA attached to it, particularly Apple who is particularly strict about violation. We cannot place the community in jeopardy like that, good intentions or otherwise. Please see this question for detailed discussion: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/573/212b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PhilipRegan But that wasn't the basis of the decision [here](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/798/pre-release-software-that-doesnt-require-an-nda). Beta software (particularly non-Apple beta software) sometimes does NOT have an NDA attached to it, but the decision was to make it all off-topic for "too localized" reasons. I agree that we should be extremely careful not to put people in jeopardy for violating NDAs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel: It would be unreasonable for us to verify the existence of every NDA, and their terms, for every piece of pre-release software asked about (and sometimes we don't know if it is pre-release or not until someone flags the post). I don't agree with the logic put forth in Nathan's answer, but I do agree with yours that pre-release is oftentimes still transient in state and answers will change between beta releases and final. The policy is not that blunt an instrument, but some questions will suffer. Those are in the vast minority. NDAs are far too prevalent to assume otherwise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PhilipRegan Fair enough.


















http://www.mactech.com/MacTech runs a http://www.mactech.com/conference/aboutconference next month, and we have been invited to potentially participate. Basically, we want to put together some kind of small event that will let the people at the conference spend 15-20 minutes really engaging with the users on the site. We have had two ideas so far:


We could run a sort of "Stump the Programmer" style game that would be played at the MacTech Conference next month. Individuals would ask questions in the Ask Different chat, where a pre-planned group of awesome Ask Different users would already be congregating. The chat room's task is then to wow the crowd back at the conference with their skill and know-how by finding great answers quickly. 
The other idea is similar in that it would have an organized, coordinated chat effort, but it would involve some kind of competition between the chat team(s) and the in-person team(s) at the conference. 


What do you guys think of these ideas? Are these coordinated chat efforts something you would be interested in? What other ideas do you have in terms of ways we can integrate with MacTech?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should we do with MacTech?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this their first conference?

On Ask Different, content in a <pre> element that is wider than the box will cause the box to scroll (CSS overflow-x: scroll;).
On the Ask Different Blog, that doesn't happen. The too-wide content just overflows out of the box:

No, there is not a means for this to be done via the ui.  That option is part of our custom theme, but it isn't for enabling css to be changed by admins.

I'm not seeing a need to open this up.  I'd want to see a compelling case calling for it.

I've posted a banner


  Steve Jobs http://apple.com/stevejobspassed away on October 5th, 2011. Rest in peace.


I'm open to suggestions on the wording/links.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems pretty much perfect. Simple wording, apple.com/stevejobs is probably better than apple.com considering we don't know how long they'll leave their splash in place.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you. Just. wow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you. I would've removed the notification icon though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dan the system puts that there; I can't remove it. I agree, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMHO, you should link Steve Jobs' name to the page, not the words "passed away".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Cannot up-vote enough...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5why is there a tribute on stackoverflow but not here ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mcgrailm There was, but it expired. I re-enabled it.




















Is this supposed to be here? It doesn't fit with the colour scheme of Ask Different, and it appeared recently, without warning or explanation (that I could find).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this supposed to look different?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure if the bug tag is 100% fitting, but it seemed to be the best of the necessary tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is intentional and temporary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This should be permanent. I really like the dash of colors.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For a split–second I actually thought SE was acquired by Google. — But after reading the news I see the intended symbolism. *Kudos!* for the design.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the colors look nice. It reminds me of Apple's old logo.


















It's the colors of the original Apple Logo: 



It appeared with the update to the site design that added the "Steve Jobs passed away on October 5th, 2011. Rest in peace." line to the top.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did recognize the colours, but I wanted to be sure that it was intentional. The colour change actually happened afterwards, about 1 hour ago I was on here, had a normal menu bar, but the Steve Jobs update was there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mahnax yeah, it took a little while to make and deploy the design change


















I would like to contribute by reviewing iOS apps, if you think that's in scope for the blog.

You can author the post in Wordpress, then submit it for publication when you're done. I look forward to reading your reviews!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kalamane, I saw that you have a draft up and I wanted to offer a couple of suggestions for consistency with some of our work so far, and then just a few other requests I'd like you to consider. Could you meet me in the [Ask Different Blog Chat Room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1408/ask-different-blog) some time? I'll be in there around standard business hours tomorrow, and of course, a *little bit* later too :).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VxJasonxV I'm in the chat now.


















I just asked a question and noticed what I think is a bug.

When you view a question that you have asked, you see the "Know someone who can answer..." message at the bottom, as well as the "Would you like to have responses sent to you..." message. You also see the "Answer Your Question" button.



The bug is that the button is displayed kinda-sorta on the same line as the "Would you like to have" message.
I assume that those are meant to be on different lines (as they are on other sites).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Visual bug when viewing your own questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm looking into this


















I closed your iPhone question because of the discussion that came below it in the comments. By the time I got there, behind the scenes it was flagged three times and five mods—even some from community management—looked at it. It came on the day of Steve Jobs' death, emotions were still raw, and the overall discussion—public and private—was quickly diverting away from the original topic with one of the early comments. I don't like closing questions, but better safe than sorry.

As for the question itself, it is, at least at this point, unanswerable without a citation, and therefore would be considered not constructive. The question you linked to before has multiple citations in the answers, but Apple has become a lot more quiet over the past several years about the naming standards of their products. It's an interesting question, even if only a footnote in Apple canon, but not one that is going to get much in the way of a quality answer these days that the SE sites strive to achieve.

One unsolicited piece of advice that I will give is that what happened to you is has happened to even the best of us here, and to please keep on engaging the community. People will vote the way that they want, but the moderators have pretty clear guidelines as to what to do and you stumbled into a bit of a grey area, more on the murkier side of things. If anything, you found a new boundary for the community and that is always a good thing. 

I say, carry on as you were and welcome to the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No problem at all with the shut down per se, I'm just wondering whether it was bad timing and bad luck, or whether there was something radically different about the two questions that I missed. I really would like to know what the 'S' is for, and I'm sure there's an answer to be had. As for knowing whether there were citations like those for the 'i' question: there's no way to know that without asking.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Both bad timing and bad luck. Let me do some quick cleaning and I will re-open it. Gimme a minute.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks (though it may be a cursed question).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That may be true. It is open again. An answer to this would be interesting. I just don't think we're going to get one.


















Yes, the two questions were handled differently, for a good reason.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3313/what-does-the-i-in-apple-product-names-mean/3315#3315What does the “i” in Apple product names mean?

has an accepted answer that says:


  Apple declared the “i” in iMac to stand for “Internet”


and included a citation for that statement. 

In short: it was possible to give an accurate referenced answer to the question.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26837/is-there-an-official-policy-behind-the-s-in-iphone-4s-and-iphone-3gsIs there an official policy behind the 'S' in 'iPhone 4S' and 'iPhone 3GS'?

Let's start by looking at Stack Exchange policy, as given in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/Good Subjective, Bad Subjective and http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/Real Questions Have Answers:


  Constructive subjective questions:
  
  
  inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.
  tend to have long, not short, answers.
  have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.
  invite sharing experiences over opinions.
  insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.
  are more than just mindless social fun.
  
  
  …


How many of those are true about this question? Personally, I count zero.

Next, look at https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#dontaskthis site's FAQ:


  What kind of questions should I not ask here?
  
  You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.



Is the question practical? No
Is the question answerable?  No
Is the question based on an actual problem you face?  No


End result: This question is subjective, non-constructive, meaningless, and unanswerable—so it shouldn't be here.


If, at some future point, Apple did publicly release an official policy, it would then be an answerable question. But until then? Close it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, I understood completely, until this. Unless what your saying is that (based on the FAQ) neither question is appropriate, but the first one turned out to have an answer so it's OK. But how _this_ question ended up as not useful is beyond me.

When viewing the http://apple.blogoverflow.comAsk Different blog when logged in, the Dashboard/Navigation bar is visible. On page load, the profile tab (the tab with your name on it) opens until you move your mouse. It's a bit distracting, and I'm fairly certain it's not supposed to happen.

I recorded a quick video demonstrating the issue:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJoxt7M41SAhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJoxt7M41SA

Upon further examination, it appears to be happening on the main page, and a single blog post page. It does not happen on "pages" (like, http://apple.blogoverflow.com/for-podcast-guests/for podcast guests), nor the archive/about page.

I could resend the invite, but I don't think that would do any good


















I'd say usually it's a good idea to answer once. The software allows multiple answers (the "Add answer" button turns into a "Add another answer", and suggests combining, but permits a second answer to be posted. There are certainly multiple examples of questions with multiple answers (sometime I should revise this and include links, but I won't right now). But this question poses a case that is far from ideal, I would agree.

In the case you linked to, there are multiple questions asked in one question post. I answered twice because I was hoping the question would be split into two, and I'd move one of my answers to the second question. But since then I've been in dialog with the OP, and now I think the best solution is to revise the question, and then revise one answer (and delete the other). But we haven't done that yet.

I deleted your question. You left the access keys to a website in the code. They were deleted, but that simply moves the keys into the history, they don't get completely removed. Since there is no way for me delete a specific version of a question entirely, the entire question got deleted.

You may repost the question but without the access keys. Next time please take time to sanitize your code before posting it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks a lot for the correction. It was a good move from your side and I misunderstood. However, how am I supposed to find out that this was my mistake? There should either be an IM feature or a way for me to look at the comments of my posts, even the deleted ones. This will put a lot of pressure on the Database for all the extra records you need to keep and needs quite a bit of code change. So IM seems to be a good idea doesn't it? 
And yes, I'll take care to sanitize my code next time. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nitin There is no IM functionality in StackExchange, and never will be.  Put that thought out of your mind right now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Philip -- won't 10K users still be able to see the Q?  Is there a mechanism to get the question "truly" deleted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AdamRackis - I assume that's what Philip did, deleted the question completely to remove all trace of the defaulting part (thanks :)) and then re-posted it. Also, I accept that there won't be IM facility. But how do we get such things across to the defaulter (me in this case)? Perhaps the person editing the post should be allowed to send "some" notification (not an IM, something else) to tell the person their mistake. I'm sure not everyone will goto the meta of the StackSite to ask what happened like I just did...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nitin Neither Phil nor any other mod has the ability to physically delete a question.  Only system admins and only by special request.  As to IM, SE is not a social network, and the people that run it will never allow social networking features.  Situations like this are rare edge cases that are handled well enough on Meta, like you are here.


















I can write, but not too often (school...) as long as I have a topic to write about. I don't have Lion, and I don't have an iOS device, so I'm somewhat limited in what I can write about.

As far as topics, if nothing else, you could write about Ask Different itself - how to ask, the importance of voting, or even feature some great questions and/or answers that were posted recently


















This would be useful on occasion, I can't deny...

But the rationale is simply that comments aren't meant for tangential discussion. The author of the post you're commenting on is always notified, regardless of whether he's "@-replied" to explicitly in a comment. Responding to one of these comments requires only a single @-reply. Allowing comments to notify multiple people could result in obnoxious behavior or harassment.

As Diago notes, this has been discussed several times over on MetaSO - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/45273/allow-more-than-one-name-notification-per-commentthis is a good example. 

It's worth contrasting the design of comment @-notifications with those of http://chat.stackexchange.com/chat, where you can notify multiple users in a single message:


Comments always notify the post-author, regardless of @... Chat messages appear to anyone in the room.
Comments can @-notify anyone who has ever commented / edited the post... Chat messages can notify anyone who has been in the room recently.
Comment notifications persist in your global SE inbox... Chat notifications produce a small indicator within chat, with an entry in the SE inbox only if you don't respond.
You can only leave one comment every 15 seconds... You can post multiple chat messages within that timespan.


In short, chat messages will only notify people who are probably expecting them, having recently joined a chat room for the purpose of chatting. Comments might notify people who've long ago forgotten about the topic. Making it easier to mass-notify multiple users via comments has a much larger "harassment" potential.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Basically what most people would like to use comments for, the powers that be don't like. Annoying, but you can get round it by making a second comment with the 2nd person's name and some random characters following it, then when they reply you can delete it or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Right. Because the idea is to have a question, followed by one or more answers, without a lot of extraneous chit-chat in between them. There *is* [a full-on chat system available](http://chat.stackexchange.com/) if you need a lot of back-and-forth with someone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Compared to the main sites the chat sites aren't very used. Part of the point of StackExchange sites is to be a reference for people searching in the future, it's not a great reference if the discussion (which can help five an answer) is no longer there or is somewhere else you don't know about. Also the site hides long comment discussions so it doesn't create any mess.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Jonathan, you put your finger right on the problem of hosting long discussions on the main site: they're hidden. So it doesn't matter if there's some great conclusion arrived at eventually - the casual reader won't see it. For reasonably short discussions, the system's ability to "float" up-voted comments works pretty well, but before long you reach the point where the only good solution is to simply edit the answer to reflect the outcome. Which you can just as easily do in response to a conversation in chat (I've seen this done many times).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5but then one could say chat is even more hidden than the comments, and there is no chance at all of a comment on chat bring invited enough that it gets out of the hidden section. If the both places you can have a conversation are hidden and both will require the answer to be edited in order for the answer to be corrected, you might as well have the conversation in the easiest to unhindered place, in the comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Except that, as you noticed, comments are fairly *hindered*. Y'know - only one @reply at a time, gotta wait 15 seconds between posts, manual refresh...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However they are imposed limits and could easily be removed. It would be better if the comments became like chat. So you still have the general chat rooms for each site etc, but specifc question/answer chats are found below the relevant question or answer. Making the whole UX more fluid and less broken up. Make the comments real time, allow more than @reply, and remove the limit, exactly like chat. And instead of clicking a link to go a to a seperate chat site (with a different UI than most users know on SE sites), the link simply expands the comment section as it does now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, yeah, the comment system could have been expanded until it resembled what chat became... But that would have been a major, major change to the system - the system that is, after all, supposed to be centered around **Q&A**. I rather expect we'll see chat become more integrated into the site as time goes on, but there are significant challenges, both technical and social, to doing so properly. So for now, [comments are light-weight "Post-It notes"](http://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment), and if you want serious discussion try using Chat.


















https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28470/what-are-some-of-your-favorite-plugins-for-quicksilverThis question was closed due to not having a wide enough audience. I personally think that it should be reopened, as many people do use Quicksilver. What are your thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Considering reopening this questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Quasi-related: I mentioned to a friend how annoyed I am with Cracked. Their content is *passable*, but everything is a list, and it's obnoxious. I laugh at maybe one or two points, finish the article, look at the relateds, maybe try a few others, get annoyed, leave the site. To this day I only *sometimes* read Cracked if a friend explicitly links to it.


















I agree with Nathan. Although Apple.SE is very relaxed regarding the list rule, making one for every application out there is simply overkill, and to be honest, will most likely chase regulars away that want to answer high quality questions and find lists a distraction. 

FYI: This is what happened on SU and why we killed lists completely

As far as QuickSilver goes, it has been badly maintained and there has been great replacements out there like Alfred and LaunchBar, so do we know start a list for every one of these when there is already quite a few google-able resources out there that does have list of valuable plugins?

Do we really want to use list to get Google traffic which is simply just going to have users post questions to create more lists?

Dislaimer

I am extremely anti-list and personally feel it's an abuse of the SE system and principles to allow them. I will therefore admit this answer is biased.

Having many people that can explain why lists are bad helps to know when to kill them off and when to tolerate them if they do serve some good as well as the bad.


















I had problems with my iOS device, because it was running on iOS 5 Beta 7 and the device became unusable as the Beta expired. I had no idea what to do with it and how to restore it to normal mode, so naturally I turned to Apple SE for help and asked my question. 

The question was quickly closed as not appropriate because of the following: 

 Welcome to Ask Different! Questions about pre release software are off topic for this site. Please take a look at the FAQs for more info. 


I think the problem itself is a real problem that causes problems to iOS users. I find really disheartening these rules. They are discouraging me from asking questions related to apple. I feel that this rule is somehow in conflict with the sole purpose of the site. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Discussion of Beta software is against the FAQb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is a fine question and shouldn't be voted down. I think the answer is the FAQ is pretty clear this is for end users, people using shipping software and not for developers, but asking for clarification or explanation shouldn't just be down voted. (good thing you can't down vote a comment ;-)


















Actually your question was meant to be closed as a duplicate since it was asked earlier already, and that question was left open with the same warning.

The reason we do not allow questions around Beta software, specifically with regard to Apple, is due to the fact that all Apple Beta Software is under a strict NDA that every developer has to agree to when joining the program. Allowing one opens up a whole new set of issues. Also since Apple.SE is a public site, the last thing we need is Apple coming down on the site for allowing NDA material to be publicly released.

I have to be honest, since you brought it up and as a Apple Dev myself, how is it that registered developers are not aware that Betas expire, since every one of the iOS 5 betas did, nor that they were not aware that the GM was released more then 2 weeks ago and almost a week before the public received it to the devs? It bring the legitimacy of the question, in question, on that point alone. This problem will only occur when your a registered Apple Developer or you happened to get a copy of the IPSW of the beta through illegal means, and the latter we do not support, nor should we.

I don't see how this rule is in conflict with the purpose on the site, since there is already more then 95% of question not related to beta software?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I paid to be in the developer program, so I guess I obtained the betas legally. I am fairly new in the program, not a seasoned iOS developer as yourself. I refreshed the betas and the final build came to my device over the air, so I thought I am safe and the settings reported that I am on iOS 5. Much to my surprise my device was rendered unusable when the Beta 7 expired and I turned for help to this site. I guess my situation was not unique and others experienced the same issue with their devices. Instead of help, the questions got downvoted and closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@gyurisc 1. I am not a seasoned developer. 2. Both the email Apple sent to developers, and the iOS 5.0 release notes, apart from numerous news sites, made it clear the GM is **not** going to be available OTA and has to be installed via iTunes. 3. As a registered Apple developer you have access to the Apple Developer Forum, which handles all question regarding NDA developer issue, including the betas. The question got down-voted because the community respect the NDA all developers sign and agree too when joining the Apple Developer program.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@gyurisc I agree with Diago here. And from a technical point of view, "Beta 7" is still pre-release software even after iOS 5 is released, so it's off-topic.


















Flag these questions ( but only if you can't edit it yourself )

Post them to the chat room if you'd like editing help or a second opinion. 

Edit them mercilessly. (but kindly - leave a comment that you want the one true question to ring out and let the questioner know they can surely re-edit or ask again)

Attacking this is tough. Especially when you want to be kind to a new person, not assume you know what they have spoken, don't want to change their meaning.

But - the edit system allows them to revert things, tune your tune-up, and generally encourages everyone to step up and edit or at least flag it.

I think the tools are there if we all start using them. Have you seen a question where flagging or editing wasn't the appropriate way to handle this sort of generality?

Given how much they help, I wish there were some reward for them. I suppose there's badges for archaeologist, copy editor, and pundit; that's something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that it seems editing / commenting gets less rep. It certainly doesn't go un-noticed and a nice edit will make me go look and see what else you have answered / asked. So don't overlook the fact that a comment or an edit has a link back to your profile. ;-)


















I often find myself not uploading a screen capture from my iPhone since the default size of a retina sized picture is quite large.



In landscape it would be quite intimidating if the system didn't already scale it down...


Would it be possible to get the system to automatically tweak images uploaded to this site that match these exact iOS pixel sizes by default?

It would be best if the non retina devices looked like retina devices.

Optionally, you could add some text to the post so advanced users that really wanted the raw image size could over-rule it if you worried about that in practice?

This question shows how in practice, some editorial time is being taken to implement this in a less than standard way. https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1346/vxjasonxvJason has done a marvelous job of curating the pictures here, but perhaps a designer's eye could tweak or bless his choice of 200 pixels and assist everyone who uploads iOS standard screen shots so they all look the same on the site.

We are getting more and more questions about iCloud, and if you go through the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/icloudicloud you will find a lot of them relate to people misunderstanding iCloud and how it works, including backup.

On SU we handle these by creating a canonical question which we can use to close all these questions and not have to repeat the answers.

(I have answered a few of these and I often copy and paste from my previous answers)

Thoughts? Ideas? Should we do it?

My computer doesn't work!" -- and an answer that explains what kind of information is helpful to include so people can actually answer the question. Then we can close uninformative questions of this variety as duplicates, which will point to the tips on what information is actually needed.


















I would say no - don't close them unless they clearly are bad questions.

I was personally dissapointed that the "http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29377/which-macbook-pro-configuration-is-best-suitable-for-iphone-ipad-app-development" question got closed and will try to fix it and get it undeleted.

Even when the question is worded poorly (many of these are) and narrowly (the OP obviously is in the process of asking), I think there is a kernel of very important knowledge that is purely objective and should be questioned here to let people provide good technical answers.

Specifically, to develop iOS you have three major tasks:


initial design and layout of the app
coding and unit tests
running the iOS simulator
debugging and support


Portable macs have specific constraints that make the "design / layout" and "simulator" aspects of development problematic. Specifically, the iOS simulator wants to use 368 by 716 pixels for non retina devices, 690 by 994 pixels for retina devices and 765 by 994 for iPad simulation.

This really limits the effective use of say an 11 inch air unless you will have a monitor when you need to do the "design/layout" or want to edit code and read bug reports on the same screen as the simulator is running if you won't debug your code on an actual device and use the Mac's screen to do the dev half of the work.



So - the existing tools (flag, close, edit) work well to close questions that are vague, similar or exact duplicate or don't talk about objective Q/A. 

Any hardware recommendation question is prone to uncertainty / fragmentation based on the asker and answer's personal interpretation of:


cost ($4k for professional tools is a pittance if you forego $400k for an education. On the other hand, $4k for something that won't make you money for 6-16 months is a lot to spend on anything)
time (students/learners vs professionals)
expertise
timing (do you try to time your purchase or just buy knowing macs hold their resale and you can always get most of your money back if you want a new mac in 3 months time)


When these issues are mixed with a technical discussion, the quality of the question seems to devolve rapidly and I don't think a ban will be any more effective than current mod tools.

Thoughts?

You also have to distinguish between multiple questions and followup questions preemptively asked. For example, I usually ask questions like "What does X mean? If it means Y, what do I do? If it means Z, what do I do?". That form is OK, because it's stemming from a single primary question.

On the other hand, questions that aren't correlated should be edited. As it's impossible to split the question in the engine, my approach has been to keep the first question and remove the rest of them, and leave a comment requesting that they re-ask their other questions as separate questions.

This is not something that only moderators can do - anyone can suggest or make an edit removing the other questions, and the threshold for commenting is similarly very low. So flag them if you must, but I would be thrilled to see members of the community taking care of this kind of stuff themselves. This is not a matter of laziness, but the simple fact is that moderators don't scale, the community does.

The problem I have is when multiple questions are answered... I hate deleting good answers :)


















TL;DR Version

I have to admit, coming from SU where these questions were killed off early on (causing huge issues with the users, and even losing some because of it) the site survived and is still growing well without them.

Up until recently, I have been quite accepting of Apple.SE having a very lenient stance against these questions, however recent events have made me realize that it is going to burn Apple.SE in the long run.

Personally, I had planned to get very involved with Apple.SE going forward, however, my motivation has been significantly reduced as the quality of questions has dropped. It is unfortunate to see a CW question cap someone out on rep before the CW flag is hit, and some good quality answers, posted at the same, time getting no votes or views. 

I have lost interest in Apple.SE quickly, and doubt that I will be even remotely as active as before, since trying to increase the quality on the site sometimes feels one sided when this issue is raised, and honestly, it's raised often. 

Non TL;DR Version

Kill them and kill them quickly. It is going to make the road to success harder in the long run, and effectively drive away some users that could have added value. This point has been proven over and over again on other sites, and the traffic it is driving to this site is causing more damage than good.

Just noticed that the colour of the text displayed on the search results page does not show the search query very clearly until the search box is re-selected.

Blank search box waiting for a query:



Non-selected search box on results page:



Selected search box on results page



Perhaps the 2nd image (non-selected search box on results page) could at least be made to look like the placeholder text in the 1st image (blank search box), as it is often useful to view and edit a search query to improve results. If users are to be discouraged from editing a query using the top-right search box (and instead it is intended that they modify their query in the search box in the centre of the page above the results) perhaps the top-right search box should revert to just having place-holder text ready to accept a new query.

Jason had a nice comment in the chat room and I'd like to see if there is enough common interest to start killing these unanswerable questions off.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/5435/5472Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X?

This question specifically has no answer. Software can do anything our minds can describe and with tools as mature as the Lion terminal with commands like open and pbpaste and pipe etc.... there are really an unlimited number of cool things that you can do in terminal.

What is the practical problem trying to be solved here? What is the "answer".

I think we could pick one question like this and close it with a comment that although it contains great information - it's not in the one Q one A format and encourage people to craft a good question for each specific answer that needs to be copied over. If someone else sees the question before the asker gets a chance to answer - so much the better. In a short amount of time, imagine how many great questions could be around by "mining" these loose form collections for the best tidbits. 

Can this site curate great questions from ones like this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we try to start killing off the community poll questions with this one?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Completely agree, this could be a great way to distance ourselves from the CW-questions. I notice too many one-liner answers that don't bring anything to the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm all for community wiki **answers** - [like this one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23577/how-many-genius-mixes-are-there-in-itunes/23660#23660) - but I'm not even sure we need them with the lower thresholds for editing in place now. I've never gotten why a question needs a community to edit it. Answers, yes - but one or two edits and the question should be good to go for a good long time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the concept of a collection of tips, although it does not work with the current format in which questions and answers are structured. Sifting through ten pages is cumbersome; it becomes a total mess. It would be excellent if they could be indexed into an easy to browse format, however, it is not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a side note: I think a lot of the *answers* in that [Terminal](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5435/got-any-tips-or-tricks-for-terminal-in-os-x) question (and also in similar [Dropbox](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11859/what-are-some-great-os-x-dropbox-uses) question) are mostly off-topic, ie. not unique to OS X. (and should we start to flag the answers, I think they ought to be deleted more light–handedly than regular answers to good–old regular questions.)


















I'm new on Apple.SE, but I see nothing wrong with such questions on StackOverflow. Why do you want to kill it? Does it clog something up? The community clearly likes it; upvotes imply support. And surely you want the community to stay and bond through questions like that.

If it were voted into the negative then I suppose... But this one clearly doesn't warrant that kind of response, in my opinion.

I actually kind of like these questions (or rather the answers). The key benefit for me is that they contain a lot of interesting stuff in one place, especially a lot of things I would never have searched for explicitly but are good to know.

There are a few potential reasons:


You seem to have recently crossed over the threshold, so the badge simply hasn't been awarded yet. Some badges aren't awarded immediately, but instead with a batch script that's run daily.
You edit a lot of tag wikis. It's possible that the /users page tracks all edits, but the badge only counts edits to posts.
Maybe only edits to the content of a post are considered for the badge, and while you have 500 edits some are editing the tags of a question instead of the actual content of the post.


These are just speculations, but I'll bet that at least one is true. Just keep editing, you'll get it eventually :)

It's interesting that you ask this question, as this is one of the problems that exist with forums that SE was designed from the very beginning to mitigate against. The correct thing to do is simply to post another answer. People visiting the question needing an answer are likely to read all the answers anyway, including the up-to-date answer.

In cases where the number of answers is overwhelming enough to cause the new answer to disappear, an alternative is to post a comment on or edit the accepted answer or the answer that has the most votes.

Of course, I do this all the time. However, it should be done in a comment - your statement that you were down voted when you tried to request clarification leads me to think that you posted it as an answer. If so, that would be the reason why you were down voted, not the fact that you asked for the clarification.

The reason why the accept rate number is public is to provide those answering the question with the likelihood that the asker will accept an answer, possibly theirs. That withstanding, there's no rule that says that someone must accept answers to their questions.

However, the "Unanswered" tab lists questions with no accepted answer and no positively ranked answers. If you see a correct answer on a question in the Unanswered tab, upvote it. Actually, it's good practice to upvote any good, correct answer you see.

I ended up at https://plus.google.com/101120115153580954446/postshttps://plus.google.com/101120115153580954446/posts when I clicked the ad (same destination and largely identical content whether I am logged into a Google account or not).

The above-linked page seems to be a Google+ account for “Stack Exchange” to post various things: “interesting” questions from various SE sites (similar the http://twitter.com/stackexchangeSE Twitter account), but also podcast episode notifications, and some other SE-related news. It seems very similar to the http://www.facebook.com/stackexchangeSE page on Facebook.

Joel Spolsky recently https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/141912830462005248tweeted that “You can also follow Stack Exchange on Google+” with a link to a https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/Stack%20ExchangeGoogle+ search for “Stack Exchange” (this was right after he https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/141911133505335296tweeted about the symmetry of SE on Facebook and Facebook on SE: facebook.com/stackexchange, facebook.stackoverflow.com).

The ad itself seems to be just one of the SE-promoting ads that SE injects into its sites (questions from other SE sites, site proposals from Area 51, “Join us on Facebook”, “Join us on G+”, et cetera).

Since you asked, I tried my first URL in two browsers (Chrome, Firefox) that I usually do not use (and with which I have never logged into a Google account). I got the same result as a plain logout: the G+ page for Stack Exchange with no user-specific content. Further, under a brand new OS-user-account (freshly created for this test) two browsers (Safari and Firefox) also gave the same result.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome - and head scratchingly odd. Thanks for the above and beyond testing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The `m.google.com` and `mobilex` bits of your URL might indicate that Google is trying to serve you some kind of mobile adaptation.

When I am signed in to Google (with the UA set to be like an iPhone), I do get a mobilified G+ Stack Exchange page. I guess G+ is not quite mobile-ready (or they just do not want to render otherwise public pages for visitors that are not signed into Google).


















I've noticed that people post bit.ly links quite often. I don't notice it as often here as the other SE sites, but it's still a problem, in my opinion. There is no reason to post a bit.ly link at all. Should we be discouraging these links?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we discourage shortened links (bit.ly, etc.)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you objecting to bit.ly in particular or URL shorteners in general?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel URL shorteners in general.


















I agree, bit.ly links in questions and answers are pointless and are somewhat harmful - you can't see where the link goes without clicking on it, and it both relies on and provides information to a third-party service. I suggest that all URL shortened links in questions and answers be rewritten with the full URL.

As for comments, there is a character limit, so a shortened URL might be used to stay within the number of allowed characters. This is the only case where bit.ly or other shortened URLs should be acceptable.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you can see the location of the links by hovering over them and looking at the bottom of the browser. it will display the url of the page it points to. (depending on your browser.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Furthermore, it is another thing that over time can result in a link becoming dead. It's bad enough that 3 years from now, many of the links shall be gone, but shorteners are not indexed at archive.org or elsewhere and make a link that much more fragile and prone to breaking. Add in the slowness of current users needing to ask bit.ly where to direct the link - it's obscuring the referrals from here and slowing things down. Not a lot of win in keeping them around anywhere is how I see this.

For one reason or another, we missed 2H 2011. Nevermind that, though, let us commence with 1H 2012! And yes, it starts in December.

What in the Wide, Wide World of Sports is Going On Here?

TL;DR -- put images and links in the answers. If they get voted up enough, they will appear on the main site as community promotion ads.

But whyyyyyyy?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


cool apple related open source apps
the site's twitter account
scripts packs or power tools
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. And to click on it for great justice!

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url

Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 220 x 250 pixels
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/932here.

Bad for everyone. Starting fresh lets us also clean the slate, as otherwise new ads wouldn't be able to stand against old ads that simply are standing around with high votes.

I flagged question https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27360/are-there-any-non-apple-multi-touch-trackpads-on-the-marketAre there any non-Apple multi-touch trackpads on the market? as "off-topic" and also commented that it probably should be migrated to Super User. The flag was declined with a reason that the question is on-topic.


  I love the Apple trackpad with its multi-touch gestures. I want to buy a MacBook Pro primarily because of this. I am a student though and it seems to be very expensive for me. 


In other words the OP likes a multi-touch trackpad, but would like to buy a PC because MacBook Pro is too expensive for his/her budget.


  Hence I was wondering if any other company except for Apple provides a trackpad, or is it only available on Apple devices?


I admit, this part of the question might make it on-topic: Are multi-touch trackpads (there is no mention the question is only about Magic Trackpad) only available for Apple devices?


  Also if this is the case then is there a software that can be used to mimic the Apple trackpad on an ordinary laptop? I am using Synaptic but is not the same.


Question is: how to get MacBook Pro's touchpad's functionalities on a PC-laptop's touchpad.

And finally, confirming the OP is looking for a solution for Windows:


  i want a hardware and software package. Are there any drivers in windows that will understand the trackpad movements?


All in all, the questions are:


Is Apple the sole provider of multi-touch trackpads (on-topic)


If this is true, then how to have the multi-touch functions on a PC laptop's bundled trackpad? (off-topic)
If this is false, then which PC-companies have laptops that have multi-touch features (off-topic)



Hidden (not asked, but could be involved in answers) workaround questions:


Are there external multi-touch trackpads for PC laptop? (off-topic)
Can I use the Magic Trackpad on a PC laptop? (on-topic)




My question is: should the question be heavily edited or migrated to Super User? Or am I wrong enough to just let the question be?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions on Apple-like hardware for PCs on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I had the same reservation when I read that question. I'm still "new" (as in actively participating here) but my take is how does an answer to this question help future readers? And specific to this question, even if an answer is viable (non-Apple sourced multi-touch hardware), will it work with Apple without device driver support?


















You're right, that is off topic, sorry. When I read it for some reason I thought the asker was looking for a non-Apple multitouch trackpad to use with a Mac (which would be on topic), but in rereading the question that's clearly not the case.

Thanks for bringing this back up. I wish I could undo the flag decline, but from what I can tell those are permanent once cast.

Meta is synced with the main site every hour, and cannot be edited from meta itself. The copy profile will update your primary site profile, and then this will be synced with Meta at the next sync.

The only exception is Meta.SO which is not linked to SO in the same way. Currently both your profiles are showing the same information.

Tag icons are sponsored. Companies purchase the right to put their icon on a tag for a period of time. As far as I am aware this is currently only done on StackOverflow, and not on the rest of the network.

I have seen a few new users who have had an issue and used this site to get their answer, after they have the answer they are not seen again, and leave the questions without accepted answers.

Could we implement a system where moderators can accept the answer with the most up votes after a month, or failing that as the majority are not always correct, could we force accept an answer when the OP posts a comment saying that the answer was correct but has not accepted it.

This kind of feature request is more suited for http://meta.stackoverflow.comMeta Stack Overflow.

However, all those request have been /questions/tagged/status-declinedstatus-declined, since the community already accept an answer by upvoting it. See https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/50453/12008here.

I guess you are right with the community vote, but in this case linked to above you will see that the OP has said that my answer was the solution but will not accept.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, in some cases it's more frustrating. But the real problem here is drawing a line. If you start to manually accept answers for the OP, then people are going to start complaining when the mods don't accept answer for *their* question. It's much much easier to deal with the situation like it is now, with a single rule for everybody.


















It's the quality of the post; the number of users who already reviewed it is not shown.

The quality number can be a negative or a positive number; the highest number I have seen is 79 (in the "low quality posts" tab for the review page), and the lowest is −7. As negative numbers are used, I think that the higher the number is, the higher is the post's quality.

How did you figure that out?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How is the quality number calculated? Why isn't voting up/down enough?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@daviesgeek I keep reading on Meta Stack Overflow. `:-)`b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt As a matter of fact, there are some answers that are marked as low quality, and that are perfectly fine for the question being asked; they are one-line answers, but their presence could mean the question is not acceptable. Suppose somebody replies with "Yes." It could be the answer should be expanded, or it could be that is the only answer possible for the question; in the latter case, it is probable the question should be closed. As far as I know, how the quality is calculated is not known. Maybe there are posts/comments about that, but not detailed.


















I looked at https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/13/should-the-beta-badges-stop-being-awarded-to-usersSO meta, and they have removed the badge for participating in the beta.

I think that all the badges should be attainable for everyone, so badges like Beta and precognative. 

I do understand that these are a medal and people are proud to ahve them but can these be incorporated into the profile rather than a badge, as no newer users will ever have the chance of gaining these badges.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should all badges be attainable?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oooh, if we down vote the question and up vote the answer enough, will we get a "Reversal" here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm all for it :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel Sounds like a good idea to me!


















There are a number of badges which are practically unattainable for various reasons:


"participated in Beta" -> obvious
"Legendary" (Earned 200 daily reputation 150 times) -> maybe in a few years
"Reversal" (Provided answer of +20 score to a question of -5 score) -> how likely is that?


So I think one unattainable badge more or less doesn't matter.

Moderators don't generally delete things because they are incorrect or out of date. This is one of the stock flag rejection messages: "Flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies, or an altogether wrong answer".

It's okay to edit, but you generally shouldn't change the meaning of the original post. This is one of the stock edit rejection messages: "This edit changes too much in the original post; the original meaning or intent of the post would be lost."
Note, of course, that if the post is a Community Wiki you should by all means change it as much as necessary.

Generally, the thing to do is write your own answer!
If your new one is correct, people will vote it up and it will float to the top.

It's also completely okay to comment on an out-of-date answer to warn the OP and other users.

I would probably stop short of downvoting until the OP has had fair warning that their post is out of date, so that they have a chance to fix it.

Since SuperUser is right now the more populous and active site (150k visits daily to our 30k visits), I'd recommend....


Ask at SuperUser when it's the kind of question that would benefit from being seen/answered by a lot of people, and is not a question that requires much Apple-specific expertise.
Ask at SuperUser when it involves using Windows or Linux with something Apple, in particular if the "expert" part of the question needs a Windows or Linux expert more than it needs an Apple one.
Ask at AskDifferent when you need more technical Apple expertise, when your question would be answered by a "right" answer as opposed to a crowd-sourced list, or when your question is  so keenly focused on Apple hardware/software/OS that this is the best place to get a good answer.


In short...


  Ask where you think you're most likely to get a good answer.

This week, we’re kicking off a “Hot Topic of the Week” series.

How it works: One topic is designated each week, and each person who asks a question relating to that topic will be eligible to win a prize. Topics are chosen from your suggestions in the community wiki below.

How to enter: Ask a question relating to the topic of the week, and tag it accordingly (this week, use the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-4siphone-4s tag). Each question you ask will get you one entry into a random drawing to win an iPhone accessory(s) of your choice ($100 max).

This round will begin today (Dec. 23) and end on Monday (Jan. 2).

Update: Congratulations to https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/15559/allen-chaoAllen Chao for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34708/is-my-iphone-model-number-mc922ll-a-unlocked-or-lockedwinning this week! Thank you everyone who participated. The weekly hot topic challenge is on hold for the next week. 
Please continue to add suggestions for upcoming weeks below!

This sounds like a great idea!

The model would fit perfectly for our site, especially given the wealth of apps and accessories that would make perfect prizes.

I saw what happened on Andorid and was secretly hoping that you guys would offer to do something similar with us :)

I'm posting a separate CW answer for topic ideas.

Wasn't sure about  those I left open, hopefully someone will tag them too. I think it's good to add tags for the topics already while suggesting: if the hot week topic can't be properly tagged, how could it be a good topic anyway? (And of course it is more practical for the contest manager to have the tags in advance.)


















I know that people using Lion will have nice, pretty scrollbars, but what about those of us who don't have Lion? I was wondering if we can add some iOS-like scrollbars to the site. I think that it would add more personality to the site.
Example http://css-tricks.com/examples/WebKitScrollbars/here:



Obviously we'd have to make the scrollbars grey...but that's simple.

EDIT: Here's the code:

/* For the "inset" look only */
html {
    overflow: auto;
}
body {
    position: absolute;
    top: 1px;
    bottom: 1px;
    overflow-y: scroll;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
/* Start Scrollbar */
::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 10px;
} 
/* Track */
::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
    -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
/* Handle */
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 0 45px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:window-inactive {
    background: rgba(255,0,0,0.4);
}
/* End Scrollbar */


Which gives you this:


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we add iOS-like scrollbars to this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lion scrollbars are ugly; please don't inflict them on people who have chosen not to subject themselves to Lion's aesthetic.


















I copied the code from above into a user stylesheet on http://userstyles.org/userstyles.org.

If you want to try the scrollbars out, you can install https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffeStylish for Chrome or https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshomefor Firefox.
Go to http://userstyles.org/styles/58387/ask-different-lion-scrollbarsthe stylesheet and click Install.



Here's my personal opinion:
While I don't think that Lion's scrollbars are ugly, I do think that people should be able to use whatever scrollbars they like, be that their OS's scrollbars, their browser's scrollbars, or a custom stylesheet. Generally, sites that override that without a very good reason end up just being annoying

You have got the ‘clicked tab’ metaphor in reverse:

To me, it looks like all the other tabs are clicked. Or maybe it’s the Apple® way.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Clicked tab is backwardsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In what browser was that screenshot taken? There's no outline or shadow; just a gradient, and the corners aren't rounded.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That looks like IE8- to me. I'd say it's okay to look like that in a 3-year-old browser, but that's Jin's (the designer's) call. Anyway, is your condescending tone really necessary?


















I suspect StackExchange as an entity wants to avoid being sued or criminally prosecuted, and this shapes some of the constraints on the site (e.g. the ban on discussing software covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement). And in the case of the NDA, the discussion itself is the illegal activity. Since the SE corporation owns the servers, of course we need to play by whatever rules they impose for their own protection. That said, if whatever legal minds at SE don't prohibit a discussion and it's about


Apple hardware
Apple software
other Apple products or services
third-party hardware and software for Apple products


and not about


Apple Developer Programs or iTunes Connect (including iAd)
programming, with the exception of AppleScript and Automator
installing or using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware
a shopping or buying recommendation for hardware
pre-release or beta software
obtaining or using pirated software or media


then I don't see why the legality of the discussed activity is an issue. Laws are different all over the world, and legality changes. We discuss what is technically possible. For what it's worth, asking how to use the Facebook app is likely illegal in countries where Facebook is banned. Asking how to send an encrypted message is illegal in some parts of the world. Asking how to read certain authors' books in iBooks is illegal in some parts of the world. But certainly we don't want to ban these topics from the site, or at least not because they are illegal in some places. Asking how to read a particular author or work is a not terribly interesting question from a technical perspective.

My understanding is that we don't discuss obtaining or using pirated software not because it's illegal, but because that isn't the site this community wanted to be. There are other fora where such things are discussed, but that isn't what we are. If someone wanted to know which software was best for creating fake ID cards on a Mac, that wouldn't be a very technically interesting question, but I don't believe it would be off-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Correct, your last paragraph was what I was attempting to get at with my last paragraph. Though the downsides to IMEI changing are more subtle, the fact that it has practically no legitimate upside inclines me to close the question in this instance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. People thinking SE should nix Qs that might be associated with activity illegal somewhere should consider that in some countries simply accessing a website is illegal. If the PLA decided SE was dangerous and blocked it, would we feel compelled to either shut down or block all Chinese IPs? Of course not. It's an extreme, but extremes are instructive.

SE's concern with the law should be limited to self-preservation, which means only the tiny part of US law that can be construed to affect online information sharing.

SE cannot afford to start trying to interpret all countries' laws.


















To me, this big issue here is section 1(1)c and 1(1)d:


  A person commits an offence if:
   - he offers or agrees to change, or interfere with the operation of, a    unique device identifier, or
   - he offers or agrees to arrange for another person to change, or    interfere with the operation of, a unique device identifier.


That means that if someone helps someone change the IMEI, or helps someone help someone change the IMEI, they've violated the UK law.

To me, this seems significant because a user in the UK could answer this question without knowing that he's in violation of the law.
IMO, we owe our users a little bit of protection from inadvertent things like that.



It seems like, in the question you linked to, the problem is with the SIM card and unlocking the phone, and an IMEI change isn't necessarily necessary.

In the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15881/how-can-i-change-my-iphone-4s-imei-numberother question, it seems that the solution isn't to change the IMEI yourself but rather to resolve the standing issues between the user, Apple, and the carrier.

As far as I can tell, there is no legitimate reason that a user would need to change the IMEI.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.



So, here are my proposed solutions:

If a question has no legitimate value (i.e. there's no reason to do the illegal thing except for the exact reason that the law forbids it),
and it's possible that someone could get in trouble just for answering the question...
Delete the question. There's no reason to keep it, and it's potentially dangerous.

If a question has some legitimate value (i.e there's a good reason do do the illegal thing),
and it's possible that someone could get in trouble just for answering the question...
Add a note to the question warning readers that it's potentially illegal.

If it isn't possible that someone could get in trouble just for answering the question...
Leave the question. At some point, as long as they aren't endangering someone else, users can be responsible for themselves.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aside from quibbling about what makes a reason "legitimate" (or whether we have any reason to make that judgement), I agree wholeheartedly with your reasoning here, Nathan.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel That is a very good point about judging legitimacy. IMO, this kind of thing comes up infrequently enough that we can handle it. If it does become a problem, though, we can always decide to just provide the warning note if there's any question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you make some very good points here, mainly the idea of protecting out users. However, for the most part we have to, out of necessity, trust that the people participating in the site have knowledge of and/or take responsibility for their actions on the site as they pertain to their local laws. But like you said, in cases where there isn't legitimate value, it can only help to close/delete the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looking at the amount of people using other forums to change IMEI numbers I do not thik many people are aware of its law.

The main reason to change an IMEI number is beacuse a phone has been stolen, reported, and blocked. The phone can only be unblocked by the carrier, not even Apple. I think we should stay clear of this activity beacuse it is illegal in some countries. Re wording the question is fine, but my issue here is that if some one has stolen the phone, or bought a stolen one, they are goiing to word their question in a way which suggests it is theirs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Graeme You're right, which is why I suggested that we simply delete questions that have no legitimate value.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NathanGreenstein, no UK user who answered the question "how does one change an IMEI?" would be in violation of the sections you quoted, unless their answer was "by paying me [or my buddy] 50 pounds." The error was introduced in your summarizing the sections. To "help" by providing information or even encouragement is *not* "to offer or agree to [change or block an IMEI]" or "to offer or agree to arrange for someone [to do so]". If those sections are representative, that statute seems deliberately worded not to regulate speech (e.g. sharing of information), but only actions. Clear on 2nd read?


















January 28th, 2012 will mark  Ask Different's 1-year anniversary of graduation!

Stack Exchange has offered to support a special Ask Different event in honor of that anniversary.

I've added an answer with my ideas, but exactly what we do is up to the community. If you've got an idea for how to party it up come the 28th, please share!

Be sure to vote on the ideas you like!
There's no reason to limit ourselves to only one option; comment on an answer if you think it can be expanded, built off of, or combined with another answer.

Lots of marathons and lots of prizes.
We've already been http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2014/ask-different-answerthon-planningkicking around the idea of an answerthon, à la https://travel.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/360/halloween-answer-a-thonTravel.stackexchange.com. The idea to integrate a push for voting and flagging, possibly before the Answerthon, has also http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/2865753#2865753come up.

I like both of these ideas, and think that they would work very well on Ask Different. We've got a relatively low http://stackexchange.com/sites?sort=percentanswered&expand=truePercent Answered rate (8th from the bottom, at the time of this writing), and we also have less voting than many other sites. I think that a big push would not only help us with the backlog of questions we already have, but also help get a 'lots of voting' vibe in the air which would hopefully stick with people as they continue to use the site.

Answering and voting are both very important, but there's more to a successful, happy Q&A site than that. For http://blog.superuser.com/2011/08/19/super-users-2nd-birthday-super-contest/Super User's 2nd birthday, they encouraged people to edit posts, edit tag wikis, and write for the blog (in addition to the things mentioned above). Why restrict people to votes, flags, and answers; I'd love to encourage people to do the smaller things that make this site great.

Oh, and Super User did more than encourage people to help the site: they rewarded them.
Prizes included swag and hardware/software.
Stack Exchange has offered to support something similar for us, if people are interested.
To see the exact categories of involvement and their rewards, take a look at the http://blog.superuser.com/2011/08/19/super-users-2nd-birthday-super-contest/SU blog post. I really like their categories and think they would integrate very well with the marathons we've been thinking about.  

If you've got ideas for categories and prizes, comment here!
We'll also need a panel of judges. If you're interested, comment here.

I just wanted to go to the blog in order to leave a comment. 

However, it really took me a while just to get there! I simply could not find a link.

How come the blog is so hardly accessible? What can we do about this?

I vote for creating a placeholder at the top - next to review, chat, meta, about and faq.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we make the AskDifferent blog more easily accessible?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For some reason, I could not add the tag 'blog'. So I had to use 'discussion' instead because I could not post without a tag. I was also asked several times to verify that I'm a human being when trying to post this?! Lol.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 agree with it being alongside, review, meta, etc, etc


















I will note that in the current implementation, a 'blog' link is added to the header navigation with a 'NEW' stamp next to it for 24 hours following a new post on the Ask Different blog. But after that 24 hours? Poof. Back to only the footer.

Note: Per Rebecca Chernoff's comment, blog links on the main site go to the http://apple.blogoverflow.comAsk Different blog where blog links on the meta site go to the http://blog.stackexchange.com/Stack Exchange blog.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I thought that I've seen a placeholder before. Then I assumed it was a false memory. In your last sentence you indirectly mention that there is a permanent placeholder for the main Stack Exchange blog?! I don't see one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You pointed it out in your question :). Above the list of graduated sites in the footer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't see you wrote footer.... Still, I'm confused: There are two blogs? I only find [this](http://apple.blogoverflow.com/) one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your link goes to the Ask Different Blog on BlogOverflow. The footer blog link always goes to the Stack Exchange blog. I'll note that the header blog link switches between AD and SE, whichever one was posted in most recently, I think. As an aside, the podcast link always goes to the Stack Exchange podcast, there is no link love in the site's navigation for the Ask Different Podcast.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This isn't entirely correct.  Both links on the main site (the header and the footer) go to the community-specific blog.  Both links on the meta site go to the SE blog.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well that's confusing. And did it change at any point? I could swear at one point after apple.blogoverflow existed that I've gone to blog.se from the Main site, but indeed there in no 'NEW' tag nor even a blog link in the header at the moment despite a new blog.se post.


















I noticed that there a lot of questions that are flagged as community wiki, even if there is not that much answers or are quite new. For instance there are 10 questions on the homepage currently. Is there a new policy about this flag? Because I though it was a flag to avoid huge reputation gain on one post.

  So my question is : What kind of procedure do you use to keep a safe copy of your stuff?


This turns it into a polling question - a question where there isn't a single, correct answer but a case where you solicit different answers from different people. The reason why such questions are converted to Community Wiki is twofold:


It acts as a signal to indicate the kind of question it is.
When people vote on the answers to such a question, they're mostly voting on whether or not they, too, agree with or do what the answer says, instead of judging it in comparison to the other answers on technical merit, correctness, and completeness.

Too many CW posts are frowned upon, but this question generated a polling response that was actually quite informative (more than most, I'd argue), while at the same time not one that was likely to be the "correct answer." Thus, CW


















From a Super User point of view: You can ask any question about computer hardware and software. This includes questions about your Mac, about Mac OS X, about Apple software, about software for Mac OS X, etc. Several users on SU are active in the related topics, so it's not like there's nobody to answer these questions.

Electronic devices are considered off topic, which includes all iOS devices and iPods, unless it's a home networking question or about interfacing with your computer. This means that, for example, Time Capsule and AirPort Express/Extreme are on topic, and questions about syncing your iPhone with your Mac, or backing up iOS data to your computer are fine. The line might be a bit blurry there, but the worst thing that can happen is that the question will be migrated here.

Another possible issue, and I have no idea how it's handled on Ask Different: Super User moderators don't really like software recommendation questions. If you just want to know what Twitter clients are available on OS X, and it's obvious you have not even bothered to use Google, the question will be closed quickly. My advice is to not ask "What software can do X", but instead ask "I have problem Y. How do I solve it on a Mac?"



Some people say that there are some topics where SU is better suited, and others where Ask Different is better suited, even though they are on topic on both sides. While this might be the case, you can freely choose which site you want to post on.

If a question doesn't get an answer on your chosen site for a few days, you can always request that a moderator moves it to another site. From my experience, these requests are always acted on quickly.

Generally, software recommendation questions need to demand a clear, specific featureset. You can't ask 'What are all the...' or 'What is the best...'


















Yes, https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#signaturessignatures are discouraged and it's completely okay to remove them.

Your edits will be accepted if you remove signatures.
However, when you can, try to find some other things that you can edit to improve the question so it isn't bumped to the top of the Active Questions page just for having the signature removed :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5early on one of my first questiosn had the thanks removed, and a suggestion that an upvote is the accepted way of showing thanks.  The problem is that upvotes remain anonymous to most users, and the removal of please/thankyou from questions and comments etc also removes the human element, making a question look more like a demand for an answer.  Personally I like to see some personality in the posts, as if nothing else it helps to make for a friendly face that ensure the site is welcoming and thus more likely to receive repeat visits.


















I don't think it's a good idea to delete those questions. In fact, THIS site is the last one of the SE constellation that still have (and allow) those kind of "List-Question". (Surely one of the reasons why there is the word "different" in his name :-) ) I've tried to argue on different meta about the unafordable great source of information that those questions represent, but I've faced such a religious-minded counter-strike that I was left voiceless. They must be some "Jeff'Fan Boys" talking about the rules of SE as the Rules of Moise.  

I (totally?) agree that the current format of SE Q&A site doesn't fit super nicely, but that's only a technical problem. The content is nice and can not be found elsewhere on the internet.

So for the sake of having good examples of those kind of questions, and the argument of their value just by looking at the number page views (that has certainly attracted tons of new users to the constellation!), I really want those questions to be left on this web site.

In fact, I'm pretty sure that the SE engine will be able soon (or later) to handle those kind of "question without 1 good answer only". Those questions would then migrate to that more suitable look&Feel.

For instance, I'm so sad that a question about "false friend/faux amis" has been deleted from the French SE! There was a superb collection of the "Actually/Actuellement". So sad that this unique source of information has disappeared, just because someone said that "technically" those kind of question are not allloooooooowed.

If Joel & Jeff reaalllly wants to provide better content for the masses on the internet, then they will address this stupid (but yet complex) "format" issue. Do you think PHPBB is better at Collection Type Q&A ? :-P

I hope I'll be read by the Dev team of SE too. Thanks.

Actual problems being faced make the best questions and are why the network was designed as it is today. The "Top Tips" for Terminal could be an AD blog post linking to individual questions with answers. Less clutter on the site and the "list" is preserved for the pack rats. Success!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wow - that is a great suggestion. I think the site has the ability to let people propose blog entries and have them reviewed (so it can be quite open to anyone who wishes to author one of these topics). Would you perhaps answer this with a version of your comment and we can think through how this might work / refine the suggestion.


















I'd like to see a Birthday Answerathon that looks something like this:
Step 1: The search
We put a link to search parameters for unanswered question over a certain age, and encourage site users to vote the questions up if think we should focus on finding answers for them, or flag/close them if they appear unanswerable with the information currently contained in the post.
As a result of this, we get a list of the top n questions needing answers.
Step 2: The Community Bounty
We get a bunch of community members to commit to reading any answers posted for these questions, and voting in favor of them if they look promising. Not an actual bounty, but it encourages people to work on answering the pending unanswered-but-answerable questions.
Step 3: The Answerathon itself
Ready... set... answer questions
Step 4: Prizes, Congratulations, and a much better answered question rate
Give out lots of birthday swag (if possible) or just online kudos for participants in the process -- most upvoted answers, best quality comments, most votes cast(!!!), etc.

To celebrate our birthday, we should elect more moderators to increase the number of active mods on the site.

The active tab is raised, rather than lowered. If "clicked tab" is the desired metaphor, I agree that it is backward. I suggest, however, that it isn't an incorrect implementation of the "clicked tab" metaphor, but rather a correct implementation of a different metaphor: the sliding switch. The sliding switch is over "active" rather than over one of the others, in the example I pasted above.

All that said, it looks much better in a standards-compliant browser than it does in IE. 

For whatever it's worth, in Safari, the active tab appears raised, not lowered, just like this interface does:


so this website about Apple products has an interface that follows the same conventions as the UI for the default Apple browser. So yes, all condescension aside, perhaps it is the Apple Way™.

So users with 10K reputation get access to moderator tools. And now 5K reputation gives you access to the queue of suggested edits to review. And absolutely, high reputation users give so much to this site, and it is wonderful they get access to tools to keep it in order. The decision to spread out some of these tools over a variety of reputation levels is also quite helpful.

But...

Reputation is gained for contributing to the content of the site, but other housekeeping tasks like flagging problematic posts or editing questions or answers to improve them do not directly link to reputation, but do improve the site. While some users point out that they see who makes good comments or edits and then go and upvote an answer of theirs, flags are (and should be) mostly hidden from view.

I'm suggesting that just like various reputation levels unlock certain tools to help users better maintain the site, it would be cool if various flag weights also unlocked moderation tools. It seems like a natural fit: people who spend the time and show good judgment in flagging problematic posts are ones who would be logical candidates to give more tools to in order to keep the site in order.

I don't have any specific suggestions as to what tools would be appropriate, and I suspect this one would need to migrate up the chain from meta.apple.stackechange.com to our corporate overlords in order to be implemented, but I wanted to get people's feedback here.

What say you all?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Access to some moderator tools should be linked to flag weight or editsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, since flag weight no longer exists, I suppose this is a moot point...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I fully support this idea, as even though flag weight is gone, there are many other ways of determining a user's moderating ‘ability’, such as percentage of accepted flags, number of helpful flags, reviews (although this could be gamed without audits), etc. There are both users with low reputation who are very capable at moderating, and vice versa. This was also [mentioned on Meta.SE](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252690/what-privilege-should-30k-users-get/252703#comment825187_252703) recently.

Something like your commment would be enough.


















Indeed there is plural protection, which wasn't wanted in this case. Looks like a mod created the tag in the meantime.

I think that some hardware recommendations can be on-topic, but that we should be careful to avoid becoming a site for hardware reviews.

Like with apps, hardware recommendations should have specific requirements. We don't want questions that are just 'List of all printers'; they get dated fast and are hard to actually pull specific info from, IMO. The more a question gets at a why something is useful, the more likely it will be of long term value to the site.

Hardware recommendations should also be relevant to the scope of the site and other users. Questions that are too localized should still be closed, and questions that barely relate to Apple should be closed. I would say that questions about adapters (like the one you linked to) are okay, but questions about something that doesn't relate to using Apple hardware/software (think laptop backpacks) shouldn't be allowed. It just doesn't seem to fit in with the site.

As you say, we don't want to just link to sales sites. I also don't think we want to become a review site, though. We're in the business of answering questions, not evaluating products.
The result of that is that we may have to be somewhat strict about making sure that people link to the manufacturer's site, and that people's commentary stays objective and factual.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would rather we focus on bad questions and good questions more than the subject of the question. The guidelines for practical, answerable, objective and descriptive go a long way to making it clear that the hardware recommendation is often tangentially related to why a question is closed for re-work or deletion. I'd rather have 10 questions get asked and seen and deal with fixing the one that needs help or sprouts some sort of subjective disagreement (canon vs HP vs Epson) rather than just rule out a class because of the poorest examples in the genre.


















You have hit the daily reputation cap on that day. From the https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#reputationFAQ:


  You can earn a maximum of 200 reputation per day. Please note that votes for posts marked “community wiki” do not generate any reputation, while accepted answers and bounty awards are not subject to the daily reputation limit.

If I can earn a maximum of 200 reputation per day, how come I've crossed that maximum already several times before?

While not ultra-elegant, I've found myself referring to these programs as Music.app, Video.app and, to extend the system, Mail.app to distinguish the application from the overall concept.

I am suggesting this "without ego" because I agree (in advance) with those who find the solution ugly and cumbersome. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Music.app` and `Videos.app` are certainly the most common names given when not just generally calling them "the Music app" or "the Music player". Akin to, as you said, `Mail.app`, `Settings.app`, etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We already have a `mail.app` tag, so I think this is probably the way to go.


















I have noticed that the majority of large community wiki questions have rules for posting. However, they aren't standard rules. Can we establish some official rules for community wiki questions?

My set of rules would be something like this:


Check to see if there are duplicates in this post by typing in the search box: inquestion:this searchTerm
Include only one <fill in the blank> in each anwer.
Include a description of the <fill in the blank>, its pros/cons, and why you use it.


For apps, etc., I would also add these rules:


Link to the developer's website, rather than a direct download page.
Cite the application name like such: #appName by [developer]
Please do not give a price because that can localize your answer too much.


Another thing I would add is that unless your community wiki is a really helpful list, it will be closed. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we establish official rules for community wiki questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you downvote ***PLEASE*** leave a comment!!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't down vote it, but I think it's a really bad idea. The fact that these sorts of questions need all manner of remedial and supplemental instructions shows how out of place they are with the "stack exchange" idea of what makes a good question. Yes we tolerate and enjoy the best of the best - but automating them seems like a step in the wrong direction to me.


















Those kind of questions are "frowned upon" in most of the sites (read: banned completely).

Here, some are still tolerated but more and more user are trying to get rid of them (and I'm one of them).

Those kind of question, can of course be nice to have. But on the whole, they're more work than they're worth. With people not respecting the rules (even when told explicitly on the first post). And they're more likely to get obsolete, since they're very vague to begin with.

So that's why I don't think it's worth having official rule, since they're not here to stay.

I personally think that the [Tips and Tricks](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5435/got-any-tips-or-tricks-for-terminal-in-mac-os-x) and [Tiny](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17759/what-tiny-thing-in-lion-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard) [Things](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27761/what-tiny-thing-in-ios-5-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard) are good CW questions. And any other similar questions. I know that the mods are also somewhat lenient with what CW questions they allow.


















The fix will be in the next production build.

Another approach would be to leverage the existing hyphen methodology:

music-app

video-app

mail-app 

The last would presumably be further refined through the use of additional operating system tags. 

This approach is somehow less "ugly" to my eye.  It doesn't modify the names of the applications as we normally see them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You actually answered the question about tagging itself! Well said. I agree that I think that style makes sense for a few different reasons.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I foresee a little confusion with mail.app, unless the correct 10.7 or iOS-5 etc tag is used in conjunction, it may not be totally clear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hence my comment about using a second tag to clarify. This would be a problem for either of these tag styles. The bigger issue that I see is that  multiple OS tags and a "specific search" may cause answers to general questions about mail.app (for either device family) to be missed. It's an imperfect world.


















The 2012 Community Moderator Election is now underway!

Community moderator elections have three phases:


Nomination phase
Primary phase
Election phase


Most elections take between two and three weeks, but this depends on how many candidates there are.

Please visit the official election page at

https://apple.stackexchange.com/electionhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/election

for more detail, and to participate!

If you have general questions about the election process, or questions for moderator candidates, feel free to ask them here on meta -- just make sure your questions are tagged /questions/tagged/electionelection.

A part of this is fixed, the rest will be after the next build of the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In light of [this request](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/1501/5472) - should this question still be marked status-completed?


















I personally don't see the use for most of these questions.  I see them as merely a way of showing our favourite tricks and tips which are in the end more of an ego stroke than there for the express purpose of assisting users with problems.  This is a Q&A site, not a discussion forum, and as such the only people who gain any benefit from them are regular users who are here to (if only as a side effect) expand upon their own knowledge for no other reason than curiosity.

I can't see a scenario where a user will stumble upon one of these answers as a way of answering a problem that they have come to the site to ask.

I think if anything, the setting of one of these questions should be strictly limited to ensure it's set correctly, and isn;t subsequently closed after a few answers as it was never a good choice.  A good example was the "what would make Safari perfect" thread, which was a) framed badly (It should have been titled something like "What needs improving/adding to Safari to make it better"), and b) closed before it got a head of steam up as being of low quality.  Perhaps a moderator would have to approve such questions in the future, and have them on a set schedule, one a week starting each Monday for example?  This way we could agree on a schedule of future questions to ensure that the most popular ones are agreed before appearing on the site, and we can plan to introcude a core of knowledge tat isn't Q&A rather than let it just appears without due consideration of the aims of the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51. The 'perfect Safari' question was just bad for numerous reasons, I would go as far as to say that there was nothing to save it considering the subject matter. 2. SE does not have a scheduling function, and rolling them out in such a manner is not any more productive. 3. Once a week? That rate is significantly higher than CWs are even created *now*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Automated scheduling would be a problem, but the moderator group could probably take suggestions from the community and discuss them in Chat to make an informal list, and manually dole out to one poor sucker (I mean volunteer) to put one out at a time, maybe on the schedule of always having one active, so when one dries up start the next, on the basis that they should all be of consistent format with vetted aims?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with that idea entirely.


















I noticed today that even a tiny edit like simply removing the word "thanks" form the end of a question can bump it right back to the top of the list of questions.

Whilst this does alert interested users of change, it also bumps the rest of the questions down the way.  When you get a serial editor come along and make dozen of changes on a short period of time, the entire first page of results can be shunted away making space for edits that may not have materially amended the post.  It does seem odd to see a whole load of older posts jump to the front leaving the newer questions way down the page where they are less likely to be spotted.

Would it not be better for edits to be construed as responses to those that have already taken part in the question, without it making them look like new content in the form of an answer?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should making edits bump a question to the top of the list?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26483/could-we-have-the-ability-to-mark-a-change-as-minor-in-questions-or-answersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Exactly that - great link, and as one of the commenters mentioned over there, it's much worse on lower traffic sites like this one when it happens, as there isn't the natural flow of normal content being thrown into the mix at the same speed as the edits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the absence of such a mechanism, perhaps we need to discourage serial editing sprees.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Honest question: did I "inspire you" (cause you) to post this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hehe, honest Answer: No, actually it was "daviesgeek", and while it's not a criticism of his efforts, clearly every edit improves something, he was knocking them out at a rate a couple a minute.  The comment over on the main SE site restricted himself to one an hour to prevent the massive exodus of posts with the same name to the top of the list.  That seems a little low.  I think a better option is to better encourage the behaviour of avoiding tiny edits, like simply removing "thanks" that might clean things up but don't add to the question or answers validity, unless further edits are madeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was actually wondering about the same thing myself. Particularly because I mainly make cleanup edits that aren't major edits. I don't like cluttering up the main page of the site with old posts. However, I usually try not to edit at a high traffic time, so night time, etc. Thanks for posting, BTW.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd answer "No". Many's the time I've seen some question from 5 years ago that's gone to the top of the list because someone's corrected a spelling mistake.


















The selected and unselected states of the vote-up and vote-down buttons here on Ask Different Meta aren't distinct enough for me to understand the difference. I'm including a screenshot that I just took:



This appeared next to a meta answer that I voted up, but it is hard for me to determine what black means and what gray means. I don't visit the meta side very often, so I'm likely to forget which is which.

Can the selected vote button have some more color (distinct from grayscale), either in the arrow segment, the outer circle, or both?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could the voted/unvoted button artwork be further differentiated on meta.apple?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed that the distinction is minimal.  I'd be more interested to know why you would want to see any further distinction tho.  It's only useful to see if you have voted - if you haven't, you still can, and if you have, and try to again, it will tell you, so the only scenario where you might need this information clearer is if you can't remember if you have voted or not, in which case just try voting and see what happens.  Having said that, a small green/red ring around rather than a slightly darker arrow might actually look nicer on pure aesthetics but I don't think it would add functionalityb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm, addition to the above, I only just realised it was different on the main site, with the arrow being slightly blue instead of a darker grey.  And as such, I'm with you purely on a point of consistency.  Make them the same, but while we are at it, why not try to use a bit of colour instead :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The meta sites are always supposed to be "mute". They are a greyscale / mute pallete of the main site. Go look at any site's main and meta, it follows this convention. I can't speak to any kind of visual impairment/accessibility if that is the argument here, but to me, the dark button (like a lit elevator call button), plus the 'depressed' vs. 'embossed' style makes it obvious to me which way I voted here on meta.


















Most posts on meta seem to invite answers, which is what the SE engine seems to be good at. But there are https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1002/the-ios-challenge-winnerssome posts that seem more like announcements and less like anything that can be answered. On the other hand, they are useful announcements. Is meta the right place for non-questions to be posted (as opposed to, say, the blog, or some other announcement forum)? Note that these sorts of posts are neither a bug report, feature request, call for  discussion, nor request for support.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have posts on meta that aren't questions that can be answered?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and yes, this post really belongs on meta.meta.apple.stackexchange.com...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Something like this may indeed fit better on the blog. There's a little bit of a grey area since site-specific blogs are still so new.


















This is a design choice we made deliberately. If you look at any site's meta (from http://meta.stackoverflow.comMeta Stack Overflow to http://meta.parenting.stackexchange.comMeta.Parenting to http://meta.scifi.stackexchange.comMeta.SciFi to this site's meta) the design choices are clear: take the main site design and strip out most (but not necessarily all) of the color, imbuing the site with the greyscale look you see before you. 

It's a deliberate design choice, one that we reflect across the network.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This explains *why* this problem exists, but that doesn't mean it can't be fixed. The bicycles meta site uses a different graphic for the header, surely a similar change could be made for the buttons here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I make no promises, @KyleCronin, but I'll ask. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Surely in any design functionality must take preference over consistency - here the consistent design just does not work as you cannot see the difference (yes my eyesight is not 20/20)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @KyleCronin: it's an explanation, but it doesn't address the flaw. A higher contrast would suffice. Lets you keep the greyscale but not hurt usability. Also: glad I'm not the only one who has a hard time telling them apart...


















If you post a question about a problem you have, then find the solution to your own problem, please, please post it.

While official policy is to http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/encourage self-answering questions, I personally take a dimmer view of people who post a question then answer their own question seconds later. If it's a common problem to which the user wants to document the solution, that can be a helpful contribution to the site, but frankly I hold such questions to a higher standard of "it better be a good general question."

In general, SE question serve two purposes: they help the OP get the information they need, and they create a searchable archive of useful information for people who encounter the problem in the future. If a question seems likely to only fill the first role, it gets closed as "too localized." But an instantly self-answered question only fills the second role, so it had better be good at that second role (i.e. it should be something that others are likely to look for).

If someone asks and then instantly answers their own question, my first response is to ask "what's the point?" Sometimes there is indeed a good point in documenting the question, but if there isn't, I'm likely to vote against the question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Right. Nathan, Jason, and I discussed this on the [Ask Different Best Practices podcast](http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/01/podcast-20-ask-different-best-practices/) (27:00 to 31:30). We came to the conclusion that a question should be a problem that you're having, and that although easy questions are OK, lazy questions are bad. If you can instantly answer your question, you didn't really have a legitimate problem.


















The bounty should not be a factor in providing a reasonable answer, and as per the Meta question just raised about answering your own questions, feel free to add your own and if you feel it is substantively better than those offered by other users, then also feel free to accept it.  It's not as though you are in some way gaming the system, you won't be any better off than if you never asked it.

Think of the three separate ideas:


You spent bounty to have the question featured - plain and simple. If, and, or when it gets answered is detached from the actual payment of bounty. You are paying to be featured and that is all.
You should always answer to your best ability if you have a good answer. That way people can edit, see, learn and perhaps come up with an even better answer once they see yours (especially if they didn't understand he question fully until they see your answer).
In the end - award the bounty as you see fit. That question will be marked as bounty and as long as someone else answered, they will get the credit as a thanks.

This is an extension of https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1028/should-making-edits-bump-a-question-to-the-top-of-the-listShould making edits bump a question to the top of the list?, which was asked yesterday. I have a tendency to edit a lot of question and answers, which bumps them to the top of the main page of Ask Different. Is it possible to add a "Minor edit" checkbox to the edit page, which will prevent it from floating to the top?

I realize that this may not be technically feasible, but if at all possible, I think this would be an extremely helpful feature.

I don't expect we're going to get this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I however, don't agree exactly with what they say. I see there point, but why not make it a feature that only user over, say 3K or 5K, can do? If someone is going to take the time to build up a 3K user, they more than likely won't spam the site. You could also have a peer review queue for the minor edits. Just my 2¢ worth...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not saying you should agree with them. I often don't. But ultimately, when it comes to feature requests, we're requesting and they're deciding, and it sounds like they've rather firmly made up their mind, so I'm just suggesting that this might not be a very fruitful request.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also note that this is really asking the same question as [Should making edits bump a question to the top of the list?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1028/should-making-edits-bump-a-question-to-the-top-of-the-list), but proposing a specific solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel Yes, that's what I said in my question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to say, having this and the '[source](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1042/should-we-be-changing-titles-from-how-to-to-how-can-i-do-i-should-i)' question both hovering around the top of meta really confused me, because the discussion overlaps quite a bit. Add to the fact that it exists elsewhere, primarily because it really is an engine question, not a site specific question, hence the link out to Meta Stack Overflow.


















In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Town Hall Chat session with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.  I am working with the candidates to find a time that allows the most participation.

The Town Hall Chat will take place Wednesday the 8th at 03:00 UTC. This is Tuesday at 10:00pm EST

http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=2&day=8&year=2012&hour=03&min=0&sec=0&p1=0view in other timezones

http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/322/ask-different-town-hall-chat?tab=scheduleregister here



Here are the details so far:


I would like to schedule this towards the beginning of the primary phase.  This means that I am looking at the 6th-8th. As soon as I coordinate with the existing moderators and candidates to find a best fit based on availability, I will edit this post with details on the "when".
The Town Hall Chat will be a one-hour event using our http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&sort=active&host=apple.stackexchange.comchat platform.  I will update this post with a direct link to the chat room once the event is scheduled.
The format will be an open discussion.  Users are encouraged to pose questions to the candidates regarding their thoughts on moderation.
After the chat session, a digest of the event will be permanently linked here.

Yes, meta is the right place for these types of questions, even if they aren't really "questions" per se.

Actually, you're asking in the right place about these things. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/cmon-get-meta/When Meta was first introduced it was meant to serve as a space for people to discuss the site without discussing the site on the site. (Still with me? Okay!) It was actually one of your mods, Kyle Cronin, who helped fight for and organize a MSO community before MSO was a thing.

Now, as we've grown and our network diversified, meta has become more than discussion-worthy queries -- it's also become a way to rally the community around events, cleanups, and contests. Meta has evolved just as our sites have evolved.

Think of it like this: not all discussions yield answers, and not all answers are responding to questions. Meta is a good place for those questions and answers. :D
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So to be absolutely clear and not confusing at all, we don't want to discuss the site on the site, but it's okay to discuss the meta-site on the meta-site? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hahaha, yes!

I think using a phpBB forum to discuss Stack Overflow was more than poor Jeff could bear :)


















I would like to call for discussion on the scope of this site in light of recent changes by Apple to broaden the audience for the iTunes Connect program.

I understand the initial hesitance to have Developer questions here on the end user forum - especially with Stack Overflow for hard developer questions and audience from coding to the app submission process. However, more and more end users are stepping forward to create iTunes connect accounts. 

I don't see any reason to expand the scope to include how to program at this point, but it seems overly restrictive to keep iTunes Connect in the "out of bounds" portion of scope for Apple products and services.

What started as a Service for developers to sell iOS apps has now has served up:


http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/02/28iTunes-U-Content-Tops-One-Billion-Downloads.htmlOne Billion iTunes U downloads
http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/02/06iTunes-Store-Sets-New-Record-with-25-Billion-Songs-Sold.html25 Billion iTunes songs sold
http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/01/07App-Store-Tops-40-Billion-Downloads-with-Almost-Half-in-2012.html40 Billion App store purchases with almost 20 Billion in 2012 alone


There will be questions about third party tools to manage billing, prepare songs and books for sale, and other topics related to selling or giving away content through the various Apple electronic storefronts. I think we can avoid any NDA issues by insisting that answers be sourced from public resources and be willing to clearly close or answer off-topic questions pointing the asker's to Apple's official channel for support in those cases.

I think the site was served well by initially discouraging iOS developers from asking iTunes connect questions, but now that we are excluding teachers, artists, musicians,  authors and programmers from asking iTunes Connect questions we're missing a large audience of people that use and work with one of Apple's most notable and unique services - their integrated store front for content creators.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we expand site scope to include iTunes Connect?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to feature this for a week and then see if any objections are aired by Wednesday the 10th of April and then suggest a FAQ change be made at that point to implement this in the absence of any widespread criticism of this proposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good; the proposal's been floating around for more than a year. It's time for some action.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have edited the FAQ section and would appreciate several eyes to look for typos and or omissions or inclusions that seem too broad or narrow. http://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/5788/revisions


















It's a good question even though I feel the answer should be no.

Unless someone has a really convincing argument why I'm wrong, I don't see this as something we would want to add. The site already has a timeout built in where repeated edits in a short period of time are considered one edit, so unless altering that interval is appropriate, the current bumping behavior is clearly intended.

Anything that encourages "minor" edits seems to go against the overall message that trivial edits are to be avoided. Wouldn't adding code handling to hide "minor" edits encourage behavior that is explicitly discouraged?

Wikipedia, for example, has no problems with minor edits.

I tend to be a conservative about these sorts of things, meaning that if this site is mostly working, the burden of proof lies with a proposal to change its scope. While some site clearly should include this as a topic, in my mind, the proposal needs to answer the question
Why here?
Questions about about selling apps, books, music, etc., through Apple's stores are clearly not questions about how to write computer programs.
But they also aren't exactly questions about using Apple products, which is the focus of this site. It seems to me that iTunes Connect questions would fit in better, perhaps, in a site where the audience is content developers of one sort or another rather than a site aimed at end users.
Is there a complementarity between questions about using Apple products and questions about selling content to users of Apple products? Yes, it's Apple-related, but do the questions attract answerers with the same expertise? I think that's the biggest relevant question. If having these questions hosted here would improve the base of answerers for the questions that are currently on-topic, it could be a good idea. If it's just more traffic on a sort-of-related-but-not-quite-overlapping subject, goodness knows it merits a place where it is on-topic, but I rather doubt that place is here.
If the askers are teachers, bands, and writers who want to list their content through iTunes, and want to know how to use Apple's iTunes Connect App, and they are looking for expertise from people familiar with using this app, I believe the answer is
Yes, these posts belong here.
I believe that the people who currently answer questions about using Apple apps and hardware can help answer questions about the Apple service known as iTunes connect, and that the questions are related enough and attract a similar enough species of end user that they will fit in nicely with this site.
I support this proposal.

We allow questions on iPhoto, iTunes, iPad/iPhone networking - do we shy away from setting up and using Apple accounts for buying Calendars and printed books from within iPhoto; shy away from all manner of iTunes account related issues, legalities, gotchas and billing within iTunes or the iTunes store web app called apple.com/support/itunes; or shy away from 3G data service questions as well as technical details relating to all three?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Your comment added to the original post about bands and teachers and authors as the desired audience of askers and people who can answer their technical questions as the answerers makes me feel like the answer to my question about "is there complementarity" is YES, and thus, I am inclined to SUPPORT this proposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awsome - the "why here" is simple. It's one of the many Apple products or services and many questions will also tie closely with knowledge or capabilities of Apple Software and Hardware. I'm of the opinion, "Why not here?" and can't see a good reason at this point why not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm a conservative in that regard: if something more or less works, the burden of proof is on any proposal to change it, rather than the other way around. But I think this proposal meets that burden of proof.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yippee - I appreciate the thoughts and the reasoning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The **[App Stores](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/30702/app-stores)** proposal is nearing critical mass; perhaps there within two months.


















This was a question that I brought up in the chat room yesterday. I brought the question over here to meta so that all the answers from all the people could be put into one place.  

The question is: Should we be changing titles from "How to...?" to "How can I/do I/should I....?"? I don't like "How to...?" because it is not a real question. When talking to someone, you wouldn't ask them "How to talk to Siri?", rather you'd ask "How do I talk to Siri?" Because I don't like "How to...?", I went on several editing sprees to correct mass numbers of questions with incorrect (according to me) titles. However, I will, in the future constrain myself to only editing questions in mass numbers every once in a while and not too often. Please post an answer. I value your thinking, even if I disagree with it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should I be changing titles from "How to...?" to "How can I/do I/should I....?"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please leave a comment if you downvote! Downvotes are ***useless*** without a comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On meta, it just means that someone disagrees. Consider it a 'no'.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nathan Yes, I know that, but it would be more helpful to leave comment/answer rather than just downvoting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems overly pedantic. While I agree that "the question" is key to the success of a SE site and that titles that are good questions are more likely to attract good answers, I don't think it is necessary for the title to "be" the question so long as its a clear representation of the content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would add that in cases of a "tie", that is to say when edits address preference, not correctness, the words of the original author should be given precedence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We need a meta meta site so the down-voting vs. commenting on yes/no questions issue can be properly addressed!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TimothyMueller-Harder, it [appears](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1030/should-we-have-posts-on-meta-that-arent-questions-that-can-be-answered#comment1876_1037) that meta *is* the meta meta site (and the meta meta meta site, ad infinitum).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel Haha, I'm glad that's been decided! :D


















If it's the only change, then I consider it trivial, and whilst it may irk you to be using a format that you consider less than perfect, or different to your preference, they you need to suffer in silence.

It's OK to say "Make some other change at the same time", but you need to ensure that the extra change (or changes) would also be valid and non trivial as a standalone edit.  2 trivial edits do not make a suitable edit, especially if one of them was only made to justify the other.

As a rule I am not in favour, as I do not see that any instance of changing "Hot to" to "How do I" as significantly improving the clarity of the question and as such it's chances of being understood and answered.

I would also point out that the title of the question becomes the title of the page, the page consists of more than just the question, but the answers and comments also, and as such a "How to" topic for the page as a whole can be considered more relevant than a "How do I?".  In search results, "How to" implies you will receive instruction, but "How do I" can imply someone seeking help without necessarily implying that they got it.

EDIT: The exception to the rule is if you are providing an answer or other material that would cause a bump to the top anyway.  To be clear whilst the triviality is a concern, my actual problem with it is the unnecessary bump that is associated with it, so if it's going to bump anyway, then edit away!

We use it a lot round here, too much for it not to be!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Certainly a word. Used correctly in your answer.


















I think there are three parts to this question.

The first is whether it is desirable for questions to say "How do I" rather than "How to". As a matter of style, I prefer a title lable rather than a complete sentence, but I do recognize that some estemed members of this site encourage complete sentence titles (even if they themselves occasionally use label phrases rather than complete sentences). I think a fuller label is preferable, but don't particularly want the title of the the question to be a complete, gramatically correct question.

If we take as given that my preferences are ideosynchratic (or wrong) and that "How do I" is, in fact, better than "How to" in question titles, the next question is whether this is a sufficiently substantial edit to merit editing a post. I would again argue that the answer is no: if, in the course of making other substantive edits to a post, one also wants to trivially improve the title, go ahead, but it is certainly not sufficient to cross the "substantial" bar necessary to justify editing.

Next, I believe, there is the question of whether a large string of such edits in a short period of time is ever in order. I would most emphatically assert that this is not good for the site. To have the home screen full of questions brought to the surface for a three character edit, thus drowning out the newly asked questions is the very definition of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28Monty_Python%29spam.

Finally, I would say it would be my preference to take this one step further: not only should one not change "how to" to "how do I", but any edit that merely changes a clear title into a complete sentence question and does nothing else to clarify the title and contains no substantive edits to the content of the post falls into the category of "too trivial" to deserve an edit. Such edits, I believe, should be avoided.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Daniels comments about the title as label are an accurate reflection of the point I was making (or trying to) in my comment to the question.


















In my opinion, if an edit improves a question in some way, and someone's willing to make it, they should feel free to make the change. Whether this is fixing a typo or retagging the question, the accumulation of all these tiny improvements will lead to a higher quality post, and a higher quality site.

I also think that, the majority of the time, a question's title should also be a question, as it helps the person asking the question to identify the core focus of their problem, which in turn helps the people looking at the recent questions list get a better idea of what the questions in the list are asking. For people with the same problem in the future, the similar questions search in the "Ask Question" page is based off question titles, and the title is placed in the <title> of the page, which is given additional weight in a Google search. Finally, having the majority of the posts on the site phrased in the form of a question serves to improve consistency, as well as to serve as an example to new users of how to ask their questions.

That said, simply changing "How to" to "How do I" long after the question is asked and answered really only serves that last point as it didn't help the asker, the answerers, and provides no additional keywords for searchers. Still, I don't think that anyone's arguing that changing the title is bad if there's other stuff that needs to be changed in the body and tags of the question as well, which indicates that an edit that changes the title from "How to" to "How do I", taken by itself, is at least not a negative.

The point of contention comes with the fact that there's also a 'cost' to each edit - every time a question or answer is edited it's put back at the top of the active queue, the default sort order for the front page. If lots of edits are done in quick succession, they drowned out the actual open questions making it harder to get questions answered, and to find questions to be answered.

The correct solution to this, in my opinion, is to build in support for non-bumping edits into the system. Wikipedia is a good example here - nobody gets chastised for fixing typos, and there's a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help%3aMinor_editway to mark edits as 'minor', indicating that the edit does not change the content and does not need to reviewed.

Barring that, however, I agree that edits to older posts should be done no more than a few at a time, and that it's better to use those edits to fix up the posts that really need it rather than to change something minor. I disagree, however, that any edit that improves the post should not be made because it's 'too minor'. The quantity and frequency of the edits is the problem, not the fact that they change comparatively little.

Say... 25 characters or less?


















Before I seem like I'm completely against this idea, let just start by saying that I have no problem with our site expanding its focus to include iTunes Connect. It's a subject matter that is currently underserved by the rest of the Stack Exchange network, and it would be great to have a place to ask those kinds of questions.

I've often thought that Ask Different should have a sister site for programming for Apple's Mac OS X and iOS platforms, which include both Objective-C as well as iTunes Connect stuff. However, although I've followed a few proposals here and there on Area 51, nothing's managed to get to the commit phase.

So returning to the original question, my reservation about having questions about developer programs is that I'm concerned that most of the questions that can and will be asked are questions about policy, or are questions that only Apple can answer, or even just complaints/rants about the system. And as a personal note, I'm also completely unfamiliar with this side of Apple. Although subject matter expertise isn't a requirement to moderate, sometimes it's necessary to have some basic knowledge in the subject in order to determine if something's a duplicate, not a real question, etc. With the upcoming moderator election, it's possible we'll be getting new moderators more capable of handling these topics, so we can definitely revisit this then.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wanted to ask this before the election so that even if the answer is no or not now, it's at least on the radar. Where the site may or may nor go seems to be very close to selecting the moderators for the upcoming year.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I notice you still haven't nominated yourself. Why not be the change you wish to see in the site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just went to register but it appears to be closed or broken?!?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://elections.stackexchange.com/ - all good now


















Our https://apple.stackexchange.com/badges?tab=tagslist of tag badges is pathetically small in my opinion, and in dire need of changes, the most obvious of which is iphone -> ios, yet I feel that any iOS answer (iPhone, iPod, iPod-touch and related, iPad) should count towards iOS. The inability to make a tag synonym that is iPhone, iPad, iPod -> ios, that preserves their original name, yet all count towards iOS is a huge shortcoming with regard to the Apple ecosystem in Stack Exchange's tagging engine.

Onto the actual questions I'm asking, since I just hit all over the figurative dartboard with the opening paragraph.


Who is able to choose a site's tag badges?
What tag badges should we add?
Should the Stack Exchange engine be modified in order to allow tag synonyms to be displayed as their given name, but count towards a master badge? Again, this means that you could tag, and display iphone, on a question, but all stats count towards an all encompassing ios tag. I see this also very relevant in OS X desktop and server versions, and sprawling hardware names like macbook and ipod. (This should probably be written up on MSO, but I'd be happy with discussion here first.)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How are tag badges chosen?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://data.stackexchange.com/apple/query/2357/how-many-upvotes-do-i-have-towards-tag-specialist-badges is helpful to see where various users (and yourself) stack up to tag badge progress.


















So we've https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1030/should-we-have-posts-on-meta-that-arent-questions-that-can-be-answeredestablished that it's appropriate for meta to contain questions that aren't really answerable. Which suggests that the algorithm whereby Community♦ randomly bumps questions without accepted answers to the top of the list might not be a particularly good idea in meta.

Case in point: podcast #2 was just bumped to the top of meta. Really?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could Community♦ not bump questions without accepted answers on meta?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know whether this is a bug, a feature request, or a "feature" removal request.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Feature request, IMO. [Community ♦](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/) is doing it's intended behavior, behavior I don't think it should have on any meta site. (At least not by default. If someone thinks it should be on a meta, that should be their exception, not the rule.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where is the list of what and how http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/ (aka [Community ♦](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/)) does it's tasks? Sometimes I'd ask it to just go calculate the square root of it's user number and come back when it has an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It just has to use its imagination, @bmike, and the answer's easy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Someone downvoted this -- if you just think this isn't a priority, great, but if you have an argument why it's actually desirable to randomly bump unanswered posts on meta, please do respond; I'd love to hear the argument.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If no one ever answers this, it can be performance art by @community


















It should be a comment for preference.  If it doesn't have a firm answer or suggestion then it's effectively discussion.  It may well allow another user to bounce off it and create a genuine answer, but the best place is in a comment.  If it's a good one, it can still be up voted as a great comment.

The only problem with using a comment is the lack of newline ability, and the fact that there is a character limit.  I have on occasion posted what I new to be too long for a comment even though that's what it was as a question, but I put a proviso explaining that at the top asking people not to vote on it.  Technically, that's not really a good thing to do, but the guy needed some help reading between the lines.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the answer!


















I think it's OK to assume the asker is using Mac OS unless they explicitly specify otherwise in the title, body, or tags of their question (best to check all 3).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps we could add something to the FAQ about that -- "Questions about Apple software running on Microsoft Windows are on topic, but please specify that in your question, as answerers here are otherwise apt to assume you are using a Mac."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel unfortunately we can only edit the top section of the FAQ ("what kinds of questions can I ask here?"). maybe tag wiki edits world work?


















I would just use the Apple shortcuts.  The assumption if nothing is stated has to be that the user is on a Mac.  Doing a tag search yields the following stats for results this year to date:

[itunes] [windows] - 2 hits

[itunes] [os x] - 2 hits

[itunes] [mac] - 4 hits

[itunes] - 100+ hits

So by some very basic maths (with the obvious problem that some of the [itunes] only search results were also for [ios]/[ipad]/[iphone]/[ipod] etc etc where shortcuts are not appropriate anyway) would suggest less than 2% of questions explicitly state Windows.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, though on questions that *do* state "windows", it isn't really an issue. It's only on the ones that don't say either way that it comes up.


















Warning: I'm not good at naming things.

What came to mind for a name is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppletalkAppleTalk.
I'm not convinced that this is a great option, since it's pretty obscure.
That said, it may be better than nothing (maybe?).

I think OS 8 was the last new version of AppleTalk, but it was a *big* deal on my ][GS back in 1987.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel OS 8 is less than a year younger than me :)


















Chat Different (notice the space) as the room name, with the subtext line reading "Here's to the crazy ones"

Because the whole "Think Different" campaign launched with the reflection:


  Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
  The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things
  differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for
  the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or
  vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because
  they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They
  explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.
  Maybe they have to be crazy. How else can you stare at an empty canvas
  and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never
  been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
  We make tools for these kinds of people. While some see them as the
  crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to
  think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

I haven't got a preference for the subtext yet, but I'm resisting up voting the "misfits" ones as I think it's a bit of a relic

The rest, less so.  More mainstream than misfit.   It's still fun though, I would identify with being a square peg for example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Macs may be mainstream, but as became clear during the town hall, AD culture might well still be round pegs in square holes wrt the rest of SEb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can say that again.   That's why Ask Different is still such a great name.

And I actually have a distinct answer. Apple is a company, an ecosystem, it's "level of skill" ranges from "learning to right click", to "programming an app" (and really, much harder). We're "softer" on some questions because it's relevant to the community. That probably shouldn't change. Ask Different is unlike almost all of the rest of Stack Exchange, scope/content-wise.


 http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/12928/bmikebmike http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311740#3311740noted:  I think Jason has formulated my thoughts a bit better here. It's not an excuse to allow soft questions - but I think that some more advanced users look down on beginner questions as soft or obvious. I feel the balance is good but could always be better and having better questions is something moderators can make room for by helping cull the topics that lead to confusion / dissension and idle chatter.

 http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/12928/bmikebmike http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311767#3311767continued:  I'm all for closing questions that are too soft since they rob space from the ones that need room and attention to grow. I'm also of the mind that the CW / poll type questions have to really, really shine to be worth keeping around. That's something the moderators will need to be in agreement to keep the site both fair and focused.

It's no good allowing a bad one to start, then stopping it after 2 days.  Some are great (Tiny things), others straight up wrong (Making safari perfect).

I think we need to be sensitive to building users up to asking great, hard questions. I'll certainly follow up with other moderators to see where this "soft" reputation is founded as this was the first I've heard of this and don't know if I agree or not with the characterization at this point.


















Hover over the favourite button, and you see the following text (Spelling mistakes amended ;) )

"This is a favourite question (click again to undo)"

This implies that you have made the question a favourite already, and clicking will undo it.  But the text is the same regardless of if you have made it a favourite or not.

I came across a question that I set, and saw that it had a favourite count.  When I hovered and read the text, I clicked again to undo, not realising I had done that to my own question.  Of course this just increased the count as the first favourite was from someone else.

Can we amend the text to make it context insensitive?  Something like: "Click to toggle this question as a favourite" or "click to set/unset this question as a favourite"

Even e.g. the Safari bookmarks bar doesn't show them and thereby reduces distraction, although bookmarks (and their favicons) are one of the few areas they make sense, since they improve recognition.

Due to the length of my name, it's often wrapped in comments. This is entirely understandable. However, it often gets wrapped like this:

If you are advocating that Stack Exchange removes the space between the end of the comment and the username, or linebreaks the dash ending the comment, I am 100% opposed to that.

This is standard browser line-wrapping behavior. When content hits the end of a displayed line, it rewinds to the last (non-breaking) space, and then moves all the content onto the next line.

You're just going to keep running into this problem.

So what can you do? My only suggestion is to change your username. The only three names I could think of that could permanently resolve this issue would be Timothy-Mueller-Harder, TMH, or TM-H. You could abbreviate it in some other fashion, such as Timothy M-H, but that won't fix the issue. You will inevitably post a comment of some length that pushes not only M-H onto the next line, but Timothy as well.

The problem is subtler than you first imagine, and more difficult to fix.  A question asking about (for example) the use of a hardware feature (say the magnets for Smart Covers on an iPad) is nothing to do with iOS, and a tag synonym that puts all iPad tags under iOS would catch a lot of these incorrectly in my view.

If you apply the same logic to the desktop hardware as well as mobile, then anything tagged Macbook should count to a master OSX tag, resulting in OSX being diluted with questions obout magsafe, batteries and trackpad problems etc.

A better solution might be to take a long hard look at our tags and hit them with a very big stick.  Go to the main site tags page, and filter on iOS,  there are 13 different ones which is overkill to me.  I would suggest that as a start a clean up should remove the IOS-5 and IOS5 obvious problems, but we should also consider dropping minor revision ones, IOS-4.2 (and indeed IOS4.2) and IOS-4.3 etc are really not needed down to this level of granularity, and if they are we should add them all, and even question the need to add 4.2.2 etc for consistency.

The OSX tags do not suffer quite the same problem in that there are (largely) only major versions listed, but they have other problems due to the colloqial versions such as Lion as well as the version numbers.  Consider the existance of the following tags:


Lion 
Lion-Server
OSX
OSX-server
OSX-Lion
OSX-10.7
10.7
10.7.2
MACOS
MACOSX


I could ask a question that I could apply each of those tags to if I had a 10.7.2 Lion Server (and I do...), but let's face it most will just pick one, it's (likely) not synonymed properly and as such we have several competing tags all creeping up to the badge tag required count which would likely all exceed it if consolidated.

So, in summary, I don't necessarily agree with point 1, point 2 was answered elsewhere (they are automatic on count), and 3 would be good but won't be a panacea.

While we are talking about improving the tag system, then in addition to your suggestions, I would suggest a way of selecting a tag from a list, and then be able to dynamically filter a list based on whether the chosen tag is a master or synonym as an aid to being able to select a group of tags and investigate their current synonym structure, which is almost impossible except as a manual endeavour at present (you can only type one filter).

We as a group of active site users that care about tags can be on the lookout to correct many of the highest voting questions so that they have the correct main tag associated with them. Quality tagging - making sure the minimum tags and tags that can stand alone are used will in effect better aggregate the votes and result in better tag badging algorithmically.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A second lever to influence this will be engaging new users to ensure they know that voting up questions in the tags they wish to learn will assist in raising the tags reputation on the site so that answers are properly rewarded. We need to encourage good voting and tagging and this will sort itself over time.

I checked with several other moderators and the low traffic nature of this site (and really all the metas except for the main one that actually carries reputation on its own) means that it's something that would add another place for moderators to check for very few questions needing an edit. 

Does this answer your question? Perhaps we can chat over the changes you'd like to make in a chat room?

Perhaps the answer is for sites where the mods want this could lobby for full reputation - same meta handling as MSO.


















Some questions about this software have been closed as it is not released,

However the OS has been released to developers. This means there is a chance we can have questions answered by anyone with the system.

[Can I ask questions about a not-yet-publicly released version of an Apple Operating System like iOS 6?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/1331/8546) is more current and links to this question, so I suggest removing the *faq* tag from this question. Let's keep [Ask Different meta FAQ](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/faq) current and uncluttered, especially since there's *another* [Ask Different meta FAQ](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/faq).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One should read the NDA on 10.8.4 very carefully


















There are a few reasons why questions about pre-release software is off-topic for Ask Different:


A lot of companies, most notably Apple, require everyone with access to pre-release software to sign an NDA. Anyone that asks or answers questions about software covered under this NDA are in violation of its terms, and I don't think having open questions on the site tempting users to break their NDA is a very fair thing for Ask Different to do.
Pre-release software often isn't even complete. This means that the answers to the questions can change before the software is even released. Granted, answers to questions about released software do sometimes change over time, but not with the volatility of pre-release software.
Pre-release software often has many bugs that will get fixed before its released. This means that questions about application behavior or finding workarounds will be obsolete by the time the software is released.


It's possible that there are questions about pre-release software that aren't affected by any of these rules, but most are by at least one and it's easier to have a blanket policy against such questions than to have to decide for each one.

With regard to the questions about Mountain Lion, #1 definitely applies, as well as #3. #2 may not apply to announced features, but they could still conceivably change before it's released this summer. (I remember when Apple announced ZFS for Mac OS X Server and it went nowhere)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For clarity, part of http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#questions should be moved to http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask (with a little rephrasing).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Exactly. Questions about pre-release software are almost all too localized, because pre-release software changes so fast and has so many bugs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GrahamPerrin I would if I could, however mods can only edit the questions section of the FAQb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And darn that Apple for releasing a beta version of Messages app on OSX. It isn't going to be localized to less than 6 months of use for the general public given the release schedule as communicated. It also joins Siri as another beta service that is shipping today and users will expect to use and have questions fielded somewhere.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I'm on the fence about allowing questions about Messages. Yes, it's technically pre-release, but I'd argue in name only. The software has been released and is intended for wide adoption.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel strongly that Siri and Messages for OSX should be immediately and explicitly on topic and their tag wikis updated accordingly. See http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1119/despite-the-general-rule-to-not-answer-questions-about-beta-products-should-we for consensus building and discussion :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would post a response to the question, except that I agree wholeheartedly with Kyle's response here and have nothing to add. Meta is the appropriate place to argue for breaking precedent, but in this case, I believe we are well served by following our general rule that pre-release software is off-topic. In contrast with, say, the example linked in the previous comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Kyle: curious why the NDA issue is a non-factor over at SO, but is a factor here. Thoughts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@p.campbell For the longest time I was ambivalent about allowing questions covered by an NDA on Ask Different, but someone made the case to me that it was unfair to dangle a question whose answer was protected by an NDA in front of those who have signed one, tempting them to break it. Besides, NDA'd software is usually also feature-incomplete and buggy, both of which are generally discouraged/disallowed as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that - with today's announcements - we should begin opening limited Mountain Lion questions. (In particular, on the [Tech Specs](http://www.apple.com/osx/specs/) page, Apple publicly lists the supported machines.)


















Along with Kyle's points about Ask Different policies, I favor having Mountain Lion pre-release issues reported directly to Apple rather than discussed here, because this ultimately helps Apple improve the software before it is released.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a false dichotomy. Raising an issue here doesn't preclude reporting it to Apple, and vice versa.


















Whenever deciding whether Ask Different should allow or close:


consider whether Apple makes the allowance. 




Allowance of questions that may be asked in public

If Apple provides a public area for discussion of an Apple product, then Ask Different should not close or delete questions about that product.

Example: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1268/8546for Messages, Apple provided a discussion area long before the release of OS X 10.8 with Messages.

Closure of questions that should be asked in private

https://appleseed.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SeedPortalAppleSeed participants should https://appleseed.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SeedPortal.woa/wa/faquse the discussion board. 

Mac Developer Program members should use http://devforums.apple.com/Apple Developer Forums and other areas designated by Apple.

The point of the meta discussion is to propose changing the scope of the site, which is then documented in the FAQ. The meta discussion determines what the FAQ should say, not the other way around.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, I was disoriented. Didn't realise that we're in meta!


















The general rule is that all questions on beta software and services are off-topic, out of scope, and should be closed on Ask Different according to our FAQ. However, we now have two shipping products that are highly friendly and desirable to end users yet still in beta:


http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.htmlSiri
http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/messages-beta/Messages


Would sticking to our FAQ and closing all questions on these two products be more ridiculous than editing their tag wikis to indicate that we are consciously waiving the Beta prohibition on these due to the wide dissemination, huge audience, and/or utility to our users to have a forum on these "indeterminate" beta products from Apple?

There are no signs Siri will be out of beta despite selling millions of iPhone 4S weekly since October 4, 2010. All signs point to Messages being generally and widely available for 6 or more months until OS X Mountain Lion ships.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Despite the general rule to not answer questions about beta products, should we allow Messages on OS X and Siri on iPhone 4S questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great question!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed; thanks for clarifying this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For link purposes: [Pre-release software that doesn't require an NDA - Ask Different Meta](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/798/8546)


















In my opinion, Messages and especially Siri are pre-release/beta software in name only, much like GMail was for years and years while millions of people relied on it. So I'd say yes, that Messages and Siri should be allowed as questions.

However, I fully recognize the difficulty in applying the "in name only" test to other forms of beta software. More concrete guidelines on exactly what constitutes "pre-release software" need to be worked out. But for the time being, I'm OK with questions about Messages and Siri.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like having a place to think these things out so if/when we try it - we can circle back and ensure the goals are met with limited or acceptable downsides over time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. The line could be that this beta is available publicly to anyone (not reserved for developers - and possibly subject to NDA)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - NDA could be a very, very good defining line. No one is signing a NDA to get these softwares. I would wager anyone with Mountain Lion or beta iOS has verbally (or written/electronically) signed an NDA.(barring theft and intentional or careless breaking of an NDA)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. Public Beta software is fair game. People will be using it, and it's disclosed publicly, why shouldn't THE apple stackexchange site field such questions? In Siri's case, there are AT LEAST (assuming they use the feature) 4 million users.(see Source link)

Why should we discount the software considering the probable widespread use, and questions that will come from that?


[Source](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/10/apple-iphone-4s-4-million-sold.html)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this. However, 'temporary bug' questions ([example](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41118/messages-beta-broken)) are still too localized and should be closed, just as we close questions about small bugs in released apps that have been fixed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For AppleSeed, Apple describes *pre-release* developmental software as [unpolished](https://appleseed.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SeedPortal). As use cases vary greatly — it's not unusual for a build to be described as perfect by one person, unusable by another — I doubt that expanded definitions of *pre-release* (or of *beta* or whatever) will do anything to reduce future appearances of meta questions such as this. For me the guiding principle is whether, for an Apple product of any status, [Apple initiates discussion that is public](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/1268/8546).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Apple Developer area offers no meaning of [pre-release](https://developer.apple.com/support/resources/prerelease-software.html). This **simplicity is ideal**; to developers, the expression *pre-release* should be self-explanatory.


















I'll repeat my comment here. I agree with bmike and Kyle, Messages and Siri questions should be allowed here.

It's not the same kind of beta as OS X 10.8.



A solution could be creating the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/siri-betasiri-beta and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messages-betamessages-beta tags. And, for the time of the beta, make https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sirisiri and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagesmessages synonym.

That way, when they're out of beta, we can remove the synonym and have questions about the official release.

I also don't see a need for messages-ios and messages-osx tags until we have a few hundred questions or there is some problem with them together at a later time.

When I'm mentioned in chat, my name in the person's message is highlighted blue. 99CCFF, to be precise. The problem is, that's exactly the same color as the default OS X highlight color, and I always try to click out of the selection.

I distinction in the FAQ as what constitutes a Beta would be useful.  For example I would consider my ML install as a closed beta, which requires account level access that is covered by NDA and isn't appropriate for on topic content.  However if it is an Open beta this should be relaxed somewhat.  As anyone has been not only able, but encouraged to download messages, then I would be seinsible to allow it as a suitable on topic question base.  Especially for Siri which is not only open Beta but included in a shipping product that you pay genuine money for.

Beta or not, if it's something anyone can download without needing a lawyer, it should probably find a home here. Staying away from NDA topics is good for a whole host of reasons.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With respect, I disagree: the FAQ for Ask Different should **not** attempt to answer the greater question of how people understand *beta*. Attempting to define or redefine things such as *beta* or *pre-release*, within answers to FAQ, will add unnecessary length to that page. Worse: definitions may be contentious. I'd prefer fewer (frequently) asked questions about the FAQ, so let's aim for answers that are inarguable. Depending on the outcome of this question, we might need a separate meta question about FAQ uses of expressions such as *beta*.

We'll spread gifts!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How are we supposed to share links to answers we composed? Through the link button on the *question* or by posting the permalink to the *answer*?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel thanks for the question! Both ways work great and are detectable for us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any way to see a list of posts I've shared out? Or even just ones that I've shared out that have had their links clicked?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or, to continue @IanC. 's request, is there a way to see how close we are to completing the task, or to verify that we have, in fact, completed it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For your own purposes you can keep track of your posts this week and which ones you shared with your friends via social media. When we analyze the data next week, results will be available :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I forgot to ping you to let you know I edited the answer out of the question and into the answer part of the site. Feel free to respond and I'll delete "my copy of the answer you provided"


















I'm going to assemble a twitter list of Ask Different users from @StackApple, and just wanted to give everyone the opportunity to let me know if they don't want to be included. The purpose of the list will be to make it easier to follow and communicate with the Ask Different community on twitter. We think the Ask Different community is awesome and we firmly believe that the users are what make the site great, so we want to give back a little publicity and recognition to you guys. This way, people will know who you are!

We'll assemble the list by going through all the Ask Different users who have twitter handles in their profile, and narrow it down to people who are actually active on Ask Different and on twitter. So, if you don't regularly use this site or never tweet about Apple products, you won't be added.

If for any reason you don't want to be included on the list, please let me know by responding to this post. Also, if you do want to be on the list, please make sure your twitter handle is in your user profile.

Thanks!  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Assembling a Twitter list of Ask Different usersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a shame there is no dedicated Twitter field in the list of profile fields.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But there is a data query to assemble a partial list http://data.stackexchange.com/apple/queries?q=twitter and since Apple is making moves to have twitter be the canonical social media account for OS X as well as iOS, we might want to see if a custom data query could be embedded in our site and nicened up by the site designers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Here's a [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/brianbondy/apple) to get you started.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @LoïcWolff! I will look through it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, I can just put "Twitter: @mytwitterhandle" in the About Me section of my profile?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bneely yep, that works.


















I would welcome a more formal way to access this information than the existing http://data.stackexchange.com/apple/queriesdata.stackexchange.com dumps which seem to access a several weeks old dump of the user data instead of polling things that are active on the profile today or perhaps yesterday.

Twitter has been the de-facto social media account when it was added to iOS 5 and the public accounts of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion indicate that twitter will also be the "default" or canonical social media account for users of Apple hardware and software.

Would this be worth making into a feature request so that Ask Different has a built in way to get at any and all users that have chosen to link publicly to their user profiles here?

The current data query only shows rows where users have the string twitter, and doesn't actually extract the user names or allow a list to be directly constructed without further scraping or data manipulation when querying the database. 

Perhaps we should wait for your one-time list and see how useful people find this before asking for code changes to the entire site for one sub-group's desire to have more twitter with our stack exchange.

I've only cast three votes on meta this week, and yet I was just awarded the Vox Populi badge. I see there was a spate of awarding this particular badge, but I haven't noticed a spate of meta voting.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why were a whole bunch of users just awarded the Vox Populi badge on meta?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's get this to the main meta if it's not already there...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I got it too, but didn't vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike there's no need to move this to MSO.  Here is fine.


















We just deployed a change that affects the voting badges.  This is why you see a number of these badges being awarded.

For more information about this change, you can see https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/123048/140548this answer.

Note that there was a bug with Vox Populi only that awarded too many of them (beyond the expected more for retroactive awards) and a fix has been deployed.  The erroneous awards have been cleaned up.

Come join Ask Different and http://drbrendan.com/Dr. Brendan for a party to honor Steve Jobs on his birthday. The party will start around 3 pm EST, and will take place outside the flagship Apple Store in NYC (59th Street and Fifth Avenue). 

There will be black turtlenecks, cupcakes, and dancers. For more information, see this http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/fans_day_fete_for_jobs_HQzFUcSxhYb531oFfG6kmJNew York Post article covering the event. This event was also http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000075169covered by CNBC this morning, so we're hoping for a great turnout! 

If you can't make it to the event, we will be live tweeting it from @StackApple, so follow along!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5NYC area users - join us to celebrate Steve Jobs' Birthday!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sorry, but this seems more than a little exploitive of the memory of Steve Jobs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin SJ's vision permeates tech culture and I prefer to celebrate this in a positive way!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SethRogers I have no problem with people celebrating Steve Jobs in their own way, though in this case I think it's a bit tasteless. However, this is ostensibly a promotion for Stack Exchange - it was mentioned in the NY Post article and the CNBC interview; you even had a Stack Exchange shirt on. And that's what I object to - using the memory of Steve Jobs, who has only been dead a few *months* to promote the company and this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it's a birthday party for a visionary we all admired @KyleCronin. Point taken though. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The CNBC interview is all about what big fans Seth and Brendan are of Steve Jobs - they only mention Ask Different to say where Seth is from. I think it's a very tasteful interview, and we don't intend for this to be an excuse for a promotion. But we do see your point Kyle. Don't want you to think we're being insensitive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Ask Different moderators weren't involved in advance of this promotion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not aware of any site users including the moderators that knew of this before the blog post went up. Of course the SE employees / CHAOS team and employees that printed up the balloons would be excluded.


















When ever i asked question in this forum. i got some common comments like what is your system's specifications. 
So i want to propose this feature request that while registering, user should provide the specifications of his system and it will be shown on mouse over event or something.

I will also feel comfortable when i have some knowledge of system requirements of OP system.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think system specifications should show as signature?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5for this http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41450/how-can-i-tell-if-a-game-will-run-on-my-machine and this http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41611/parallels-with-windows-8-is-very-slow this question i asked for my system specifications. So i thought about this feature request.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think those were removed because they weren't relevant and cluttered up the question.


















Stack Exchange as a whole does not do signatures. When I'm reading a question regarding an iOS device, I hate skimming over way too-many lines of Desktop/Laptop specifications, especially when they delve into listing certain low-level apps that they felt were relevant when creating their signature.

Not to even mention how out-of-date this information gets.

It is, in my opinion, not unreasonable to expect the user asking a question to provide this information when necessary.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5so do you think that without system information answer will not out-of-date? ok i will propose that create some tag or something for system specification. so that it will be easy to add in your question when it asked from other users.


















I've seen similar systems implemented on other sites (like the Apple Discussions).

The idea is good (force people to know and tell us their system info), but this kind of feature isn't always helpful or practical, for a few reasons:


It isn't always necessary
Many questions (especially those that relate to software) don't require system info.
All of it is never necessary
I've never seen a question that requires background about every single piece of hardware that the asker owns. Unless there was a good way to only include the relevant system info, having it all there would be distracting and confusing ('Wait, is it the MacBook or the iMac that has the problem?')
It takes up a lot of space
Listing every piece of software and hardware that you own takes up space and adds clutter. There's no reason to take up more space outside of a question's body, especially when system info isn't relevant.
People forget to update it
In my experience, people are more likely to include current system info if they write it into their question as they're asking. Centralized info (profile-linked) tends to be forgotten about and gets stale.


I don't think that adding system info to the signature is the right path to take.

What I would like to see, though, is another 'reminder' item shown while posting a question that tells people to be sure to include all relevant hardware and software information.

Of course people wouldn't always follow it, but commenting and asking for info is easy, and people generally respond to it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, posting system information as a signature among Mac users often turns into show-and-tell or bragging about just how cool one's personal rig is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would go so far as to say, it's actively harmful in many cases as it removes the details from the question and promotes disregard for that sort of information when it is attached by default to all questions. Adding this seems very against the signal to noise design of the stack exchange network unless some sophisticated code were in place to prevent the times when this data should not be included.


















I've put together a https://stackapps.com/questions/3081/senotifier-a-stack-exchange-inbox-notifier-for-mac-os-xstatus bar notifier for Stack Exchange sites (inspired by Google Notifier) and I thought I'd ask here to get some feedback on a couple of things.



I've developed this on Lion and am curious about whether it works on previous releases of OS X (or whether this even matters very much, in practical terms). This is my first Mac OS X app ever, so I'm not even sure what issues are important.

Also, it sort of needs an application icon, so if you're feeling inclined, artwork would get you a mention and a link in the About panel!

Any other comments and suggestions are welcome.

I believe this type of question will be down-voted since it's an open-ended question and it's doubtful there could be one correct answer. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Huzzah! Voting is _very important_ for showing that a question is contentious. Just because something is popular doesn't mean it should remain.


















While I can't speak directly for the sub-culture of the Ask Different site, I don't feel that either question is suitable for the site.

Both of these questions are nothing more than lists (or requests for lists) and badly maintained ones at that.  Specifically, the question you refer to which is still open:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82/which-os-x-applications-do-you-find-indispensableWhich OS X Applications do you find indispensable?

Is "Not Constructive".  How many of you really have all 210 applications installed on your Mac? Furthermore, what is indispensable for one is almost certainly not for another. The problem where a majority of answers to the question are not selectable as being right. A handful of well intentioned answers can be read and digested in a short period of time. You can see how hard it is to get even through the first page of answers. The rest are effectively buried. Well intentioned or not, these large questions have problems of scale that don't afflict small targeted questions.

On top of that, https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/354the highest voted answer, DropBox isn't even an application, it's a website which has an application for the platform.

Both of them should be closed as "Not Constructive".  Like the book list questions that are very contentious on Stack Overflow (to say the least), they might be valuable, and they might have a place on the Internet, but that place isn't here.

Questions of this sort simply do not fit the format or vision of this site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would encourage everyone that doesn't feel these sort of questions are useful to down vote them. Talking here, discussing all make it easier for the mods to step in and either fix the deficiencies or perhaps close these sort of questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/697/how-to-kill-off-community-wiki-entries makes a good point where not being specific in the question body "buries" lots of good answers. It would be far better for the site to have 5 good questions about specific input devices that solve specific needs. For that reason, the catch all questions are often down voted and closed.


















Here is the question https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41969/what-input-devices-do-you-find-to-be-an-indespensable-part-of-using-your-machttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41969/what-input-devices-do-you-find-to-be-an-indespensable-part-of-using-your-mac

The question is not intended to be about shopping recommendations? After seeing other questions such as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82/which-os-x-applications-do-you-find-indispensableWhich OS X Applications do you find indispensable? I though it would be useful for such a question to exist for hardware input devices and the things people are doing with those devices to make make an impact on their user experience.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is wrong with this hardware question for Ask Different and is there a better way to ask it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you so much for sticking with this! The short answer is we're trying to cut down on all CW posts and may want to cull some of the other questions you mention that have all the "special rules" needed to explain that they are not just a normal Q&A but instead big lists for voting and discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Define "CW posts"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5CW = Community Wiki, which has generally been used for list-style posts in the past.


















My biggest concern about your post is that this is very unspecific question and unlikely to be helpful to the community on the long run:


It's not a real problem you face. 
Most answers will probably be valid for any computer enthousiast - no matter if he's using Windows, Linux or OSX. 
Hardware does not get updated, but upgraded

We need to be aware of that a hardware upgrade is a replacement of hardware.  Why do I mean mention this? Software does not change it's name over time. When it get's a major update, the version number changes.

With hardware, a name is closely related to a unique product. But the product becomes unavailable or outdated over time. Hence, the list of answers will become very bloated in time and require steady clean-up.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that's the point of hardware input devices, they are in some cases around for a longer time than originally intended. That does not reduce there functionality, in fact it sometime might enhance the opportunity for more interesting use cases and or hacking...


















What sorts of answers was the "what devices are indispensable" were you hoping to get? What problem were you trying to solve? I feel the question would be better if you asked that deeper question and not the warm-up "list all awesome input devices ever" question.

A question that allows any answer to be equally valid makes for a noisy mess.

Who can do without a keyboard or a mouse - there's two banner answers without thinking past a millisecond.

Now - if you had a practical problem. Say what hardware is indispensable for someone with cerebral palsy? By listing a specific condition everyone can gain value from the information, expertise and answers. I don't know if a magic mouse or a trackpad is better for someone with that level of motor skill. By having a real problem, the question becomes on topic.

Do read up on these links for background (most of the mods have had a lot of time to think over these issues and are thusly quick to jump on questions that are likely going to run afoul of the guidelines) and let me know in the comments if any of this makes sense to your particular question here. It still can be edited into shape and reopened - just will need some consensus built about what and how it will exist given the goals of the site.

So I think the best solution is to let this question go and hope for a the creation of better more focused question relating to input devices in more specific situations.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most excellent. I'm happy to help if you ever want to ping me in chat or ask here. Thanks for the response and digging into the why a bit with us.


















In the beginning, the Ask Different blog was only used to distribute podcast episodes.
Then we expanded to text articles.
Now we're expanding to videos.

As of today, the Ask Different blog has a http://vimeo.com/askdifferentblogVimeo account where we will be posting videos. We'll be starting with screencasts, and hopefully moving to other kinds of videos (hardware reviews, unboxings, iPhone release day footage, etc).

The first video has just been published. You can see it http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/keyboard-ninja-working-with-text-screencast/here.

If you're interested in contributing screencasts or have any questions, let me know! Post an answer to this question or ping me in the http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1408/ask-different-blogBlog chat room.
Here's how the process works.  


You, community member, create an awesome screencast of your Mac or iOS device (or other video).
You get in touch with me so we can transfer the video file via your
preferred method.
I process the video, do any necessary editing, and add our fancy Ask
Different Blog intro and outro.
You create a blog post with a short writeup for your video.
When the time comes, I upload the video and publish the blog post.




If you're interested in playing around or processing your own screencasts, you can download the template iMovie http://cl.ly/0r3I210h2l3k2d1b1D22project and http://cl.ly/3u462v3W3N0O150Y0V2Eevent. Place the project in ~/Movies/iMovie Projects and the event in ~/Movies/iMovie/iMovie Events.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Call for contributors: Ask Different Screencasts!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"In the beginning, Steve Woz and Jobs created the Apple I." And since then, a ton of stuff happened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, according to the biography they created phone phreaking hardware (Blue Boxes, I think?) before that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JasonSalaz Haven't read the biography yet, but it's on my list.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd tentatively like to do it. Not totally sure yet, but I'll definitely consider doing something(s).


















I'm in.  As I mentioned in Chat, if the final process is to use iMovie which we all have, then creating a dummie screencast with a snippet of video that we can replace as a form of template would be good.  Then we can do the (presumably) h.264 crunchdown for you and transfer a more sensibly sized file.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The iMovie template is definitely something I'll work on. The only issue is the little 'intro' card in the beginning, which is different for each screencast. Once I get the template done I'll post the details/instructions for the export settings that work well. Even after the template is made, I'll still be volunteering to edit and process the videos myself, in order to keep the barrier to entry nice and low.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You could make the "card" a blank card, and specify a font & size to use as a floating iMovie title just located over the blank area? Just type over the text and re-center to replaceb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, updated the question with the iMovie template.


















The party was a TON of fun! The cupcakes and turtlenecks set a really great vibe and there were a few dozen people who joined us for the event. SJ's memory was celebrated in such a positive way - people were all smiles reflecting on how SJ changed their lives personally or just how much they loved their Apple products.  

Unfortunately is was raining and cold, so people were afraid of getting their devices wet (mostly iPhones and iPods). The cupcakes also got a bit wet. All in all though, it was a memorable and happy birthday party for all the SJ admirers who attended.

I know some people got a bad taste in their mouths about this party; I'm sorry for that. For me, the party was a fun way to remember a visionary we all looked up to and those who made it out through the rain and cold seemed to have a really great time too. I think their was certainly a problem in the communication of this event, it was written about and publicized in a way that could have obscured the true joy of the party. 

Here's a snapshot taken from one attendee's iPhone:

To answer your question about its compatibility with previous versions of Mac OS X, I encountered an error when trying to run the program on my Panther machine. So it does not work on 10.3.9.

Just wanted to let everyone know we are going to turn back on autotweeting of http://twitter.com/askdifferent@AskDifferent for the time being. We experimented with tweeting manually, and now we want to see what will happen in terms of engagement if go back to autotweeting questions from our site. Right now, we haven't made any decisions about if/when we will go back to manual tweeting.



Update - we were able to find and acquire the twitter handle https://twitter.com/#!/askdifferent@askdifferent! From now on, we will be using @askdifferent instead of @stackapple, so remember that if you want to @ reply or mention us. 

Psst - if you don't follow @askdifferent already, feel free to do so :-)



Just wanted to let everyone know that we are testing out using https://twitter.com/#!/askdifferent@StackApple manually. Until very recently, @StackApple was only used to autotweet questions from our site, but we think that Twitter can be a really effective tool for engaging with the Ask Different community as well as other power users of Apple products. If you decide you want to follow @StackApple, you can expect to see more varied content, including


Great questions and answers
Blog posts from our site
Contest announcements
Industry news - such as product releases and posts from places like
MacRumors, TUAW, etc.


We will also make an effort to follow and highlight our users, as outlined in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1131/assembling-a-twitter-list-of-ask-different-usersthis post. Along those same lines, interacting with @StackApple on Twitter will be an easy way for people (users and non-users) to contact an employee of Stack Exchange.

Please be aware that this is an experiment to see whether investing resources in Twitter is a worthwhile way to grow the site. For now, only @StackApple and @StackGaming are being controlled manually. This may or may not happen with other sites in the future, based on whether this experiment is successful. Decisions about other sites' Twitter accounts will be made after this experiment is concluded. We don't have a date set for those decisions, or the end of this trial run.

Feedback on how the Twitters are being handled is welcome. Feel free to post comments, suggestions, etc. as answers here. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How is Stack Exchange using the @StackApple and @askdifferent Twitter accounts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey @Lauren - is this thing still on auto-tweet only?  Is there a way to share the password with mods to allow then to manual tweet some stuff in conjunction with the auto tweets (or allow us to send you guys stuff to tweet for us)?


















My initial suggestion would be to get / regain control of the AskDifferent account on twitter by sending a ticket to twitter explaining that it's a trademarked property of Stack Exchange and you wish to use that account for promoting this site.

Already, the site here is hampered by the incomplete branding where the site has two names depending on where you look. (In about half the places the name is Apple - in another half it's Ask Different).

In many places it is known as Ask Different. An informal poll of the moderators have us 100% against keeping "apple" in the branding for this site due to confusion. Now you are adding StackApple to the "nicknames" for the site.

I feel that the more you dilute the site name with "apple" - the more confusing and diluted your promotional efforts will become. I know this is swimming against the stream since all the Stack twitters start in Stack (except for ServerFault) - but I can find no other site where the twitter account has a word that isn't at all in the title. It'd be like @StackSuper_User was @StackComputers or something.

This naming certainly doesn't really affect how you use the account, but it may affect the likelihood that people will identify one with the other.

We've actually [tried to get access to @AskDifferent](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/654/who-owns-askdifferent-on-twitter) with no success. However, I'll try to look into it more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you deputize me, I'll file the paperwork with twitter, call them, pester them, whatever. The person doing the claim just needs to have an email from the company domain so perhaps a chaos member / actually employee would be better able to make the case. Ping me if you want help [wording the request](http://support.twitter.com/articles/18367-trademark-policy).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5just acquired the twitter handle AskDifferent :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5WOOT! I can't seem to follow it right now - perhaps twitter is changing it over or it's somehow locked / cached with the old handle. I'll post a real question here if I see any issues in another hour or so.


















I wanted to have some discussion on the tags for iPads.

We currently have a need to tag questions about the hardware being released on March 16, 2012 - and Apple is calling them the new iPad.

Pragmaticatically, we had https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipad-3ipad-3 questions crop up even before the announcement and later a synonym was defined to map https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/new-ipadnew-ipad to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipad-3ipad-3.

Until we have more time to digest how Apple will differentiate between the current new iPad and the original then new but now no longer new iPad with a http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1353canonical support article - I wanted to just open a question here for answers, discussion and comments in general about tagging iPads.

Also - please link to specific issues, discussion or problems in an answer here should you see any problems on the main site with tagging confusion around the names of iPads.

In general - use the iPad tag and only use the new-iPad tag when the question needs the additional qualifier.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag usage for iPads now that there are three generationsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also expect many people will weigh on on this and we can all learn / think through what significance to put in a name or in a tag. [Pro](http://www.macworld.com/article/165733/2012/03/apple_should_have_given_its_new_ipad_a_name.html) and [Con](http://www.macworld.com/article/165761/2012/03/forget_the_name_its_the_ipad_itself_that_matters.html) should make for fun armchair spectating and punditry in the coming weeks until we can actually use the new shiny atoms and bits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see the iPod and Macs (and even software) don't have tags for each generation (e.g. we have `macbook-pro` but not `macbook-pro-4,1` or `macbook-pro-17-inch-early-2008`. Is there a reason the iPad needs these extra tags when other devices don't?


















I dislike using new-ipad as a tag because it has a built-in expiration date - when the next iPad comes out the current one will no longer be the new one. Because of this, I'd like to use the generation number in the tag, like perhaps ipad-3rd-generation, ipad-2012 or even ipad-3 and define new-ipad as a synonym for those that we can redefine when a new iPad comes out.

You should describe what changes you made, and if necessary why you made them. Edit summaries like "added 23 characters in body" are automatically generated if you didn't provide one when editing. Sometimes this is OK if the edit is really simple or you don't have much time, but you really should always put something in there yourself when you can. It doesn't have to be long (or even a full sentence) but it should contain the essence of the changes you made. Like the edit on this post.

Admittedly, the majority of my edits have the automatically generated summaries, but that's because a lot of my edits are moderation-related. However, most users will edit to change the content, and in those cases the description is important.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I try to edit something without a summary, It won't let me submit the edit. I assume this is because at this amount of rep my edits are reviewed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, yes, it's probably because you're submitting edits for review instead of making them directly. All the more reason to develop good habits when editing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Comments are great for letting the OP know why you are changing things - with the system documenting what exactly changed, the why helps everyone make things better. Once you get the rep to edit without review, your comments are a big part of how people will see your focus and contributions here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, do keep in mind that those edit summaries can be read by anyone, so be descriptive but not insulting. "Changing this because the OP is a moron who can't spell" isn't a very nice thing to read in the change log.


















By all appearances, Apple is moving along the path it uses for iPod (classic and touch) and computers. The new machine is the iPad (Third Generation). Though the predecessor was known as the iPad 2 (likely to make it easier to identify cases and such), it's safe enough to ignore the market nomenclature and think of it as the iPad (Second gen.). Apply the same logic to the original iPad.

I suggest using the tags ipad as the over all category (which likely addreeses most questions at this time, relatively little is model specific, though that will change as the original model nears end of usable life) and the specialized ipad-1, ipad-2 and ipad-3 if it's necessary to identify specific models.

This seems to be the simplest and most direct classification. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree -- except for the part about "when it's necessary to identify specific models". I'm rethinking whether it's ever necessary to identify specific models in the tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have changed "when" to "if". At least at this time, I too am coming around to the idea of one tag—at least until model change make truly model-specific questions more frequent.


















The Tags page, when showing excerpts, automatically removes some key words from the beginning of excerpts (e.g. "Terminal is" from https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/terminalterminal). This mostly works fine, except for two things:


Capitalization inconsistency

It does not then capitalize the first remaining word, so some excerpts begin with "the" and some "The."
Extra deleted text

At least one tag (https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/backupbackup) has extra text removed. See the below screenshots.

If you have legitimate access to install and run Mountain Lion, then by definition you have a dedicated support area that is highly targeted towards discussion of it without the sorts of arbitrary limits of scope that we (rightly) have here.

Anyone who has a genuine question about ML that is more than curiosity for the purposes of being a Beta Hero at home is either ignoring the most suitable resource which they have paid cold hard cash for, or has managed to grab a copy by other means.

It's all about knowing your audience.  Anyone can buy an iPod, iPods are on topic for community crowd sourced support on an unofficial forum like this.  Likewise, anyone can join the developer program, but that doesn't mean the same rules apply.  The audience is markedly different.  Allowing such Beta questions restricts said questions to a minority portion of the audience, which means that only a tiny proportion of users can have valid input or view for the purpose of answering or even voting, and worse still at the risk of alienating that audience that sees this place as an accessible place to look for help and doesn't want to see a whole load of minimally useful stuff that they don't understand or care about which is likely to become outdated or inappropriate very quickly floating to the top.

I am a member of the developer program, and I wouldn't dream of asking any questions I have about it anywhere other than the official place.  I've paid for that support, I have not only a right to use it, but an expectation to see anything I do ask answered appropriately.  I don't have the same expectation of a free site on the internet, even a quality one like here.

I'm imagining something like Guitar Hero, but you have to hit the notes the instant they come onscreen and if you get a note wrong there's a 1:1,000,000 chance your Xbox catches on fire.


















I am trying to embed a Youtube video into https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/43251/best-way-to-import-analog-video-vhs-to-mac/43568#43568my answer, but I can't seem to get it to work.

It was just an idea…b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've run in to [one case](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46525/how-to-partially-uncover-bullet-points-in-keynote/46559#46559) in my time here where I thought an animation in the answer was useful.

The winner of the iPad raffle is https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/4160/steve-moserSteve Moser!

Great job everyone. Winners will be contacted over the next couple of days.



Apple recently announced the revamped and recharged iPad, and they hit stores today. This new iteration of Apple’s tablet features impressive quad core graphics, and state of the art Retina technology for higher def viewing. The new iPad continues to set the standard for elegance in design and advancements in performance and technology. 



We’re impressed. Are you?

In our corner of the Apple universe, we continue to build a comprehensive resource helping those who dare to ask different. To celebrate the new benchmark in tablet computing, we ordered a few for you, in case to you didn’t have the chance to.

Because we can’t give new iPads to everyone (we wish that we could!), people who participate on Ask Different during the next few weeks to different degrees earn different Apple products. Visit the Ask Different http://thenewipadishere.com/iPad Contest Page for specific details on how these iPads (and iPods) are being given away.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The new iPad is here - ask different and win one!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Although I most likely have a snowballs change in hell of even qualifying for it, what about people in countries where the iPad is not available yet? Will you agree to them covering the shipping cost if reasonable?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it's reasonably easy to ship it to you, yes we will work something out. Either we will ship it to you or you can buy it yourself and we can reimburse you. However, there are sometimes cases where it's very difficult or impossible to ship prizes to certain countries - if that happens to be the case we'll do our best to work with you and figure something else out. Can't make any promises though until we know the exact scenario.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You do realise that the dates on the competition rules aren't 3 weeks apart?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - sorry, we originally planned on having it last 3 weeks but then changed it to 2.5. The dates are correct.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lauren, the votes on questions, is that the combined up and down votes, or just the up? (basically what stops someone downvoting the others)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's the overall score - the combined up and down votes. We purposely want to take into account downvotes in order to keep the site high-quality. Downvoting is a way to let users know that their question isn't a good fit, and since promotions like this tend to bring in new users, we need to keep all the moderation tools available.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lauren thanks for the update. Who won the raffle?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@R.M Yes, W9s are required for iPod winners. See [this post](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/a/4396/16718) for why: "Whether or not the prize you just won in this contest is up to that amount, if you plan on participating on future promotions, it is simpler to collect the data now than to wait until it does become an issue."

Not that it matters, but I was just wondering...

I just got +3 reputation for an upvote. But I always thought an upvote is +10, no?

I did however offered a bounty of 50 reputation today... Maybe I reached my limit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, odd. Try looking at http://apple.stackexchange.com/reputation to get a second opinion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, then that would likely be the problem. There is a 200 reputation cap.

In general, up votes on answers are worth +10 and up votes on questions are worth +5. There are exceptions. There is a daily reputation cap of 200, and if you hit it at the time you were upvoted, you would only receive the score that brings your total up to 200.

If you got an upvote that would have brought you above 200 **before** you offered the bounty, your score would still be limited.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, thanks for your answer :)


















We have experimented with https://video.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/190/youtube-and-soundcloud-embedding-is-now-enabled/191#191embedded video on a few sites, but I would be very hesitant about enabling it widely unless the site can show a substantial need for it. 

One of the big problems with video is that it is not searchable. Remember that the lifeblood of this site is search, so every time a video replaces a well-worded post that describes the problem, you have that much less content on the site that can be searched. Videos are, essentially, a black box to the Internet — they break those mechanisms we rely on to bring people to this site.

Text is the primary means of communicating what we have here to the outside world. For every question or answer that is described "in video," that information becomes obscured behind a black curtain; One less opportunity for people to find the text that describes the solution.

I am really excited at how well worded and thought through this contest is. I appreciate the explanation about how the raffle will work and what might happen if more people qualify than prizes are available. I personally dislike open ended raffles where you don't know how long or how many items are intended to be offered as prizes and that cheapens the promotion in my opinion. In this case - having the status update as we ask/answer/share is really making this fun to track progress of everyone.

I have one question. Level one enters you in the raffle. Does level two get you a second entry in the same raffle or perhaps is there a second raffle for just the people that have Level two contributions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good question - there is only one raffle, which will include people who finish both Level 1 and Level 2. Level 2 does not get you a second entry into the raffle - the benefit of finishing Level 2 over Level 1 is that you get an iPod Touch.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good stuff - for clarity and as an advocate of Plain English, if you remove the comment about Raffle Entry from Level 2 it tightens everything up, because you cannot get to L2 without already having done L1 anyway, so the comment is redundant and leads to confusion evidenced by this question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's a good point. I don't want to change this one, because I can see people being confused and thinking we are no longer entering Level 2s into the raffle. But I'll work on making it clearer for next time.


















I think we should stay away from the options involving special characters. They're harder to type and some older computers/browsers may have trouble displaying them. A standard involving special characters would be hard to enforce simply because it's more work to type so people are less likely to use it.
I don't think that we should bold all menu paths. I like preserving bold for where emphasis is required. Using it in all menu paths would 'dilute' its meaning in the rest of the document, and it would make it impossible to emphasize a specific path.
Similarly, I think that the <code> formatting should be reserved for code or specific parameters.
That leaves the first, second, and third options. I would argue that they are all fine: they contain the same information and are equally clear and readable. I prefer the second and third options, but that's just a personal preference.
That said, I think that much of this comes down to personal choice. Like the phrasing of a post, the original poster's 'voice' and preferences should be preserved whenever possible.
I would say that menu path formatting that does not match the standard is not an acceptable reason for an edit. Even if you're editing a post already, I don't think that changing the menu path formatting should be done except in extreme cases (all menu items in code formatting, or some problematic option that we haven't even considered).
Short version:
I propose considering any of the first three options standard. But, don't edit other people's stuff to match the standard unless you've got a good reason.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can see absolutely no reason to enforce a standard on this. So long as the author makes his intentions clear, all is good. Personally, I like to put menu choices in Bold, and generally separate them using > (unless I can guide you to the menu using words).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed almost 100%, other than use of the  highlighting `is very useful` for differentiating what is prose in an answer, and what is meant to represent on screen text.  Given that this is not a programming Q&A, I have co-opted the code emphasis to mean "screen text" of any sort.  A such `File > Print` is cool with me.


















Wow, this looks great and very generous. However, I am curious about the asterisk: "What do you get? A new iPad*!" because I cannot find what that refers to.

In the event that more than the maximum number of people complete the Levels, the winners with the highest combined score on their contest posts will be chosen."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The asterisk should totally be on the bottom of the page  and not in that button nonsense.


















I see a contest progress panel on other users' profiles; some are empty, some not. My profile does not show one.  Do I have to do something to make it appear?

You could also just cast a vote. That'll make it appear (after a few minutes) and after all also is what makes the site work :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm, thought I had done some qualifying actions; I'll have to re-read the rules.

Apple has shown their cards on how all three generations of the iPad are documented with names when you need to tell them apart.

The official manual lists the iPad as iPad (3rd generation) in the http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/ipad_user_guide.pdfprinted / PDF user's guide. This is the primary consumer facing naming convention since many products get "the new" treatment launch in printed, media, advertising and web sales. At some point "the new" goes away and we are left with the canonical names.

When you browse the store for iPad docks, the http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC360ZM/AMC360ZM/A dock lists compatibility with the iPad 1st generation and the http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC940ZM/AMC940ZM/A dock with the iPad 2 2nd generation and iPad 3rd generation.



To complicate things (it can never be too easy, can it?), http://support.apple.com/manuals/#ipadApple's support web site for manuals changes this terminology a bit. If you are logged in with an Apple ID and browse a few manuals - both the general ones that address iOS 5.1 on the new iPads and specific ones that address radio spectrum power testing and regulatory compliance - you will build up a slightly different list of iPads - akin to the sales names when you buy them from the online store and names need to differentiate between colors, carriers, and 3G/4G radio capabilities.





Now as to what makes sense here, I see two alternatives - the first being do we try to set precedent and use iPad for all general questions as well as for the current device. The downside there is some re-tagging will be needed and some user confusion will ensue. The benefit is one big tag to keep things together and make people with tag reputation goals and badges more likely to arise (by not segmenting the iPad questions). The other alternative is to leave iPad alone and general and to make up a tag for each model as needed. We can use synonyms to group things (say some use of iPad 2 (2nd generation) WiFi + 3G (Verizon) might be better pointing to iPad 2). This will also have some retagging when people don't tag correctly and some user confusion (but different users will be confused here).

Regardless - it looks like we'll need a tag structure something like:


iPad
iPad (1st generation)
iPad 2 or iPad 2 (2nd generation)
iPad (3rd generation)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about iPad (X generation) for each generation? "iPad 2 (2nd generation)" just sounds and looks awkward to meb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the purpose of tagging I feel that "generation" is unnecessary and maintain that iPad-1, iPad-2, etc. will do the job. I'm also rapidly falling into the camp that wonders if we need to make tag distinctions at this time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For tags, perhaps iPad-1-gen iPad-2-gen and iPad-3-gen ?


















I advocate splitting product names and generations into seperate tag.  iPad Gen3 is absolutely clear to me, and the only downside would be having Gen3 applicable to multiple products but I don't see that as a large issue as no-one will ever search on a tag like that independently without providing scope via a product name.

It depends on how you see Tags as fitting.  Are they for searching, or for categorising for the purpose of trending in profiles?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The general SE position is that each tag should be able to stand alone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, but not all SE subsites have the same requirments at all, and this one probably has the most difficult tag profile to manage, so some local tweaking shouldn't be overlooked purely on the basis of strict consistency to a position that isn't necessarily even agreed policy, just received wisdom.


















I think the promotion is a good thing, and I am calling it a promotion rather than a competition because the competetive element is potentially a bad thing here.  However I have a few misgivings about the format:

"Realtime Updates" - This is some really great code, but it's intended purpose has a dark side, and knowing you are X shares away from getting Level 2 etc will just prompt some people to flood their communications channels with links because they know they are close.  Check chat for the reduced number of onebox links and the increase in the personalised links.  I've done this myself, and am not proud.  The fact you can check on the other guys too means you can get too involved trying to beat the others, rather than put out genuine content that would be welcome even without a promotion.  If the idea is to promote being a good citizen, then the winning citizen by definition would have done it anyway, and shouldn't be doing it merely because there's a prize.  Removing the update would potentially stop borderline genuine users from caning the site for 3 weeks then leaving because they won't have a clue if they are caning it in vain or not, whereas a "better" user will carry on regardless.

"New Users" - Obviously you had a brief when setting this competition up, and you will know what your expected outcomes are and what you wanted to achieve.  No way to know exactly what these things were, but what we seem to have is an influx of people (some new, some previously dormant) throwing up a lot of content.  The "acheivements" for want of a better word for getting X answers voted on etc reward quantity without necessarily have any controls of the quality.  If I ruled the world (in my lovely hat) I would like to see the promotion be more tailored to getting people to use the site properly, rather than to use it lots; this should foster the same end result inadvertently anyway.  I know this is difficult, but helpful flags and other badges may be a good way of getting the existing audience to use the site better, which should in turn equate to more at the same time.

"Tactical voting" - I'm not saying this has happened, but I am saying when the time comes close to the end, it likely will happen.  Someone with the required 4x6 upvotes will find one get's mysteriously downvoted to 5 votes and rules them out of Level 3.  I'm raising this now so you are prepared for it, I know votes are supposed to be invisible, but you will for sure get a query I feel.  That's not me saying I will do it of course, but it's human nature when a big prize is at stake.  And there's the other side too, people not voting for someone who is close to moving up a level in the competition etc as a way to maintain a gap in the scoring.

"Shares" - I've tried to share and point out exactly why I am doing it.  Each time I have put shares out on Twitter I have book ended it with non share tweets about AD and the promotion.  I don't want to link bait my friends, but I do want to turn some of them into users here.  As I mentioned previously, I'm sure a lot of the shares are actually being shared in chat where discussion is pretty busy at the moment.  These shares defeat the intended purpose, as they never leave the site, and are only ever seen by existing users.  Perhaps a better mechanism is to allow a referal scheme  in a future competition.  Having a challenge to introduce 2 new users who get say 250 Rep and 5 selected badges within a month of joining would actually be a way to ensure higher quality inrease in visits that results in tangible benefits.

As I have other thoughts, I may edit them in here.  Overall I am 70% positive on the promotion.  I hope it acheives it's aims, and of course I hope I win an iPad, and further still if I do, I hope I deserved to win on the basis of maintaining very active but more importantly very focussed input to the sites real aims which still stand apart as worthwhile content.  I'll still be here after, as I was here before.  This is not an "old guard" (I've only been here what 7 months?) piece of disgruntlement against new users though, I hope that the conversion or "sticky" ratio of the more recently active users is increased post promotion.  I would hate to see someone with enough free time simple hammer the site for 3 weeks and then hit the sunset with iPad in hand.

The suspension period ends in 6 days`, I do hope this is addressed formally, I note that the suspension period still allows the entrant who is close to Level 3 a further week to complete the challenge, and although his profile scores seem reset to "1 Rep" the competition entries still seem valid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I responded to some of your comments below. I think the "challenge to bring in new 250-rep users" idea is interesting. Will mull it over and see if it's doable. Thanks!


















Thank you for posting this. This is almost exactly how I feel, and part of my convo in the chat last night.

I thought about it a little more, and think in some cases, we can even use the current tools and voting to almost regulate it. As in, if a user is just doing 'jeopardy' questions, we should vote accordingly. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As loathe as I am to admit it, there's nothing wrong with *some* Jeopardy questions. It's all about the quality of the question. A relentless stream of Jeopardy questions of questionable value is a sign of someone gaming the system. A few Jeopardy questions as a part of otherwise healthy activity isn't a bad thing. As you say, if a user is **just** doing Jeopardy questions, we should vote accordingly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Exactly, sorry if my answer didn't come across as that way. Im OK with them, just needs to be monitored.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we're agreeing with each other :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's tricky.  What if they are *just* doign Jepardy questions, but they all when taken independently are acceptable?  We should't really act on them any differently, much as we might not like the direction and the intention.  It's tricky.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the community as a whole can help manage it. As in, 'you see it when you see it' kind of thing.


















Thanks for posting this, it definitely warrants a discussion. 

Whenever we run a promotion, the goal (in addition to rewarding you for all the hard work you do) is to increase activity on the site by attracting new users or getting current users more engaged. Anything that increases activity carries some risk that the site will see an increase in lower-quality content. Because of that, we always try to run promotions past the moderators to get feedback, and we only run large promotions like this on sites that have a community strong enough to moderate a large influx of content.

In this case, we designed the promotion a little differently than past promotions because we thought it would be more interesting, less competitive, and have better results. Our past promotions were mostly tag contests, where we'd pick a tag and a timeframe and give prizes to the top or most viewed posts. The drawback with that kind of promotion is there can only be 1 or 2 winners, so it causes more competition. Although there are limits to the number of people that can win iPads and iPods in this contest, it's pretty high. That doesn't mean it eliminates all competition, but it does mean that you can cheer people on and vote for their posts without dramatically decreasing your own chances of winning. Because of that, our hope was that people would still be willing to vote other posts up or down when appropriate, as per usual, without concern for whether it would affect their own status in the contest.

The real-time updates were meant to make the promotion more interesting to watch and increase the likelihood that people would participate. It just makes it easier to keep track of things that you can mostly find anyway. Since it’s easy to see where you are, we figured it would make people more likely to come back and try to reach that next level. I see stuffe’s point that it might cause people to flood their communication channels - we tried to reduce this by allowing you to share posts anywhere you want instead of just your own Facebook and Twitter.

This is not a perfect promotion, so I appreciate the discussion and feedback. To some extent, there’s no way to avoid a little bit of competition when prizes are involved. My hope is that most people are on the site because they love Apple and find the Q&A helpful and interesting. The bar for winning this contest is set pretty high, which I think keeps out most people who are just here to win an iPad. Those people will always be around, but we're doing our best to reduce the damage they might do.

Though my own comments (mostly in the chat room) may paint me as a critic of this contest, I am appreciative of the work that you do and of the effort to expand and grow the AD community. We'll survive this. But it will present some challenges.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good reply.  I guess the leap from unspecified T-Shirt style swag to a damn large haul of Apple hardware was a big jump and the site is taking time to adjust.  Competition is good, until people take it too seriously.  The guy who was suspended just made me want to shout "This is why we can't have nice things!" at the internet ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe I get so excited about the idea of winning T-shirts or virtual badges that it didn't occur to me that "a damn large haul of Apple hardware" would get more people excited. :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe yeah, it always sucks when one person does something that could ruin it for everyone else. Fortunately, we do have tools to track suspicious voting behavior like that.


















I want to expand on my comment to https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1200/Lauren.

Some of my remarks in the chat room of late might be interpreted to mean that I'm against the this contest. This is not true. I am very appreciative of the efforts that Lauren (and whomever else is deserving) put into creating and promoting the contest. I am thankful to Stack Exchange for committing the resources necessary to provide killer prizes like iPads and iPod Touchs. I am hopeful that the exposure that the contest brings will bring new growth and excitement to Ask Different.

I am especially hopeful that a few members of our community who have put forth extraordinary efforts, particularly in the area of providing high quality answers, will be rewarded for their efforts. I know it wasn't the lure of an iPad that motivated them to begin with, but that doesn't mean they can't be rewarded after the fact. And should I be fortunate enough to receive a prize, I won't turn it down. There is a lot of good in this contest and it has brought a lot of life to Ask Different.

What I am against is the effect that the contest is having on our community.  New faces are popping up and posting without taking the time to learn what Ask Different is all about. Previously dormant users are rising up and posting multiple questions for which answers are a simple RTFM (or Google search) away. Even some of our long time members are posting questions about which I harbor doubts. Is it a real question? Will an answer actually make a difference? Does the OP really care or is this just to put some points on the scoreboard? The quality that we fight hard to maintain is being eroded and there is something distasteful about the edge that competition brings to our site.

I know that we have the tools do deal with all of these challenges but at times I feel like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_FuryNick Fury battling http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HYDRAHYDRA; Cut off an arm and another grows to take its place.

The bottom line is that hanging out on Ask Different has been less pleasant of late. Ironic since my numbers would seemingly indicate I'm spending more time here. Perhaps that's true, but it's just not as enjoyable as it was last week.

As I said to Lauren, this will pass. We'll survive and by discussing our grievances and, most importantly by virtue of business as usual—asking, answering, commenting and voting—we'll emerge a stronger community in the end. Despite the sense of impending doom I may express in my darker moments. 



A special shout-out and thanks to Bmike and Kyle Cronin, who have both talked me down off the ledge this week and to Stuffe and Daniel L for keeping it real for me. You are the best amongst the best. We may disagree on specifics from time to time, but in the end I know we share a common goal.

As @balpha, the coder of the contest has http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3910467#3910467said:


  Once a mission is completed, it won't be revoked automatically if the criteria aren't met anymore. We can revoke them manually, but we'll only do that if the mission was achieved only because of serial upvoting or similar issues, but not just because some downvote got you below the threshold again. Chances are that another upvote is going to come in anyway :)

This doesn't answer the "why", but it should be of interest.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is the correct answer.  We'll not revoke levels that were attained if the criteria are no longer met due to score fluctuations.


















If you want to track clicks, you could use a service like https://bitly.com/bitly. They tell you how many times it was clicked, when it was clicked, etc.

I was hoping this information could be made available via some stack exchange interface.  It would solve the problem though...


















It's not so clear from the contest rules:


  We can give away a maximum of 25 iPod touch devices and a maximum of 6 new iPads (5 for Level 3, and 1 for the raffle). In the event that more than the maximum number of people complete the Levels, the winners with the highest combined score on their contest posts will be chosen.


So will Level 3 winners who don't get an iPad be moved down to Level 2? Or will they only be entered in the raffle?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If there are 6 winners in Level 3, will the one ranked 6 win an iPod?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My thinking on this is the other way. You can't get to level 3 without first passing level two. According to this [answer and comment](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/1188/5472) You don't get any extra entries in the raffle - so making it to level 3 and not winning shouldn't affect your odds on winning the raffle. We'll have to wait for the employees that are running the promotion to answer definitively and I'll mention it to them on Monday as I hope they don't work on weekends.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question is closed since the relevant promotion is over and that code inactive.

If there are 6 winners in level three, then all six are also in level 2. But since each user is only eligible for one prize, and you get the prize for the highest level you complete, then the top five in level 3 will get ipads, and then the top 25 in level two - minus the 5 that already received the ipad - will get ipod touches.  Everyone in level 2 that didn't get an ipod would then be eligible for the drawing in level one.


  Each user is only eligible for one prize. You earn the prize for the highest level you complete.


Given the rate that level two is expanding since Wednesday when I started, I expect there will be more than 25 users in that group, and more than 5 users in level 3.

Once you make it into level 2 or 3, you will have to keep working to stay in the top 25 and top 5 respectively to actually get the prize.

Note I'm note a contest organizer or official, but this is my interpretation of the rules.  Would be nice to have Stack Exchange confirm this...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are now 29 people in level 1.  Assuming everyone keeps moving forward at the pace they're moving, then only people who move faster than someone in level 1 is going to get anything except the raffle.  In other words, the top 30 people who will receive ipads and ipods are probably mostly on the winners page right now, and anyone wanting to get one, aside from the drawing, needs to beat one of them to the top, and stay ahead of them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, the mods aren't contest organizers or officials here, so our interpretation is also just speculation. What you need is a higher level still: Stack Exchange employeesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielL Ah yes, that's true.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AdamDavis: Thanks, Adam. Your answer makes sense, especially [since users in higher levels are duplicated in the lower ones](http://thenewipadishere.com/).


















They appear when that chatroom screen has lost focus at the last message you read before going to another program or chatroom.  When you come back, the line shows you where you left off reading so you don't have to figure out what was said while you were doing something else.

This is intentional, the image is an iPad partially hiding behind the question view. If you click on the iPad you'll see that we're currently holding a contest, where the top contributors can earn iPads.

I still say that that is completely non-obvious.  Is that the criteria for being in the competition - can you spot that it's an iPad?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewStacey I'll admit that it does look like some sort of layout or formatting error to someone that doesn't recognize it, but I imagine most Apple fans will. If I were designing it I might have gone for something slightly different, but I think that it mostly does the jobb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, now that I know what it is then I recognise it.  I think it might have been better to go for a black iPad just because the main site is so white-dominated as it is.  I was really just trying to find out if there was something hidden that I wasn't seeing.  From what you say, I conclude that there isn't and so I'll stop worrying about it.  Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewStacey We tried a black one first; it was way too harsh on the eyes (because of the extreme contrast with the rest of the site).


















Your question is a perfect example of a question that is closed to make it better so it can be reopened.  

Two things conspired to have me flag two of your questions for another moderator to review.


You asked 7 questions in a 10 hour period - most of which were decent, but two seemed bad fits for our Q&A site.
The one that Daniel closed after agreeing with my flag and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45749/is-the-ios-homescreen-bug-a-bug-or-a-featurethis one


Would you read over the FAQ for the main site on why questions that are a simple yes/no are less desirable (it's in the guide to good subjective / bad subjective) and we want to optimize for questions that have long answers and explain why an answer is yes or no. Please pay attention to the concept of shared space on the home page and drives away attention from other's questions. 

Did you read my comment and think about refining the question? Have you done any research how blocking might occur so that someone who knows the answer can decide how best to explain the reality of why a message may or may not get blocked?

Your question here is a good way to start getting feedback, but I would recommend linking the question in the chat room to see if you can get some help from the user base. The users can and will help edit, vote to close or reopen and I'll gladly take a look as soon as its edited to see if it should've reopened. 

We will actively close off questions of marginal use to the site just to keep the home page balanced. We want a mix of easy, hard, answered and not answered so sometimes it's bad timing for a marginal question. The good news is close isn't a permanent thing - there will usually be specific feedback as well as this meta to get more info on why / how.

Would you take a pass at either simplifying the question or explaining the research you have done and where your roadblock lies in understanding the iChat blocking idea? An alternate method would be to ask on chat for people to help edit it and/or vote to reopen as is. The community at large can also help on this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure. I asked it on chat, and now I can see your reason for flagging it, even if I disagree with your reasoning. I have done some research on the blocking, but I have not found much. Thus the question. I'll try to get the question fixed and reopened ASAP.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome - the biggest fix would be to remove the joke link and perhaps ask more broadly how chat could be filtered and not whether iChat or apple is doing the filtering.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that the "joke link" is credible enough. Imagine if a user on SO had the name "Charlie Sheen". Plus, it doesn't seem as bad as some other Y! answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Stack Exchange has a policy of _explicitly banning_ accounts that impersonate another in name or likeness so I'm not sure if your example holds much water. We aim to be the best Q&A site on the internet which is why people have reputation and moderators are elected and empowered to ask that some questions get improved from time to time. :-) :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yeah, I guess Charlie Sheen might not exist *here*. But still: I've seen some funny names around here. See the Many Memes of Meta question.


















In the http://thenewipadishere.com/New iPad Contest, the rules state:


  We can give away a maximum of 25 iPod touch devices and a maximum of 6 new iPads (5 for Level 3, and 1 for the raffle). In the event that more than the maximum number of people complete the Levels, the winners with the highest combined score on their contest posts will be chosen.


Should more than five users complete Level 3 (a possibility looking more and more likely, despite my prediction that we'd be lucky if a grand total of two people completed the challenge!), how exactly are winners chosen? It says "highest combined score on their contest posts", but which posts are contest posts for Level 3 purposes? The first 35 questions asked during the contest? The highest scoring 35 questions asked during the contest? All not closed, not deleted questions and answers from the contest time period?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How, exactly, would winners be determined if more than five users complete Level 3?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd add to this question: if someone is not in the top 5 of Level 3, are they guaranteed to get an iPod? That is, are they ranked along with the Level 2-ers? / Is it possible that someone in Level 3 has less total score on "contest posts" than people in Level 2, and thus wins nothing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They've already committed to $8,000 worth of prizes ($5,000 for 25 ipods, $3,000 for 6 ipads) but I'm secretly hoping that since the contest obviously exceeded their expectations, they might exceed the contestants expectations and increase the prizes (number of prizes/winners, or new level with higher end ipads or laptops), though that's probably unlikely.  Still, I'm about to hit level two and I suspect I'm going to have to hit level three just to get an ipod.  I've pretty much written off the ipads since at best I might be 16th to 20th place overall.  I can't catch up to the leaders now...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm curious if, for any reason, bounties would not be considered as part of the "highest combined score".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a related question [here](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1211/if-there-are-6-winners-in-level-3-will-the-one-ranked-6-win-an-ipod) where I left an answer that should clarify your questions. Let me know if it doesn't. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lauren: what are your thoughts on Adam's point below? "It may be that latecomers will have somewhat of an advantage by spending more time crafting questions and answers that will be more highly scored for their entries than those who have already reached a given level and locked in their contest entries with generic questions and answers."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's an interesting thought. I think people who post early also have an advantage though, because their posts will be up longer and have more opportunities to be voted on. These rules weren't meant to encourage or discourage people from posting early or later, they're just there for tie-breaking purposes if necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question is closed since the relevant promotion is over and that code inactive.


















Those two links will do the same thing. The part that tracks who shared the link is your user ID at the end of the link (3117 for you).

The ?stw=1 at the end is so that Stack Exchange can track which links were posted using the sharing buttons. It doesn't effect the performance of the link.

Both links are equivalent and will count towards badges and contest shares.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is correct - thanks for clarifying Nathan.


















When a post gets a score of -3, it means that three different people have voted against it. Downvoting is rather rare on this site; if three different people make a point of voting against a post, it is certainly not the work of a single "cyber-criminal"; it is the community speaking that a particular post does not belong here.

I speak from experience here: a post of mine got three downvotes earlier this week. While I liked the post, I deleted it; the community had spoken.

If someone votes against a person's posts to go after that person, that is indeed bad for the site. Voting should be about the post, and not about who posted it. But receiving widespread downvotes from many members of the site is the opposite of "cyber-criminal" -- it is how the site works. If a post gets downvotes from a range of voters, don't ask what's wrong with the voters; ask yourself what is wrong with the post. If you ask others for help understanding this and people try to explain, don't argue with them; listen.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you're deleting posts *frequently*, something's already broken. Deleting unwanted posts is a way to clean up after a problem, but better still to prevent the problem by figuring out what posts *do* belong here *before* posting, particularly before posting 14 questions in two days.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I realized that that's a bad thing; I'm reading as many *good* questions here as I can to see what's considered a good question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JavaAndCSharp That's wonderful!


















Here's a quick question (3 atually) on the contest:  Let's assume I win an iPad (Yay me!):


Do I get a colour choice?
What if I already have one, can I request something of equivalent value, maybe Apple Vouchers?
What if I want a 32Gb one, can I pay the difference?


Thanks!

As for color choice, all the iPads we've ordered are black.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lucky I want a black one!  I would prefer a 32Gb one, but on the off chance that I do win, I will likely simply return it to store imediately and offer to trade up! :)  Thanks for replying.


















Yes, if there are more than 5 people in Level 3, the others will get iPod Touches. They will also be entered into the raffle.

To figure out who the "top 5" are, we'll look at the posts you made for the contest and figure out the total combined score (so if all 35 of your posts had a score of 6, your combined score would be 35*6 = 210). The 5 who have the highest combined score will get an iPad.

Sorry it wasn't clear before. Make sense now? 

Edit: I've been told some people still have questions, so just to clarify - this is the score that your contest posts have. It's not your reputation or the votes you have cast, only the score on the posts that you have made.

The posts that will count for the tie breaker are the highest-scored posts you made during the contest. For Level 2 that will be the top 20 posts and for Level 3 that will be the top 35 posts (excluding deleted posts, closed questions, and answers to closed questions).

Just a thought, but you could take the money you were going to spend on those 25 iPod touch devices and spend them on additional iPads for level 3...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alternately, put any unclaimed prizes from the higher levels into a drawing for the first level, where everyone is eligible if they haven't received a higher prize.  But I don't think that will be necessary, I'm pretty sure well get 30+ people in the second level, and 5+ in the third.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good suggestions. Don't think I should change the rules for this one, but I'll keep them in mind for future promotions. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lauren- Appreciate you are probably bored of this, but it keeps cropping up in Chat still.  For the removal of any ambiguity, can you please define "contest posts" as "The first 4/20/35 qualifying questions/answers" or as some other definition.  Thanks! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe see my edit. Hope that clears it up!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you very much :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@balpha Re: your edit, does “during the contest” mean “as long as the contest runs”? So people who finished level 3 already can still make new posts, and if these posts get enough votes, they’d count towards their score (if the score happens to be in the user’s top 35 of all posts between Friday 3/16/2012 and Monday 4/2/2012)? Woah.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mathias Sure, why would an awesome answer that you post today not count? That would essentially punish you for finishing the mission early.


















Lauren, part of the community development/evangelism team (CHAOS) at Stack Exchange that is running this contest, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1227/219posted the following clarification:

It would be interesting as a single point for data, but it wouldn't be that helpful unless it was updated daily for the full next week.  

Besides, those that are really interested in playing the game can just go to each competitor's user page and do the work by hand.

I'm interested in seeing the slope of each's reputation, since that's what will matter by the end of the contest, as both level 2 and 3 will have more winners than prizes.

On the other hand, the stack exchange API would be able to provide that information for the interested programmer...

Your slope is steeper than mine, so as long as you get your act together and start sharing links, you'll be more likely to get an ipad than I will.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pretty much this. Using the API would be your best bet for up-to-date information.


















Here's a great example of tactical voting: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/46171/3117https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/46171/3117

Downvote, no comment, although my answer is 100% correct and was posted before any other answer was visible.

I have a very good idea who is responsible and of course it is another person close to reaching level 3. I don't expect any action taken except to note that this is happening and I expect it will only become more common in the next week or so.

You did post a one-sentence answer, without sources or explanation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have only seen [one of my answers downvoted](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/46218/219) but honestly I'm not worried.  I never downvote, so no one has to worry about negative tactical voting from me.  I'm not voting very much at all, in fact. I've received so few downvotes since the beginning of the contest, though, that I'm honestly not worried about it.  I've received well over 100 upvotes since the beginning of the contest, and 2-3 downvotes is really nothing to worry about.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I find the actual *question* here tricky, because the one asking could have done a simple Google search to determine this on their own in less time than it took to ask. While your answer is 100% correct, the question (to me) is of very low quality.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't accept that. Unnecessary words or references for something so simple and unequivocally correct makes it better how?

Post the link to your "link" button for the question and we will likely see the /5472 identifies me as the sharer where your user number will be different. The part before that resolves to the question itself with no credit to anyone for sharing.

What does your testing show?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, fine, but now I have a second question: Does using the Facebook, Twitter or Google + buttons on a question's page count as a "share" according to the contest rules?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@WheatWilliams Yes, as long as five other people click on your link.  Then that link will count as one shared link for the purposes of the contest.  I've been sharing them with another forum I visit, and on twitter.  I know others are using facebook and g+.  The key point is that you have to use your special URL with your usernumber at the end, and get 5 other people to click on it for each share you want to complete.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@WheatWilliams You'll find that sending links for the very popular poll style questions, like best ipad and iphone apps, and for questions involving newly released products, like the new ipad, or even thunderbolt info, will yield many more clicks than generic question.  Further, many people will actually be interested in that information, rather than feel like you're spamming them just to win a contest.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a whole new realm for me. I've been active on Ask Different and elsewhere on StackExchange for seven months, but I have never "shared" anything outside of this site, or posted about anything on this site anywhere else. I suppose that's one of the purposes of the contest--to get people making posts about Ask Different elsewhere. To be honest with you, the idea of "sharing a post" from Ask Different has never occurred to me before.


















Here’s a screenshot from https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/3117/adam-eberbachAdam Eberbach’s profile (not that it matters who it’s from — this is just so you can reproduce the issue):



Note that it says “19/20 shares”, even though level 3 is 100% complete. I assume that after completion of level 3, one of the questions/answers Adam shared got deleted or closed. Apparently, this has the side effect of not counting towards the total share count anymore.

Is this a bug or a feature?

And, by extension, if contest questions/answers are deleted/closed, will the votes they gained still be considered in the final count, or not?

Update: To clarify, I know https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1205/4408completed missions won’t be revoked — I’m just wondering what happens to the total score when one of the questions/answers gets deleted/closed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Possible bug in the contest share countb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, I was just about to ask about this too. I think it is because someone closed one of my questions after it was shared. But someone who can look at the stats can probably say for sure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the intent of the employees chat message wasn't necessarily that a mission will not get revoked, just that one solitary down vote (aka vote fluctuation) wasn't going to get someone removed.  The community closing a question is far more of a signal that you should keep trying to complete the contest than a single down vote from where I see things... I'll ping Lauren tomorrow to see what the contest runners have to say about this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question is closed since the relevant promotion is over and that code inactive.


















Firstly, I do think the current competition is brilliant, and actively wanted to participate, however I stopped for 2 specific reasons.


Since the start of the competition, an incredible amount of low quality questions has been asked, and in some cases, just the rate at which some users ask questions, it clearly showed it was only being asked to gain votes for the competition.
Copy and paste of duplicate answer, just to train and gain votes. I have no objection to answer posted at the same time, but like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46471/how-can-i-do-a-dictionary-look-up-without-the-trackpadthis example, a fairly high rep users posted a duplicate of my answer, sole difference with a screenshot, 2 minutes after mine. To what end?
I have also noticed a the rate of voting has actively dropped. Which is the opposite of what the competition is trying to encourage.


I find these type of situation extremely demotivating, especially since the bulk of these users generally disappear once the competition is over, and secondly, it becomes a rude game of having to improve an answer for no reason just to try and get a legitimate vote.

The issue for me is not with new users, since they still need to learn the system, however watching established, long term and fairly decent reputation holding users of this site specifically, post some of the most over the top questions, or actively duplicating answers, is really disappointing to see.

I've also seen incidents of users asking for reputation, and other unacceptable methods to try and gain extra votes. 

Is this truly the purpose or behaviour SE wants for it's sites? 

Please note, there is some users that I am very glad to see in Level 2 and Level 3 that deserve it, and in one or two cases I actively tried to find content to upvote to help them closer to the prize. My issue however is with the percentage of users that will win using some unacceptable methods, leaving some real potential winners demotivated. Also, personally, if there was a way from opting out of the competition, I would, since I am not interested in any prize, either way.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does the current competition bring out the worst in users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5related: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1197/how-do-we-keep-the-exciting-promotion-from-reducing-the-quality-of-the-siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin I should have searched. Do you want to close this as a duplicate? Or should I just delete it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you feel it's a duplicate, you can delete and post an answer on the originalb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin I am not entirely sure, they are related. I will leave it to the community to decide if they consider it a duplicate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To address one of your points: "I have also noticed a the rate of voting has actively dropped." This is not true. The amount of new posts has roughly doubled since the contest started; the amount of voting has increased by about ~150% (IOW more than doubled). So on average, a post is voted on 25% more often than previously.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@balpha Fair enough. I was going on the perception I have comparing the current voting to previous voting, however I had no statistics to back up the claim.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An interesting tactic was used today.  9 hours after a question was posted, and I received 10 votes on an answer, the current leading winner of the competition started a close as duplicate vote on the question, which was joined by at least one other participant.  It is a valid close (though I wish it were merged, rather than closed), but it makes me wonder if I should spend some time looking hard at the leader's highest voted posts and see if they are duplicates, and flagging if they are.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do want people to understand that I'm not unhappy about this (and no, I'm not going to go around flagging dupes).  It's just an interesting *possible* issue to be considered for future contests. (I've already given up on the iPad - 40+ upvotes over a weekend is just not gonna happen for me...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The back story on the dupe: I'd started my answer on an iPad, then decided I wanted a screen shot and moved downstairs to my desk, logged in, cleaned desktop, created screenshot,  etc. Never received notice that an answer had been posted–though that notice *was* on my iPad when I returned to it several hours later. Left my answer as an *experiment* in the power of screenshots. An experiment that didn't prove the hypothesis in this case. Regardless, my answer is retracted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jaberg My apologies, I didn't mean to pick on you specifically and do regret that decision. It was more a case of it happening often then that particular scenario, and I made the mistake of highlighting the instance, which I shouldn't have.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just came across this - sorry for the delayed response. I tried to address most of these concerns [here](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/1200/13125) (same question Kyle linked to). If you have suggestions for how to improve contest format I'd love to hear them. Unfortunately, it seems like any promotion that increases content will just require more community attention to moderate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5proving your own point.


















These thoughts and more have been actively discussed in Chat for over a week now, so drop in any time if you want to discuss anything further.  Many people are in agreement in many ways, you'll see who by looking at Chat or the existing Meta questions and answers.

I think that you chose an unfortunate example to prove your point, as adding a screenshot can take added time which makes the question take longer to complete.  But I see that the slightest hint of impropriety has got peoples backs up, and there's no reason why you should react any differently.  However, it can be a coincidence, and I myself have come across the exact same scenario https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46077/how-to-use-the-new-ipad-3rd-gen-as-a-second-screen/46080#46080on this question although I know it to be completely innocent.  Somewhere in Chat this is discussed, and more than once I have suggested that when you get the "another answer has been posted" you should just ignore it and carry on with your own.

Also, full disclosure and all, it's just not something @Jaberg would actually do purposefully, and to be frank he has been one of the harshest critics of the competition for the exact same reasons as you - you'd get along well ;)

I've commented on multiple questions today and have noticed that my comments were deleted.  Unlike closed questions, deleted comments (at least from my privilege level) don't leave a trace.

This is as intended. As I've previously said (you've linked to the quote), once you've finished a mission, we will not revoke that mission again unless the mission has been accomplished by … less-than-fair means.

The contest site has a (dev-only) list of those users who have accomplished a mission, but according to current stats would not qualify. I look at that list at least once a day to check on it (it currently lists two users, Adam and one Mission 1 winner), and neither of these cases look irregular. So there's no reason to revoke these missions; at some point, the objectives where fulfilled, and thus the mission accomplished.

The profile widget shows a full bar (100%) if the mission is completed, but it doesn't lie about the stats. To be precise (and to comment on speculations about rounding errors), the percentage is deliberately designed to be at 100% if and only if the mission is completed. Having achieved 99.8% of a mission is still 99%, and having achieved a mission but not matching the stats anymore still puts you at 100%.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And how will this influence the total score? “In the event that more than the maximum number of people complete the Levels, the winners with the highest combined score on their contest posts will be chosen.” Will votes on deleted/closed posts count towards the total score or not?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MathiasBynens This particular case doesn't really influence the tie breaker, since it's about the "shared posts" count. But no, they wouldn't count; the tie breaker (for Mission 3) will be the sum of the top 35 scores of non-closed, non-deleted posts (in case of answers, those on non-closed questions) that have a score of 2+. This will be counted at the time the contest ends.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So there will always be 35 posts that count towards the total score, i.e., if one post that helped a user gain a level got deleted/closed, another one that was posted during the contest will be used instead, even if that one didn’t affect the level rankings. Right? (I’m asking ’cause I have [such a question myself](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/45644/4408).)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, all that counts is a) the post's score *at the time the contest ends* and b) the elegibility of that post (i.e. posted during the contest time and non-closed [again, at the time the contest ends] etc.) It doesn't matter whether that post already existed at the time you completed the mission.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for clarifying :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@balpha I got a string of up votes at 9:22 UTC, which will most likely be cleaned up by the script. Will that put me below Level2? Since I've capped for the day, I can't even tell if I'm moving up or down in votes on old posts. It's also probably too late for me to catch up to what damage the up votes might cause. Could you let me know what will happen?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@R.M Yeah, those votes have been invalidated. Note though that these votes will *not* have caused any harm for you, at all. Everything will just be like they never happened in the first place. Which indeed unfortunately includes completing mission 2 :\b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@balpha That indeed is the "harm" I was talking about ;) Thanks for the response



















  Since the start of the competition, an incredible amount of low quality questions has been asked


I think some examples are in order.  Yes, we've got more questions, but are they truly low quality?  


  in some cases, just the rate at which some users ask questions, it clearly showed it was only being asked to gain votes for the competition.


Well, that was one of the main goals of the competition, to generate new content and expand the knowledge base.  I don't think that this point is a bad thing, unless the additional content has a negative effect, as your first point suggests.


  Copy and paste of duplicate answer, just to train and gain votes. 


I've seen duplicate answers, but in each case I saw that they were added within minutes of each other, and since it takes me more than a few minutes to write a post then I see it simply as two people with essentially the same answer.

What I have noticed is that once people see their answer is duplicate, often they'll delete their own unless it's substantially better than the other answer.  This isn't happening here, and while it's not ideal, it's not a bad thing - it's just duplicate information.

balpha gave enough information to show that voting was actually up, so I don't think that's an issue anymore.

So the only issue remaining is whether the new posts are low quality or not.

It has been my experience that a community won't shy away from downvoting low quality posts, and yet I've seen very few questions and answers downvoted.  Either the whole community is accepting them, generally (and it's a big community) or people are being nice to avoid angering people for the contest.

I think this can only be resolved if you bring 5-10 examples of such posts here so we can discuss their merit.

For my part, I have been asking questions I wouldn't normally ask. Many of them could be discovered with 20-30 minutes of research on my part.  However that doesn't make them a bad question, to my way of thinking.  Since only one of my questions was downvoted, I'm assuming the community is fine with them.

I'd suggest people start downvoting and commenting on low quality questions.  If it's a serious problem that needs to be cleaned up, get the community active in calling people out on it.

I'm reminded of the early days of Stack Overflow.  We had a lot of relatively simple questions, but there were two surprising outcomes:


We became the canonical reference from google, and those questions, as simple as they are, draw in thousands of users trying to figure them out themselves.
We found that sometimes the simple questions had interesting complex answers, and once you got past the surface layer they revealed complexity in subjects many people take for granted.


I don't know that either will apply here, but I wouldn't encourage people to treat simple questions as low quality, and to answer them seriously rather than via simple google search.  Even experts might be surprised at what they find when they dig deep into a seemingly simple question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to admit, though, I feel *almost* bad about asking for recommendations here.  They are anathema on all the other SE sites I visit, and I feel like I'm taking advantage of a loophole because they are explicitly allowed here.  Still, I've learned a lot from my recommendation questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anecdotally I am in agreement with the low quality thing by and large.  But I feel that bringing examples to the table is not possible without implicit criticism of the participant, which is an area I feel should remain untrod.


















You could use a link shortener to link to the x-man-page URLs, like so:

http://is.gd/kP7w5ax-man-page://8/fsck_cs
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting, thanks, but the workaround fails in some browsers …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GrahamPerrin It works for me in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. What browsers does it not work in?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[OmniWeb](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omniweb/) 5.11.1 ([pictured](http://www.wuala.com/grahamperrin/public/2012/04/01/b/?mode=gallery)) treats http://is.gd/kP7w5a as a bad URL. In another environment, "the page's address isn't valid.".


















All-in-all I like this idea, but I want to raise one point of concern. Generally speaking, a user who needs help accessing a man page has a high likelihood of being a user who will might be a little freaked out when clicking on a link opens a terminal session and causes pages (and pages and pages) of gobbledy-gook to appear. Discuss.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Understood. Reference to a manual page alone (without Ask Different) is rarely a substitute for more explanatory help (within Ask Different). The intention here is to make the interface to the proper point of reference — when required — more user-friendly. Allowing OS X to use the predefined _Man Page_ settings is a reasonably consistent approach to easing use of Terminal. Concerning the gook and the potential for freakiness, I'll edit the opening question …


















Can't you use the API? The documentation for the API includes a reasonably user friendly console for you to retrieve data, although the response is in JSON.

I had everything I needed to qualify for Level 2 in the contest - the 20 required questions with 2 upvotes each, the votes, and even the sharing.

I posted a picture on my website with the text "Ask and answer questions about Macs! Click to see more!", which my users quickly ate up. They click on anything.

The links were tracked with a URL shortener, which let me see exactly how many clicks I had. After a short amount of time, my quota was filled (I looked at the URL shortener's stats and I saw for each of the 11 {just to be safe} ads, at least 15 clicks on each one). One of my users even signed up and made an account.

Thus, I was feeling pretty confident that my place was secured. Knowing that the site had probably some lag, I wasn't surprised when the share progress bar told me I had 7 - it was 5 a few minutes ago. I knew, thanks to the shortened URLs, that I was in the 'way past safe' category.

This all made it a complete surprise to me that I didn't get into Level Two. See http://thenewipadishere.com/http://thenewipadishere.com/; as of now, I'm still not listed.

Is it possible for a moderator or someone at Stack Exchange to take a look at the links I posted and investigate whether they should have been counted towards the contest?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why haven't some of my shares been recorded?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did you use the sharing feature to share a link to a question or answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle Cronin: I believe that I linked to questions (that had at least at 4 upvotes)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This same thing happened to bmike.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Andrew Larsson: But he's listed as a Level 2er!

But of course it didnt actually say this anyway in the rules.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jonathan.Yes, it does. Go to the contest page, click the Contest Ruies button, and look at the second bullet point. Everything is laid out there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I could have looked over some factors when I was checking out bmike's shares. There are so many variables to consider.


















Which link style did you use:

http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/1254/219

or

http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1254/what-happened-with-the-link-sharing

The second type doesn't count, it has to have your user number at the end of the link as with the first style.

If you want to make the contest administrator's jobs easier, provide a list of the URLs you advertised that you believe were clicked at least 5 times.  I imagine this information is still in your URL tracking service.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The first one. I clicked the G+ link button. Also, I'll try to find what URLs I used - I'll post them shortly (maybe tomorrow, it's a little late now for me)


















Some things to note:


As mentioned, links must be in the correct format (ending with your
user ID, 6730).
You must have 10 unique links. Posting a link to the same post
multiple times can only count towards one share.
To count as a share, each link (or all links to a specific post
combined) must be clicked by at least 5 unique IP addresses. Even if the URL shortener reports that a link has been clicked many times, it's possible that it has been clicked multiple times by the same person.
I'm not 100% sure, but it's my guess, that links to closed or deleted
questions aren't counted.


In general, the link tracking systems here are pretty reliable. They're not a new feature and are used for things other than contests.
Realistically, it is more likely that the URL shortener is reporting a different metric than Stack Exchange is recording (or misreporting altogether) than it is that Stack Exchange's tracking isn't working.

Moderators have no more access to link information or influence on contest results than you do; Stack Exchange will have to be the ones to investigate further.

Sorry that things aren't working out as expected!

To be sure that there's nothing wrong here, I looked at the server access logs, which record all requests to your shared URLs, not just those that eventually counted as a valid referral.

In looking at the logs, I made these two observations about a vast (!) majority of the requests:


They came in bunches. The requests didn't come naturally in a "hey, this looks interesting, I'll check it out" pattern; instead they look like a "here's a bunch of links, all of which I shall now click within quick succession, maybe even twice for good measure."
They either came very obviously from you, or the reqesting IP address belonged to one of these groups:


registered to an institution that you seem to have ties to,
registered to dedicated hosting providers,
well-known proxy.



I am therefore inclined to consider the assumption that you didn't meet the sharing requirements to be correct.

I think, now that the dust has settled and the winners notified from the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1181/the-new-ipad-is-here-ask-different-and-win-onerecent site-promotion campaign, it would be very useful for the organisers to see our thoughts on it all (and indeed have their say on how they saw it working).  Note that this is not a chance to complain about individual users/questions/answers/outcomes, but a chance to have your say on what you thought worked really well, and what if anything you think could be changed or improved in any future site promotions.

Please try to keep your answers constructive. If you have anything negative to say, feel free to say it, but try to also make suggestions as to what could be done in future to alleviate your concerns without simply complaining.  Again, let's keep from linking to specific contest content, and talk about the structure.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Reflection on the recent Site-Promotionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really like these suggestions - especially the ideas to (1) increase randomness in awarding prizes and (2) lower the number of posts required but increase the minimum score. The "point system" for getting entries into a drawing is interesting too. I will take these suggestions into account when planning future contests. Thanks for continuing to think through and give feedback!


















Rankings, prize assignments, and competitive behavior

I have 1 change that I would like to see incorporated into future competitions, and that is essentially having a way of selecting winners that does not result in users directly competing against each other, rather than themselves.  We should be trying to do the best we can achieve, not simply better than next guy.  The benchmark should be where your personal pride and motivation takes you, and not be judged against the next users aims.

I think that the original intent was to get people to promote the use of Ask Different to an expanded audience and increase general participation levels, and initially this happened very well, but towards the end of the competition this resulted in the voting percentages dropping hugely (anecdotaly, at least for the Level 3 users) as users realised that complying with the spirit of the competition might have an affect on their chances of winning the iPads.  This has a knock on affect that latter Q&As were top heavy on answers, often similar answers, and low on votes which could produce the outlook to the new users we were trying to attract that no-one was providing genuinely good answers, which is obviously contrary to the aims of the site in general, never mind the competition.  You can look at pretty much anyones rep curve for the 3 week period and see this marked "Hump" affect as the patterns altered during the period.

In order to prevent this, I have 2 recommendations:


Provide a greater element of Randomness when selecting winners.  There were 10 Level 3 users, and if the rules had been something like "The Top Score wins an iPad for being amazing, everyone else is in a raffle to win the remaining 4" it would have produced odds of 4 in 9 to win an iPad - this is still really really great odds that would inspire people to work hard, and means that there is no difference to coming 2nd or 10th, so long as you worked hard enough to get into that level in the first place.  "Tactical" voting would be greatly reduced, as it would not really be possible to affect the result by doing it.
Either cut down on the ability to follow other users scores, or go the whole hog and provide the whole story in the contest progress pages.  Looking at the lists (and knowing that there was a big difference between 5th and 6th) made it very tempting to compare your results against other users and use that as a basis for choosing who to selectively fail to vote for.  During the last few hours of the contest it turned out that at least 4 people in the top 10 had written scripts to query the APIs and rank the current contestant scores.  Whilst the data is public, better to either stop it happening (possibly by not explicitely starting the exact tie-break mechanism from the start) or level the playing field and prepare them for everyone up front.


Lastly, a big thanks to everyone at SE that helped to organise the thing - We know that @Lauren and @balpha were heavily involved, but I am sure that there are more names behind the doors that also deserve thanks.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ha! You *so* lifted that odds and raffle idea from me. It's cool though. :) FWIW I don't think being able to calculate totals would matter one iota if the final prizes were awarded by raffle. It only mattered because we were competing with each other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Was it four different scripts, or did four people just run Ian C.'s script? (The raffle idea seems very good to me)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it was at least 3 different ones, but I think 4 - could have got confused.  In the last hour I even used Ian's myself (and didn't feel proud for looking).  I think everyone in the top 10 knew the lineup through use/visibility of someone elses script/results, even if they did not write one themselves.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I had one. Kyle C had one. And at least one other person wrote one that I recall. Kyle and I made ours available near the end: https://gist.github.com/2288184


















Share links on @StackApple Twitter

IMHO, the @StackApple Twitter account shouldn’t tweet or retweet a contest entrant’s personalised share links while the contest is still running. This is unfair towards other people who participate in the contest.

Here’s an example of such a tweet: http://twitter.com/stackapple/status/185739657777135616http://twitter.com/stackapple/status/185739657777135616 It links to http://goo.gl/q01yJ, which in turn redirects to http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/46077/11610?stw=1, which is the personalised twitter share link for one of the contest participants.

When tweeting during a promotion whomever is in charge of the twitter account simply needs to ensure that they do not use the linking buttons, or remembers to strip the userID off the end of the URL.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suspect that this is a case of the *right hand* (the reTweet Daemon) not knowing what the *left hand* (the contest) is doing. It's an artifact of *complex systems* and the effort required to prevent this may too great and the result too *damaging* to the system. It's a better solution  just take the *hit points* and accept that it's an imperfect, and sometimes unfair, universe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Depending on how much effort anyone wants to put into this, the retweeting system could automatically expand short URLs, and replace the link with a non-referral version before tweeting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The stackapple account is part of the natural system. Needing to change the way the system works just for the contest is a symptom of a problem in the contest or the system.  It would be similar to changing the way voting works for the duration of the contest - rather than that, let's look at the consequences and change the contest so the contest fits the system, rather than fitting the system to the contest.  In cases of individual abuse (say someone figured out a way to get the bot to retweet them 80% of the time) then that would be dealt with individually. Otherwise it's not an issue.


















Rule clarifications and tie-breaking

Some clarifications were made to the contest rules in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1220/how-exactly-would-winners-be-determined-if-more-than-five-users-complete-levela meta post. Next time around, if these particular rules still apply, they can simply be added to the initial ruleset to reduce confusion.

And a probably not crucial point: the rules (taking into account the later clarifications) were clear about what happened if more people than prizes were in a given level (the top users in a level, by score on contest posts, would get the prizes) — but they weren't clear on tie-breaking among the top users in a level. (https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1181/the-new-ipad-is-here-ask-different-and-win-oneDuring this contest, there was a two-way tie for 5th place in Level 3 — while probably unusual, it would be nice to see this case explicitly covered in the rules.)

To further the theme, requests for clarification were made (and responded to) all over the place: New questions, Answers to those questions, "Answers" on the original Meta post, Comments everywhere, Chat.  It would be good to maintain a "clarifications" answer to the original post, and move all such content into it.  This might be a job for Mods.  Might be good to have a specific Chat room also for such talk.

Apparently you can now append a s m l to the image URL before the jpg and get a scaled version, but this scaling seems to degrade the quality quite a bit. https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/884/pixelpalooza-requesting-a-feature-to-normalize-sizing-of-portrait-ios-screen-iSame for making them 200px wide.




Yes - I believe changing the embed from ![] to <img> and specifying size x and y works to keep the original image intact yet display a smaller version. I have asked for this to be automated, but it doesn't appear to be getting many up votes. (it's a long question - not so sharp - perhaps it's time to edit it down and ask on the main meta site)
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/884Pixelpalooza - Requesting a feature to normalize sizing of portrait iOS screen images by default (not just for landscape images)

I am doing an academic research regarding professional communities and I want to validate the outcomes of using motivational factors and one of them is the usage of contests like the iPad contest.

How can I obtain access to such information?

Here are some of the things I'm trying to find answers to (you don't need to answer them)


Is motivation lost after contest? Does it modify the overall trend and if it does in which way?
To which extend is the quality of the contributions affected by the contest? Do we start getting "spam"?
Can we do a cost-benefit analysis on motivational contest? If so how? While computing the cost would be easy, how can we count the results in money?
What percent of the increased traffic is from new audience? While it’s obvious that motivating people to share it will increase the overall site visibility. It would be interesting to see if there is a link between the increase in traffic and the creation of new accounts. This would help up identify if the „quality“ of the new audience, as the increase in traffic is not a target.


Quantitative


visits/week
new questions/week
new answers/week
new accounts/week


Note: at this moment I consider the week as optimum, as it should minimise the seasonality  and still be small enough to deal with changes due to different events (like a contest). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can I get more detailed statistics on site usage?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you add more detail about what sort of statistics you are looking to find?  Things like answer rates before/during/after the contest etc?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, things like this, but I will compute a detailed list and update the answer.


















What if, for tie-breaker purposes only, votes up or down from other competitors at the same level simply did not count? They count to get you into the level but they do not count as tiebreaker votes. 

This would not harm anyone's eligibility for a prize and if there was no tiebreaker would not affect anything. It has a downside in that legitimate and disinterested appreciation or otherwise from peers will not be counted as tiebreaker votes- but like a judge who has interest in an entity in court, recusal may be the lesser evil. It does allow votes to be cast in the out-of-competition sense without effect on the competition. 

And it also maintains the suspense in chat next time, as nobody's script can tell just who cast the votes and so nobody knows the final outcome until official results appear >:-)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds like a good idea, but I think that this granularity of knowing exactly who voted for who is simply not available to anyone.  The system can spot trends for the purpose of identifying suspicious behaviour, but not individual votes.  Also, on 2nd thoughts it stands to reason that the top voted contributors are at the top for a reason, and thus excluding their own votes might not necessarily be the best indicator of what makes a good answer or not.


















Hyphenated Tags Must be Outlawed

Read on...

Tags is an indexed-sequential search, not random access

I.E. The tag filters on a major idea. It is supposed to be a quick narrowing of possibilities with a high likelihood of picking up specifics I'm looking for (assuming they exist in the first place, of course). At that point the brain takes over looking in detail at the search results. 

As we "engineer" specificity into our tagging system we move toward the idea of a single query, a single tag to find exactly what I'm looking for. I assert that this bad, anti-tagish. Let's just use SQL for crying out loud.

Are hyphenated tag names transitive?

I see https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipod-applicationsipod-applications as different from https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applications-ipodapplications-ipod.

In the first case I'm "looking for ipod stuff" and in the latter I'm looking for "application stuff". How I think about my search matters.

What is the results implication of including both hyphened-versions? Who knows how the hell the tags were used when at least 4 tags may be involved here! I don't want to know - and I don't have to know if we ban hyphen-tags.

Major points of tagging goodness are:


Very little time spent constructing the query.
There are no semantics & syntax to know about - including implied or assumed semantics of hyphenated tags.
1-off tag proliferation makes tracking favorites impossible.
Specificity is gotten by using multiple tags - and it's syntax free
A broadly cast net so I don't waste my time looking for stuff that was filtered out by too much tag specificity
There is a gross assumption that the searcher knows (a) how to search a rendered web page and (b) search with tag/literal-text in the first place.


Hyphenated tags should be outlawed

We must not corrupt the tag space. I can easily search for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applicationsapplications https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipodipod without having to worry if I just ruined my search by including (or not!) https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipod-applicationsipod-applications or vice versa or vice-and-versa.

I would make exceptions, for example https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbook-promacbook-pro because this cannot mean "macbook or macbook pro". I prefer it to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbookpromacbookpro, but would defer if it is confusing or non-hyphenation were enforced @ creation time.

You should quickly see several things:


Tags become reusable. You can "recommend" or "version" on anything!
Tags are meant to identify general concepts. Combining tags gives sufficient, flexible specificity.
Excellent cross reference flexibility
There are no "shades of meaning" in a tag, therefore any given tag, or combination of tags, is more likely to hit on what I'm looking for.
In a hyphenated-tag rich environment you must ask yourself "What fraken tags did I miss because there are so many that I know I did not find just the right "synonym" tag!!
Hyphen-tagging quickly degenerates into hyper inflation of tags, tags-per-question, and tags-per-query. AND ironically, significantly increasing the probability that you will not, indeed cannot, find what you're looking for.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This proposal fundamentally breaks the purpose of the tag system. Tags exist to help people identify questions they want to read and answer. Tags are atomic; they do not nest, nor is there a way for one tag to modify another. If there were, this proposal could be helpful, but as currently implemented in the SE engine, there is not. version4 is not a useful tag; no one would be interested in the fourth version of all software, but not the third or fifth. [ipod][safari][version4] has no way of designating whether [version4] is the fourth version of the iPod or of Safari.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Absolutely enforces the purpose of tags. Tags need to be inclusive, not exclusive. These conversations of [tag:ipad-applications] vice [tag:applications-ipad], or "2g" vice "original" (iphone). Try to imagine how many hyphenated tags will you need to ensure coverage on just these things! These discussions are precisely the problem writ large. With proper tags there is no need for discussion (or tag maintenance over time by @Dori). I guarantee that proliferation of concept-narrowing tags will gradually ruin Tag useability in StackExchange sites.

Two things work very well.

1) Edit the question to remain historically significant - answer at time. You can edit the answer if needed or just comment that this is no longer true.

1a) If the basic need is still there, re-ask the new question and link the two explaining how the old question isn't the answer since X, Y, and Z have changed.

2) Edit / comment the question to indicate how old answers are not relevant with new X arriving.

So - here are the guiding principles as I see them.


preserve value and votes on an old question - the more popular the old question, the more inclined I am to just leave it and move on (option 1).
edit / comment to add commentary when things change and old content is stale and needs further explanations.


It's really your choice - neither is wrong to choose. The only wrong move is to allow the incorrect content to sit without at least a comment explaining the new circumstances. Again, you don't have to do even that, but from a "how should it be handled" ideal situation - always addressing things that need help is the correct answer.

" -- or otherwise describe the conditions where the answer remains valid. Then you can ask another question which is based on your old question but with the conditions updated (say, Mac OS X 10.2.3). Remember to link the new question to the old one so that it doesn't get marked as duplicate.


















Should OS version (E.g. 10.7.3) be included on all standard Operating System questions for future reference? As Operating Systems release updates and/or New Operating systems are released all together, multiple changes occur that may nullify previous answers. By making it mandatory to include the full version on any standard OS question we could ensure the integrity of the answers on apple.stackexchange.com as well as provide opportunities for new answers when updates and new Operating Systems are released.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should OS version be included on OS specific questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1141/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do not agree with Vivart's concept. It is not necessary for all questions to include multiple specs. However, as previously posted I do believe it is a solid idea to provide the OS version. What is to be done with questions that are the same but would naturally have different answers due to the OS version?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see this as an opportunity for more questions followed by more reliable answers.


















This is a modified version of https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1144/2220my answer on https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1141/i-think-system-specifications-should-show-as-signature/1144#1144I think system specifications should show as signature?.

I've seen similar systems implemented on other sites (like the Apple Discussions).

The current system is to specify the OS in the body of the question and/or in a tag. I think that way works pretty well; it gives users an easy way to include the info and gives us an easy way to organize things.

The idea of making people know and tell us their OS is good, but I don't think it would work well on Ask Different.

(Note: I'm assuming we would require this information for questions tagged with any of the OS tags.)


Detailed OS info isn't always necessary. This would force people to include info even when it isn't necessary (not all questions tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osxosx need a version specified).
Dedicated OS info would frequently be redundant. We'd run the risk of causing redundancy by requiring people to specify their OS version if they have already specified it in the body of their question or in a tag.


I don't think that adding system info separately is the right path to take.

What I would like to see, though, is another 'reminder' item shown while posting a question that tells people to be sure to include all relevant hardware and software information.

Of course people wouldn't always follow it, but commenting and asking for info is easy, and people generally respond to it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with your thought of having a reminder. However, I also have a concern with OS specific searching in the future. If their isn't a tag or specific version information provided in the title how would a quick search for a common question look? The user who is hoping for answers may find themselves diving through multiple answers before finding one that actually works with their OS.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nathan... Did you give me a downvote? :(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@E1Suave No, I didn't. I think the idea is valid and worth consideration, even if I don't agree with it. Don't worry about downvotes, though. That's just how people show whether or not they support an idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK thanks. It's my first question. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OS specific tags can also work against future searches, particularly if the problem/solution apply to multiple versions of the OS. In general, I believe fewer-broader tags serve us better than more-specific tags do.


















Different iterations of iOS and Mac OS X have more in common than they have differences. While OS versions are sometimes very relevant to the answer to a program, frequently they are not. I see no reason whatsoever to require questions to be more specific than necessary.

It is not rare for a question to omit important information. Occasionally, that missing information is the operating system. But this seems like a solution in search of a problem that our community, for the most part, does not have.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I certainly do not mean to imply that there is a problem. Just thought that it could be a nice addition for future searches. Certainly there are major differences between Panther and Lion (2003 - 2011). However, many questions once asked about Panther may have many similarities to questions still asked about Lion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm all in favor of including versions where relevant, and editing old questions and answers when changes make the answer become version-specific. But I'm opposed to requiring version information, or even encouraging it when it doesn't change the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How is one to know if the answer will be different on a future release? If this judgement is to be based on anyones opinion outside of Apple it is highly likely that future questions will have answers that do not define any version specifics. What if we were to have questions asked 8 years ago about Panther, and no specific version information was deemed necessary and made available. And what if today a user searches for a similar question hoping for an answer and thinks they have found one. Unfortunately in this case the answer has no hope of being helpful on the user's Lion machine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However in agreeing with your point that not all things change and much of the OS will stay very similar, I would hate for users to simply disregard answers because the answered date was ages ago or the system version was old. I just think there is a need for something to set apart OS version specific answers, aside from the judgement of one who may not care or think about adding this information.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5According to the community wiki "Unless the question is obviously completely hardware-related (which it almost never is), include your version of Mac OS. You can get this from the "About This Mac" window." This was based on the answer to your question "Help! My computer doesn't work" 6 months ago.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/890/help-my-computer-doesnt-work  Are you in disagreement with the answer/community wiki tagged FAQ? I see that the answer was not accepted. Perhaps you disagree with the community wiki. What I am pointing out is that down the road it may not be as easy to search for related questions nor create new questions because the wording will be so similar even though the answer is not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The post to which you refer is about best practices: it's great advice, but not a requirement. It also applies specifically to **troubleshooting** posts not to all posts. If someone is trying to fix something broken, OS version information can be very helpful. There are many other categories posts that don't need OS version information, though, and we don't usually add a lot of **requirements** here. You seem to propose we make it mandatory (how? delete all posts that don't include OS info?), and that's not how we generally roll here. Good idea often, helpful, but not a general requirement.


















Apple's http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/APStyleGuide/APSG_2009.pdfStyle Guide (page 116) uses this method:


  Pull-down menus:  Note hyphenation. A pull-down menu is a menu in the

  Choose [menu] > [item] > [submenu item]
  Choose Edit > Find > Find Next
  Choose File > Save As.
  


I don't think it should be a rule, but such a guideline would be helpful for new users and would increase the consistency/legibility  of the site. There's a good reason to have style guides.

Yes - the site design is for everyone to suggest edits.

The how is simple - click the edit button and you will have a window to make changes. There is context based help explaining how to edit and how to work the tools.

Once you've proposed an edit, it goes into a queue. There is a review process where people that haven't gained the reputation to make solitary edits require someone else to green light the edits.

You will find the chat room a great place to link to questions for learning how to edit as well as gaining confidence that someone will approve them.

For now - jump in and propose some edits you feel will make the site better and see how they are received. Like anything, start slow and build up your confidence about what works and what doesn't. As you gain reputation, the site will link you to the guides on how to edit - but for now as a new user, just try a few and we'll see how it goes.



The only time I've seen edits be problematic is when there is back and forth where two people have differing tastes or when someone makes a lot of edits in a short time - driving the other changed content from the recent activity tab.

You can submit feedback and bug reports to Apple via their http://www.apple.com/feedback/feedback page. Additionally, bug reports can also be sent https://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/the Apple developer bug report page. (requires a free Apple developer account, does not require the $99/year paid account).


  Can I post a question related to an issue that is clearly not supposed to happen and of which I assume can't be solved by a simple answer?


If it can't be solved by a simple answer, I would say, no, don't ask the question. If you look at the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bugbug tag excerpt, you'll see: 


  This tag will be used in discussions identifying potential bugs and seeking ways to circumvent or correct them.


(I know this is a bit of circular reasoning, as the meta site is supposed to influence the main site, not vice versa, but in this case, I think the current status of this is fine and shouldn't be changed.)
So, using the existing excerpt, I would say that questions that doesn't have an answer that will "circumvent or correct [the bugs]," do not have a place here on Ask Different. Questions that don't really have an answer don't have value down the road. Bugs especially don't add value to the site, as software is constantly changing and will more than likely not be applicable a year or two down the road.

TL;DR: Questions about bugs that don't have an answer should not be asked.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would agree 80% with the above, but add that I would still ask the question regardless.  Because even though it's a bug that cannot be *directly* resolved, there may be a wealth of workarounds which address the immediate issue and could help many people with the same problem.  Sometimes a question doesn't need to be answerable, so long as the answers provide genuine strategies or mechamisms for doing avoiding the bug in some other way. The key is your use of the word assume - you should never assume that the guys who read your question can't give you a great answer that you weren't expectingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree in principle that the answerability of a question has any bearing on whether a question is a good  or bad. If you have a question that relates to a specific problem you face in using an Apple product then I would encourage you to ask it. We can rely upon the community editing process turn it into something that's worth keeping around even if you're not up to formulating a perfect question on your first attempt at wording the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe Yes. I agree. Even if a question can't be *directly* resolved, if there is an answer for it that can "circumvent or correct [the bug], ask it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Okay, very true. However, I have to disagree slightly that some questions (related to bugs) do not really have a good place in the community as the bugs oftentimes disappear along with the problems.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't tar all bug questions with a broad brush just because some or many are asked poorly. We discourage whiny, opinionated, poorly worded, poorly researched, unuseful, overly broad and/or narrow questions without caring if they are about bugs or not. Also - optimizing questions is always secondary to optimizing for answers. Bugs are fertile ground for good answers that explain so I don't want anyone thinking we discourage questions about bugs. The [FAQ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) is clear on this - if bug question were something we wanted to discourage, it would be stated there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Okay. Agreed.


















We like good questions that are objective or are of the good subjective sort. That is the overriding criteria for whether a question should be asked. We also like clear questions that invite a paragraph-length answer that will be of use to the worldwide population.

Q: Is clicking on X in Y after update 10.7.3 is applied a bug?

This hypothetical question invites two potential answers: yes and no. It's something we generally wouldn't encourage on the site. That doesn't mean someone can not come in with an awesome long involved answer that explains what changed and why people need to know about how they can work around this bug.  A good answer can in almost all cases save a bad question from deletion, but that doesn't mean the question as originally asked is necessarily a good question. 

A better question explains why a bug might be noticed or detected and sometimes even show some research that invites a better answer. 

Some guidelines:


state the facts and don't rant about the bug (or worse, try to turn it into an editorial about why Apple is so bad or do programmers are so bad or why you're so clever )
explain how you've isolated the bug and why you think it's a bug (do some research and actually show the research you've done in the wording of the question)
be clear whether you're looking for troubleshooting advice or are looking for an objective answer to your specific problem


As long as the question is more about using a Mac and less about a short window of time where there's a bug that gets resolved quickly, questions about buggy software can be of benefit to the site and worth keeping around. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also - one of the most common mistakes I see in asking a poorly worded question is worrying too much about what you think the answer might be. Forget for a moment that you suspect the issue you have is a bug, and just think clearly about stating the issue.  With software, surprise is more about your expectations. This famously is summarized as "bug or feature" - the fact that software does X can easily be viewed as either. Yes - some things are clearly bugs, but the water gets murky quickly in many cases. Focus on the question and you should be fine.


















I guess I haven't found the right search terms to find this on my own, so I figured I ask.

This site is the place where questions about using Apple products and all apple programs except for iTunes Connect.

I personally want to build consensus (if there is actual consensus) to broaden that scope to allow iTunes connect questions https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51084/iphone-app-now-is-pending-contract-will-it-be-removed-from-the-itunes-storelike the one you asked.

Your question isn't complicated, is covered in Apple's FAQ that isn't something under NDA (although much of the mechanics of developing is under NDA - and most developers do not hang out here).

The only place I see for you to ask this topic currently is on Stack Overflow - but again, it's not a great fit in my eyes. I believe they prefer hard programming questions - not soft program and policy questions.



In any event - as a developer, you have email, phone and web support from Apple - so even if your account has lapsed, you can sign up for a free tier of access and still have a point to ask them about the mechanics of the program.

Please do weigh in on the discussion over here and in the chat room if you want to change things here (either for or against changing the FAQ)

So I've read that there were a few proposals creating a sister site covering these kind of questions. But they are never opened because they don't want to create a sister site on area51 because this site is already there and others putting SO as alternative.

Then I'm back on this site with a question about developing apps and It's not welcome here :-)

So back to SO but it seams to global for me. 

I do agree that creating al sorts of small sites is too much.
Like drupal has his own site, questions about drupal are sometimes ported to the drupal site while the response on SO is better.
and then there is also programming which also could be merged with SO IMHO.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it is too unclear where to post a question and getting down votes on those questions isn't a way to welcome new users...

I'm fine with posting a question on a different site to keep it all clean, but it seams odd to allow some sister sites and disallow others. I vote for one format for all sites so all is clear and confusion avoided. Even if that means disappointing some users.

As a side note I must admit that the "apple" stackexchange site triggered me to post my development question.

Why not let developers use this site as well? 'normal' users can unfollow the developer tag and even get support of developers hanging out here with 'user' questions?

If you ask an Xcode question there, you will get an answer. If you ask _anything_ related to programming there, you will get an answer. Diverting away from SO in an attempt to be special just weakens SO. There is an important distinction with *Programmers*: it's for higher level discussions on concepts really, not just "why isn't this code working?" As a student myself, I appreciate that *Programmers* is something for me to graduate to, not just wander in and pollute.


















This is an intentional feature and not simply a bug. 

The reasons for it are enumerated here (as well as the regex used to neuter presumably excessively wordy tag summaries):

I really don't think this should be a grey area, or "muddy waters". 


iTunes Connect is an Apple Service.
The site definition includes "other Apple products or services"


Therefore it already fits in the definition of this site. 

The problem is someone has added an exception to the definition. I don't see anywhere the community deciding on that exception. So why is it there?

iTunes Connect is just as much an Apple service as iCloud.com is.

Xcode and developing was the initial iTunes connect user base and that is also something that is off topic here, so I think that explains the initial reluctance to embrace this change. It's much trickier to allow some ITC questions and not others - just like beta SW, NDA topics, etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've listed some questions I want to keep in a separate answer. After discussing things with the other elected moderators, the initial decision was made to separate the site from the developer centric Stack Overflow and well before itunes-connect became a multi billion dollar enterprise. Times change and this is how we work out if and how we will change with the times.


















Context: This post follows the guidelines https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/132282/how-can-i-get-stack-exchange-to-send-me-to-a-conferenceplaced here (link) for StackExchange conference attendance sponsorship.

I got an email on friday from Apple that I've been awarded an https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/Apple WWDC Student Scholarship. (The WWDC student scholarship is essentially just a free conference ticket. Scholarships were offered to student developers ages 13 and up.) I'm going to San Francisco for the event. Yay! I'd like to get a StackExchange sponsorship to cover airfare and hotel stay if possible.


Who is going?

I'm going.
What conference is it, and what will you be doing there, besides attending?

WWDC is Apple's annual developer conference. Typically, Apple announces updates to iOS and Mac OS and occasionally some other cool things. I'll be just attending, unless you consider being awesome "doing something", cuz I'll be doing that to. If the community approves, I'll also be promoting AskDifferent.
When  is the conference running? We need at least a month’s lead time to help you get your approval. If you’re under or near that before posting, you might want to think about next year instead.

The conference runs in just about a month from now, from June 11th through the 15th, 2012. It might be a bit late, but I only found out about the scholarship on Friday.
Where  is the conference located and how do you intend to get there?

The conference is Moscone West in San Francisco, California. I'm in New York City so I plan to fly out. My iPhone doesn't have teleportation built in - yet. 

"Siri, take me to Moscone West at -" 

"I know where Moscone West is, thank you. Please adjust your helmet and tell me when you're ready to go."
Why should the community approve you to go to this sponsorship? More importantly, why should the community approve going to this specific conference? Basically, what will you do to bring this learning back to the community?

I'm a long time member of the StackExchange network. I've been active on StackOverflow for over two years. I've got 11 gold badges including fanatic. I was among those awarded the first batch of AskDifferent Swag. I also won an iPod in the recent new iPad contest. So, yea, I participate.

I've met with Lauren and Seth at StackExchange HQ in the New York and brought back swag to my class in college, and promoted English.SE there. (Thanks guys, that was awesome.) I'm constantly pushing StackExchange to friends, classmates, coworkers and more. This would be another opportunity to do that. 

WWDC is chock full of Apple and that's the exact audience of this site. It would be an opportunity to bring more experts users to one of the best Apple websites on the internet. I love speaking and meeting people. StackExchange is something that I can get excited about, and I will do my best, if approved, to promote AskDifferent at WWDC.

Again, my ticket is already paid for by Apple. A StackExchange sponsorship would cover airfare (around $500 or so) and hotel stay. (Although I'm looking into another option which would eliminate the hotel costs altogether.) 


edit:

I've been developing http://apps.mosheberman.comapps for over 2 years now. Most of my work is geared to the Jewish community, but I've got http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nippon/id415518235?mt=8a game on the store and http://blog.mosheberman.com/meet-team-moflotz/I'm working on an RPG as well.

In [chat, I put words to my thinking](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/4597729#4597729) but I'd be more inclined to support some AD swag for this developer conference and perhaps seek financial support from a more developer centric meta like MSO or programmers rather than here. Again - it's totally your call. This speakers-bureau is very new, so no one really knows how it will work yet.


















Yes, iTunes Connect should be on topic both here and on Web Apps.

While all of the answers here are technically correct, there's another option:

See http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/30702/app-storesthis proposal (link), which would encompass iTunes Connect and (shudder) Google Play, and other similar services. 

Edit:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10635046/to-receive-money-from-apple-developer-i-need-multi-currency-bank-accountThis question seems off topic on AskDifferent, but would be on topic on App Stores.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Area 51 proposal for App Stores doesn't seem to include music sales, iBook sales, iAd sales but only iOS and Mac app stores. Even if that site were up, I'd still want the basic user level questions on iTunes Connect to have an audience here. If other sites also allow them - we can handle it like mac questions on Super User / ServerFault and Ask Different. Focusing on the users makes it clear that overlap can work well for the site as a whole. Hopefully iTunes connect can do the same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What do you think of the answer I have just added?

I was collecting some stats on tags and wanted to share them with the group. There are about 230 questions currently (out of 16,000 total questions) that relate to Microsoft Office.

The MS-Office tag might make a good landing point for all questions relating to that software suite.



If we merged these small topics and left synonyms so that someone that wanted to ask a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ms-wordms-word (or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wordword) question, it wouldn't start again, but get lumped under Office. The benefit of having more questions using less tags is that https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1048/how-are-tag-badges-chosenthe people answering a category of questions get recognized more rapidly.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ms-office/topusershttps://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/ms-office/topusers

The downside is of course that larger tags lack specificity.

The only downside I can see is that we would lose the distinction of each product and people that are interested in following just Excel questions would not be able to sift out the rest of the questions easily. Yes, they could use an RSS feed for the search term - and the question will undoubtedly have the word Excel (or Powerpoint, Entourage, etc...) embedded in them so searchers will always find just the question they want regardless of how it's tagged.

Here are the current followers of these tags:



At present, it seems that the downside is small and the upside is larger, but I don't want to initiate a merging if everyone would rather wait this out and sees a benefit to the site of keeping these tags distinct.

So, if you have a Yes or No opinion, please start that answer and discussion below:

I'm using a Mac right now to post this. And I'm not "different".

So why is this site called "Ask Different"?  In my opinion, it kind of sounds like you think Mac users are somehow "different", and this is alienating, in a way.

Plus what if the Mac user market shot up to 25% over a few years, for some weird reason?  Would we be "asking different" then, or "asking mainstream?"

I just don't think it's nice to call Mac users "Different".  Different from what? The mainstream?  Do you have to highlight it this way?  May be viewed as marginally offensive.

Ask Different is a play on the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_differentThink Different ad campaign that Apple ran in the '90s.



The Ask part just represents one of the site's core functions, asking.

The goal is in no way to label Apple users as somehow different; it's just a bit of nostalgia.

It **really** should be __**differently**__ ;}


















In theory, I could see people who are experts in Word/Excel/PowerPoint having significant non-overlap with people who are experts in Outlook/Entourage.
In practice, given the small number of followers for any of these tags, I suspect merging the tags as synonyms for a common ms-office tag should offer appropriate granularity for the users we do have.
I would reiterate my belief (if I say it often enough, does that make it true?) that tags are primarily intended as neither informational labels nor search keywords, but specifically as filter terms. If there are this few posts conning the tags and they are followed by this few readers, we don't need this level of granularity.
Merge.

I'll check with the other moderators and get cleaning if there's no need to keep things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've checked around and the benefit seems to outweigh the risk of collapsing these tags. I'll be on the hook to manually undo this if we discover a bad effect. For now, the tags comprising the office components synonimize to [tag:ms-office] We've got 184 questions in that category at present. http://cl.ly/GqnOb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like how this worked up to now with the tags merged. FYI I just made a one-note tag and we might need to revisit this based on how Microsoft rolls out iOS and Mac versions of their products in the coming months. (assuming the rumor mills are reporting smoke from a fire and not smoke from a screen)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now that these products exist on iOS and OS X, the waters have become more murky. I'm not at all convinced that splitting them up makes sense - especially if we can have tags for things that aren't bundled with the Office in the vast majority of the use cases. (OneDrive and OneNote come to mind).

In general, if you flag several posts by the same user, a moderator will likely notice the pattern and investigate. We often can be quite perceptive when things are amiss. Flags are quite helpful, and that would usually be sufficient (as it was in this case).

If, however, you find that does not work for some reason because there is a larger or more complex question about the site, a new question asked on meta (like this one) shows up in our inboxes to draw our attention to it.

In other words, the two things you did (flag and meta post, in that order) are ways to accomplish what you hoped to accomplish.

Please do not unless you ask on chat or flag for a moderator. We would rather help edit it if you have any doubts if it will be on-topic.

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1115/9388Kyle Cronin's answer about Mountain Lion seems to apply fully here to questions about other pending versions as well.

While it is possible that there is a question about [generic future OS] that would be appropriate for this site, the overwhelming majority of [generic future OS] questions will be closed because


[generic future OS] is not yet a shipping product, and as such, its features may change before it ships. Any questions answered about the current state of [generic future OS] could easily not be accurate by the time the product ships. As such, these questions are too localized.
Questions about what features it will contain in the future when it is released are speculative; no one knows (not even Apple engineers) what the final shipping version of the product will be. So questions asking about what features will be in the final version are not a real question that can be answered.
Questions about the specifics of [generic future OS] are in most cases unanswerable except by people who have signed a Non-disclosure Agreement. Both the answerer and the site could get into trouble if we allow answers to be posted here that violate such an agreement.
The small set of questions that ask about publicly available information tend to be both localized in time (not relevant once the product actually ships) and lend themselves to a very short answer. Questions like "Has Apple publicly announced a timeline for the next version of iOS?" do not violate an NDA, but really lend themselves to a one-sentence answer; these are not the sorts of questions we want to encourage on this site.


While questions will be considered on a case-by-case basis, I find it unlikely that any [generic future OS] questions posted in the near future will remain open on the site. If you have a counterexample of a question that invites a long answer, is likely to be stable even after the software is complete, and can be answered without risking violating an NDA, I'd love to hear about it, but I remain skeptical that a good question will emerge.

Anyone who legitimately can run iOS6 has Apple's discussion boards for assistance and seeding the site with speculation seems not worth encouraging any questions on software that isn't finished.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike People with access to iOS6 are explicitly **not** who am expecting to generate the legitimate questions here. Someone making plans for the future who wants to know if current hardware will support desired feature `x` is more who I had in mind.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Point 1 is the single reason I closed the question in the first place. I should have picked too localized and not off topic. I also explained it poorly in the question itself. Apologies all around.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Precisely. Questions will be asked, but we optimize primarily for _great answers_. So now we have a situation where in good faith someone asks a good question but everyone that _knows_ the answer can't (or shouldn't) answer due to their word being pledged to not divulge NDA.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"… to know if current hardware will support desired feature `x` …" – such things can not be known with certainty until after Apple publishes an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GrahamPerrin exactly. Occasionally Apple publishes such answers. Frequently they do not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm with you @DanielLawson on the main answer. It's great that we're sympathetic/empathetic to people making plans but whatever a person's plan, it shouldn't change the nature of this meta answer. Patience pays dividends in terms of quality Q&A :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just wanted to raise an objection to this. This site is not owned by apple and many of its users are not bound by any such NDA and might be able to provide assistance to those who need it.  This site should not pretend to be an official pr channel for Appleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NeilNeyman It has nothing to do with PR, and we clearly aren't an official anything for Apple. But pre-release software is only distributed to people who agree to non-disclosure terms, whether through the developers' program or something else. I'm not bound by an NDA, and neither are a lot of people, but pre-release software is not yet stable and the answers are likely to change as the software continues to develop.


















Our official name has recently been upgraded to Ask Different (instead of Apple). This is something we've been https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/433/please-change-name-of-site-from-apple-to-ask-differenthoping for for a long time, and I'm thrilled that it's happened. I don't want this post to come across as complain-y or ungrateful, it's just a little detail I noticed and wanted to mention.

The change seems to have propagated throughout the site and network now: we're Ask Different in the site's title, the SE sites list, the newsletter, etc.

However, in some places (like the https://apple.stackexchange.com/aboutabout page), the name is displayed as 'Ask Different - Stack Exchange'.

This sounds weird to me: Apple - Stack Exchange made sense because 'Apple' was not the site's brand; we were part of the Stack Exchange brand. Now that we officially have the distinct brand 'Ask Different', keeping SE on the end seems a little messy and unnecessary (even without '-SE' it's still clear that we're part of the SE network).

SE's David Fullerton mirrored this observation in his https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4237/a-new-name-for-gaming-stack-exchangeoriginal post on Arqade:


  About the only thing we can agree on right now is that “XXXXX Stack Exchange” is not a brand -- it’s too long, descriptive, and forgettable.


I've noticed this on Arqade as well: they are 'Arqade - Stack Exchange' in some places, not just 'Arqade'. Wasn't this one of the reasons (a small one, but a reason nonetheless) for the change in the first place?

Personally, I'm in favor of removing the ' - Stack Exchange' from the end of 'Ask Different'.
Thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we keep ' - Stack Exchange' at the end of our name?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm utterly indifferent at this point, just releived to be Ask Different and not Apple Stack Exchange. But I'm open to being swayed, if this is something we think is worth agitating for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson Don't get me wrong, I feel the same way. I just think, since we're doing this, we should go all the way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I raised a similar concern regarding inconsistency with this stuff over at [Meta.Arqade](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/4878/vote-to-close-dialog-needs-some-cleanup-for-the-new-domain). Notable is that all 'named' non-trilogy sites (Arqade, Ask Different, AskUbuntu) share the **Clever Name -- Stack Exchange** notation, which the trilogy lacks. Make of it what you will.




















Enough said?

Personally I would refer to them via the general model information:


iPad 3 Wi-Fi Only
iPad 3 CDMA
iPad 3 GSM


Distinct enough, no?

Information about the region+carrier only if relevant.

That's just adding a 4th method :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sure model numbers make sense to Apple and the carriers, but with other users (us), not as necessary.


















I have a specific question I'm wondering how to handle now that all the MobileMe changes are about to fade into history this June when MobileMe goes away:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14049/is-it-possible-to-use-back-to-my-mac-dns-or-routing-information-from-the-commandIs it possible to use Back To My Mac DNS or routing information from the command line?

As you can see in this particular case - the right answer is shifting, so it's up to me (the OP) to see the new answer and select it. (assuming I want this to be about iCloud and the current Back To My Mac). 

I'm inclined to ask a new question specifically about Lion's iCloud BTMM - and leave this question alone as historical reference.

Is this a good idea in general - leave decent enough questions alone and ask a new iCloud question or would it be better to try to keep evolving questions as a first inclination on the site?

(and yes, I know that finding a general rule is hard since there are always exceptions, but I'm interested in people's experience on other sites to see if we want to tend to handle these one way or another)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we want to handle MobileMe questions? (In general)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe this shows that anything that depends on an external server can stop working any time the host company decides to turn off the server. Thus, all questions about any program that does not work without ongoing support from its company of origin are too localized, and should be closed and deleted from the site. b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5O_O and ^_~ as the kids say these days...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course if the kids are saying that, I have no idea what they mean.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`O_O` is wide open eyes.

Your answer was flagged as being "low quality". In responding to the flag as a moderator, I disagreed that it was low quality (it was correct and on-target), but it did have plenty of room for improvement, so I responded to the flag by attaching the post notification inviting more explanation. The flag was automated. My response was human, but it was from a rather limited set of menu choices. While "subjective" is indeed not the issue at hand, the article linked does have some suggestions about how to improve upon short posts.

In the future, you don't need to think of that as an invitation to delete your post. If you or someone else come back and expand your answer, that is a wonderful thing. If no one does over the course of a few months, we will try to come back and either delete or improve such posts, but there really is a window here, and while you are welcome to improve the post yourself, it isn't all up to you. If you start a good answer, someone else can extend it. If you delete it, it is no longer there for the community to build on.

The language of the standard notification is perhaps more threatening than I'd like it to be, but we moderators can't change it; it's standardized system-wide.

I thought your answer was a great start; I attached the post notification to encourage either you or someone else to improve on it by explaining more.

I'm sorry this situation worked out the way it did. I was trying to send the message "good start, but we'd love to see more here."

Next to comments there are two options - one is to flag it, the other is an up arrow ("this is a great comment"). Other then letting users know which comments are valuable, do  the up arrows "votes" have any other role?

This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might want to enter the [now removed] second question as a feature request, BTW, although there are some longstanding reasons why I expect it will be turned down.


















The current name of the site - "Ask Different" doesn't make sense for most of people except of some people who remember history of Apple campaigns.

When I first time have seen the reference to the site, I decided, that it's like miscelenious, and didn't understand, why apple related questions do not have designated site. I've spend  an hour finding and reading different discussions about how/why the name was chosen( including  https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/205/official-site-title/Official Site Title, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9/domain-name-suggestions/Domain name suggestions, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/write-an-elevator-pitch-taglineWrite an Elevator Pitch / Tagline )

They didn't convinced me that the name is obvious for most of users.

On http://stackexchange.com/siteshttp://stackexchange.com/sites page most site names are self- explanatory, except of Ask Different ( and StackOverflow itself). 
It shows just "Ask Different" and a meaningless for me sign. User has to select the box to see subtitle, explaining what the site is about.

There is currently no explanation of the name on https://apple.stackexchange.com/abouthttps://apple.stackexchange.com/about neither on https://apple.stackexchange.com/faqhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/faq.

 (Can the  explanation be added, if rename of the site will be postponed/ not implemented?)

I am fully agree with reasons  described in

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/286/ask-different-really-surely-ask-appleAsk Different, really? Surely Ask Apple, why the current name is incorrect.

However the suggested name "Ask Apple" was not good, because the site does not a support from Apple company.

I am suggesting  to rename the site  as "Apple User " (similar to Super User). I understand that it's sounds like a major change, but re-branding often a good thing. It was wise to leave URL unchanged, when change of the name was done.https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/433/please-change-name-of-site-from-apple-to-ask-differentPlease change name of site from "Apple" to "Ask Different".

When voting for my suggestion, please consider that the name should be meaningful for thousands of new users, not only for people, who familiar with the current site and Apple history.

Name is confusing for NEW members, for people, who do search or wants to ask the first Apple related question and don't know, that Apple related site exist. I agree, that once I learn the purpose of the site, i can accept the name. But this learning exercise for every new person could be easily avoided just by having more intuitive name. 

My suggestion is to folow KISS principle, avoid extra step of translation (in particular for new users) that Different means Apple.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5​Rename the site as Apple Userb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You've been a member of the site for **five** days, you haven't asked or answered a single question on the site, and you're proposing renaming it? A proposal to rename "Ask Different" might be appropriate someday, but the proposal and name need to come from the community. I'd invite you to participate in the community for a while, and then revisit the question of how the name is working out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a clear explanation of what the site is for virtually everywhere the name is shown. In the logo, which is on every page in the site, Ask Different is followed by 'Answers for your Apple questions'. The very first line of the About page describes the site as 'Q&A for power users of Apple hardware and software.' That description is also shown on the SE sites page. Since the topic of this site is abundantly obvious from those descriptions and the site's content itself, I believe that having a unique, memorable name is more important than having an obvious, forgettable one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont.) It doesn't matter if everyone remembers the Think Different campaign; it just matters that they understand what the site is for, which they will (see above). It does matter that they remember our site specifically, and a unique name helps with that. Plus, 'Ask Different' will be a nice nod to the old pros who have been Apple users for a long time. I really don't see the downside of the current name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have more problems with the strap line that the name.  This place is most definitely not 
*just* a place for power users, there are heap plenty off the street Joe Bloggs who ask the most basic of questions with incessant regularity.  Besides, how can an iPod have a "Power User"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe Jailbreakers ;). Daniel: Nathan: Surely those should have been answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson, I am a member of the site for 5 days, and it's my main point. Name is confusing for NEW members, for people, who do search or wants to ask the first Apple related question and don't know, that Apple related site exist. I agree, that once I learn the purpose of the site, i can accept the name. But this learning exercise for every new person could be easily avoided just by having more intuitive name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NathanGreenstein, http://stackexchange.com/sites shows just "Ask Different" and sign, that is meaningless for me. I have to select the box to see subtitle. My suggestion is to KISS, avoid extra step of translation, that Different means Appleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just as a side note, I didn't get the Think Different joke until many months after I joined the Ask Different community. When I found Ask Different, it was not hard to know that it was about Apple products. There was no confusion as to what the topic of the site was for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MichaelFreidgeim Not anymore. http://i.imgur.com/JXgnk.pngb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No more obtuse than "SuperUser" (this isn't common language for regular computers users) or "ServerFault" (why would I associate that with asking questions about server administration) or "StackOverflow" (again, not straightforward that it's a site for programming questions). The meta-data guides search results sufficiently well, I don't think we need to muck with the name. But maybe drop the "power users" from the byline.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. You can guess from the name that Super User is for power users and Server Fault should be fixed by system and network administrators.  
StackOverflow has become a recognizable name, and is not associated with particular program error.The site is known because it's useful, not because it has the StackOverflow name, that some people consider non-boring and catchy.  
 You can't quess why Different means Apple without knowing particular sloganb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MichaelFreidgeim I think you're applying 20/20 hindsight vision when you call them "guessable". I'll argue they're not guessable until you've explored the sites to understand their charters. Similar to Ask Different.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a good point.  It's an example of not being friendly to new users.


















I apologize for continuing to stir the pot (... kind of), but here's why I figure that the suggestion of the new name is silly:

Programming User
Admin User
Super User
Android User
Apple User
Parent User (User Parenting?)
Math User
Database User
Game Player
Ubuntu User
English Speaker
Wordpress User

That's pretty much what I feel the chain of logic being employed here, is, and it's really nonsensical. Not to even mention that the name Super User doesn't come from etymology similar to "Power User", the name Super User comes from the unix command su which escalates your privileges to root, the "super user" of the system.

The name Super User was a cute play on words that iconifies talented (unix) system administrators. I'm sure there are plenty of Windows users, admins, etc., in the world that miss the point of the joke ENTIRELY, but that's ok. Windows questions to the extent their FAQ describes are still completely on-topic and relevant for Super User.

What's about "Ask about Apple"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In addition to the comment I just left on Nathan's answer which applies here as well, why should we switch to a direct (yes) but boring and forgettable (so much yes) name? Frankly, hearing people reference learning about something on "Ask Different" just feels better than hearing "I learned on Ask About Apple that you can create a [...]". Compare: "I learned on Ask Different that you can create a [...]". Apple has their name for their community forums, Apple Discussions. I feel we should avoid the word 'Apple' for this and many other reasons.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@R.M. "Apple questions" will be good.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Super User may be a play on `su` but as I don't view MacUser as nonsensical or silly, I can't view Apple User as nonsensical or silly.

I believe the canonical sites that are not on the trilogy (and the newly promoted arquade) all are intended to be branded with the stack exchange name for several reasons.


less work (there are like 82 sites all told)
better cohesiveness in search engine eyes as well as overall site traffic
less cost for software / naming that goes by domain


Search on the https://meta.stackoverflow.com/main meta and here for more of the back story...

All of the non-trilogy sites use .SE domains. In a http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/06/welcome-to-the-arqade/post on the SO blog, these reasons are listed (emphasis mine):


  There are a lot of benefits to being associated with the Stack
  Exchange network! That’s why Arqade, Ask Different, and Seasoned
  Advice (among others) all redirect to a ___.stackexchange.com
  subdomain, even though they have their own brands.  For one, search
  rank is improved for our entire network.  Additionally, many people
  recognize Stack Exchange as a brand, and might be more likely to visit
  some of the smaller sites because of that.


That said, I don't think that having the established, uniquely-branded sites on their in domains would necessarily be a bad idea.

I will. Just as a note, I did the same thing, and a fix was issued, and I deleted the post. Just so you know I'd do the same thing to my post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is not a topic of debate. I think it should be there for community awareness as it is bug as you can see in screen shot.

And the winner of our Grand Prize Challenge is... https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1035/houbysofthoubysoft!

Thanks to everyone who participated, and I hope you enjoyed the contest. Winners will be contacted via email to arrange prize shipping.



http://www.apple.com/osx/Mountain Lion is the next major iteration of Apple's OS, and it was officially released today. To celebrate, we are holding a contest with lots of chances to win Apple products, including a grand prize package worth upwards of $500!



To win, do as you always do! Ask and answer awesome questions about https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mountain-lionmountain-lion. There will also be an opportunity to win prizes by writing posts for the http://apple.blogoverflow.com/Ask Different Blog. 

For rules and more details, see the http://mountainlionchallenge.com/Mountain Lion Challenge page.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mountain Lion Challenge - ask, answer, blog and win Apple products!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The [List all new OS X Mountain Lion features](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57349/please-share-new-features-which-you-have-discovered-in-os-x-mountain-lion) question seems like it'll game this contest hard, if [the previous iterations](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) are to judge. Could CW questions be excepted from this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm inclined to agree that CW should be excluded. It seems unfair to reward one person for something that's designed to be a community collaboration.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree also. The poster of the CW question being discussed made similar comments in chat this morning; I don't suspect this policy would draw any complaints if we excluded CW.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also think that CW posts should be excluded. They distort the challenge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is CW? Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5CW stands for Community Wiki.  The reason they would like it excluded is because the questions are usually vague, like: What are some great hidden features in Mountain Lion.  They usually get a huge amount of up votes and the answers in them get them too, see example: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/82/24141 People would like them excluded because they aren't like the regular questions that people ask on here. And someone could win this contest easily with this kind of CW question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good points. I'll think about how best to deal with this in the future. I don't want to go back and make people ineligible who have already completed the ML challenges, so I'm going to leave it in for this contest. Keep in mind that we are doing a raffle though - so while people may earn entries from a CW question, the huge amount of upvotes won't give them an unfair advantage (i.e., there's no advantage to going higher once you get 10 upvotes, or 1000 views, etc)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lauren Do keep in mind that three of the four people who requested this policy are three of the four people who qualified for the drawing on the basis of that post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5w00t :) congrats guys! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So when i will get my gift?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Vivart if you haven't gotten it yet, please send me an email with your order information and full name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question is closed since the relevant promotion is over and that code inactive.


















I favor to exclude CW posts from the mountainlionchallengeTM as it distorts the results.

On Ask Different posts are made community wikis mostly because:


multiple people worked on an answer but only one get's the votes
collect gems which Apple hides in their software


Excluding CW posts will encourage communal editing to provide the best answers and hints without giving some people an unfair head start in the challenge.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And, in point of fact, all the posts that have already qualified for the contest as of 24 hours after the announcement are related to one particular Community-Wiki question. A good case for excluding CW posts from the contest.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would support this as well since CW as it exists now is to allow people to ask "the obvious" and not have it skew reputation or points.


















I'm writing a Blog Post (one that I always intended to write), and it's going to be more than 750 Characters - is this OK?  It's not massively over, it will be approaching a thousand words.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It should be fine. The upper limit is meant to dictate the kind of scope we're interested in rather than be a hard cutoff. Feel free to run your draft by us in the [blog chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1408/ask-different-blog).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, and when I say 750 characters, I mean WORDS!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Twitter has warped our thinking.


















No, on Stack Exchange sites like this one there is no simple way for ordinary users to see who has voted on a post.

While it would sometimes be fun to know who gave you an up/down vote, anonymized voting is important as it allows people to vote based on the post itself without worrying about maintaining friendships or not offending anyone.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see.  That's very clear now.  Thanks!


















As retina displays are http://www.apple.com/iphone/becoming http://www.apple.com/ipad/more http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/pervasive in Apple hardware, and we're here to support users of Apple products, I think it would be great if the AD site included retina versions of its image resources, such as the header image, voting buttons, and user profile photos.

https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/?id=602This WWDC talk has info about how to achieve this. There are several choices for detecting retina displays, including CSS @media queries and window.devicePixelRatio.

This might give you an idea of how it looks without retina graphics:



(Only slightly relevant but fun: http://jsfiddle.net/fy7Fn/AD logo I made with pure CSS.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retina graphics for Ask Different?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apparently I don't have Myriad Pro on my system. So the logo doesn't quite look the same. Otherwise, neat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JasonSalaz the logo should be the same for you, since it's just an image.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin he's referring to the CSS logo linked at the bottom of my post (which depends on the Myriad Pro font).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jtbandes ah ok. I missed that part.


















For users with the new MacBook Pro with retina display, screenshots have their dimensions doubled. For example, if I take a screenshot of a window, this is what I get:



As you can see, when the image is displayed normally, it's too big.

The correct way to display these is to use

<img src="[url]" width="[half of image width]">


Which produces this:



On a retina display, this is rendered at native resolution; on a non-retina display, it's appropriately downscaled so that it remains the correct size.

Can we get a checkbox on the image upload dialog that does the hard work for us? This would make answering questions a lot easier without having to manually check the image width, divide by 2, and type in the HTML.

Something like this:


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Checkbox to automatically resize a retina display screenshotb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, yes, yes and yes - I would love this. Please consider asking this on the main meta http://meta.stackoverflow.com/ - your wording and explanation are excellent. I'll gladly ask it there (taking your work) if you would prefer not to ask there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can no longer migrate questions older than a few weeks to a new site. Someone has to copy the text and ask it thereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Thought I had done this earlier but apparently not. Anyway, here we go! http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/161111/checkbox-to-automatically-resize-a-retina-display-screenshot


















Thanks for raising this. My initial reaction is the site would be served by this opening again (well at least better served than my "notorious" tiny things in Lion question. Let's see what others think. The why some programs fail on case might be illuminating. 

I almost think a pair of questions to keep each straight 


problem children on case-sensitive
problem children on case-insensitive


Any comments on this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As two mods have not objected to the opening - let's open it up and see how the community steps up. Let's count on @mankoff to pick the vision (one place for several CW answers listing each OR edit it to ask for one and perhaps ask another for the converse (case+ and case-).


















After looking at this again I think it could be opened.

I don't completely remember my reasoning for closing it initially, but my guess is that I was worried that it would become a maintenance issue like the huger 'list of apps' wikis and I didn't think that it had a wide enough appeal to justify that kind of overhead.

But, after taking a second look, I think the question could be answered well with two big answers, one for each category (issues with case sensitive vs insensitive) containing a list of apps (like the https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/23660/2220Genius Mixes answer), which would be an effective way to collect the info and not nearly as much of a maintenance issue.

Or, as Mike suggests, this could be split into two distinct questions each with its own wiki answer.

How would you feel about reopening with a plan of doing something like that?

Thanks for bringing this up, and sorry for being perhaps too quick to close initially!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK sounds good. I propose keeping one question. It is limited scope enough that two might spread it too thin. For example, there is only one program I am currently aware of that requires HSFX. So maybe it is 1 question: "HSFX Problems"? As for 1 big list like the Genius Mix, that is one approach. But if someone can provide code samples to get something working (http://www.jms1.net/osx-case-sensitive-fs.shtml), wouldn't that be useful? And therefore each program warrants its own answer. Why is this a maintenance nightmare?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See the comments above - even before things reach nightmare level, there is a downside to large questions. Moderating a question with three or more pages of answers is quite time consuming and we like to be open about why certain "rules" or habits exist so that we're being fair to all questions in a category (wiki - like) as well as this one in particular.


















I clicked https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#dontaskWhat shouldn't I ask here? and was puzzled by no mention of jailbreaking, NDA and so on.

Later I realised that a separate section – What can I ask here? – includes a list of things that should not be asked. At least:

… refrain from asking about ...

Apple Developer Programs or iTunes Connect (including iAd and the iBookstore)
programming, with the exception of AppleScript and Automator
installing or using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware
a shopping or buying recommendation for hardware
pre-release or beta software (We consider versions not available to the public to be - in this category)
obtaining or using pirated software or media

… beta, pre-release, and general developer questions that might be covered with a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) …


Arranging things in that way, in the two subsections of the FAQ, is counterintuitive. Nots and nons are currently misclassified as can-dos.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#dontaskWhat kind of questions should I not ask here? should list:

refrains (the nots)
stuff that might be subject to nondisclosure (the nons).

Summary
This meta question is:

about arrangement of points within the FAQ page
not about removal of points.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5faq#ask should not include points that belong under faq#dontaskb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could you clarify what you'd like to see so I can determine if this needs to be fielded here or on the main meta? I'll make an answer based on my understanding of the situation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @bmike. At least some of the six points seem Apple-specific.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed - I presume you are not calling for removal of the specific things we discourage but for it's relocation.


















Have there been any comments or links or conversation of this being confusing to actual newcomers? (Or are you placing yourself in their shoes?)

I think this banner is a very good way to ensure everyone who visits knows that we are actively seeking participation from newcomers - especially if they have arrived here for reasons other than Mountain Lion launch. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Confusing for me sometimes, and I'm familiar with the site, which is why I began thinking about newcomers. Certainly the banner is a good way of raising awareness but its placement in the **midst** of a question can be troublesome.


















Here is how the FAQ works today.

All sites on Stack Exchange (87 full and another 52 beta) currently have static content for the FAQ and a very small section that can be customized for a specific site.

By design, we can only customize this top section.

Here's what could be done today:


Delete all the site specific guidance on what not to ask (if the confusion of having it it two places was seen to be worse than having it in the FAQ)
Ask on the main meta to allow sites to customize the "don't ask" portion as well as the "ask" portion.


I feel strongly that our customized "do not ask" information needs to be in the FAQ and thus would support keeping it there until such a time that #2 is possible for us to accomplish.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Total agreement that a shortlist of questions to **not** ask does belong somewhere in the primary FAQ page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect. You could leave this question here and see if a similar question has been asked on the main meta (or ask it yourself there) so that the main meta question could see how one site is working around this limitation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Groovy. This answer alone is acceptable to me (personally) but I'll leave the question open indefinitely for other meta bods to consider at their leisure. If/when a `status-completed` time approaches, ping me here or in chat and I'll tidy up.


















We have plans to update all the icons for SE sites to retina at some point. It will be a lengthy process. We're still deciding on which icons have higher priority. The obvious ones are the logo and voting arrows/favstar.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could Ask Different act as a testbed for these changes? It would be only appropriate :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It certainly would make the most sense for AD to get them first :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do voting buttons even have to be images? Maybe on other sites but not on this one. There are characters that match the buttons and can be manipulated with CSS color, gradient, and shadow properties. ▲ ▲ ▼ ▼ ◀ ► ◀ ► you know the rest.

I suppose for consistency's sake you would need them all to be images, or all to be characters, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you look at the html structure, each arrow is a single anchor. also, we can't use ▲/▼ as the anchor text due to screen reader issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Using unicode symbols tends to cause issues of rendering different on different systems, depending on the font substitution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin any update on the work towards updating the images for SE sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now that I'm using the site on a retina MBP, I really, really, really am a huge fan of the work being done incrementally. The controls that get used hundreds of times and the thin lines being drawn on review panes, mod tools and such are gorgeous. I appreciate the structural work being done even though not all icons are 2x yet.


















The definition of the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/icalical tag is:


  Apple's calendar application, bundled with every Mac OS X install


Whereas the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/calendarcalendar tag is:


  A calendar is visual representation of time, often charted by months, weeks, or days. Often, a calendar app will help one organize events on a calendar, and sometimes provide alerts or reminders as well.


However, with the advent of Mountain Lion (and, indeed, even with iOS for a while now), Calendar is the name of the iCal application.  I imagine Apple's intent is to phase out the use of the name iCal as it homogenizes the platforms.

The same is true of the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/address-bookaddress-book tag:


  Apple's built-in contacts manager software for Mac OS X.


vs. the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contactscontacts tag:


  Information stored on a computer about various methods to contact a person, such as e-mail, various chat networks, telephone, physical address, etc.


Contacts is now the name of the Address Book application.



I imagine that simply merging the tags isn't a workable solution, as questions previously tagged with https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/calendarcalendar or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contactscontacts aren't guaranteed to actually be referring to the formerly-named iCal or Address Book applications.

Going forward, however, new users on Mountain Lion and iOS devices will probably be less and less familiar with the terms iCal and Address Book.  How should the community address this with the tags?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags: iCal vs. Calendar, Address Book vs. Contactsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe the solution is to develop a time machine so all users are familiar with all the old technologies and terms. Apple ][ Forever!


















User asked a question about a specific problem, I gave him a specific answer based on my experience and it got voted down?

https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/28446/12418https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/28446/12418
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was this answer down-voted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that after posting this it moved from -2 up to 0, but I think the question is still valid. Down votes for reasonable answers drive people away.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I had this question downvoted: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64235/how-can-i-play-an-audio-file-on-intial-startup-of-macbook-pro From a user perspective how are we supposed to learn how to write a better question if there is no guidance as to why question was down voted? I think it's important to offer some sort of direction as to why a particular question is down voted so a user can re-write,expand or clarify a question. Anonymous down voting is obviously the way to go, but down voting with not direction, not so much.


















The same way it has for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mailmail and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mail.appmail.app.

We create https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contacts.appcontacts.app and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/calendar.appcalendar.app. The tag could be used for both iOS and OS X.

I don't think a synonym should be set between for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/icalical => https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/calendar.appcalendar.app and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/address-bookaddress-book => https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contacts.appcontacts.app, since Mountain Lion is not the majority OS, yet.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The .app tags seem sensible, but I don't really see the problem in making a synonym straight away.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's worth pointing out the workaround, which is to use two tags.  (mac + calendar) almost certainly refers to whatever the mac calendar app is called, regardless if it's "iCal" or "Calendar".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to necropost here by saying that there's also [tag:apple-watch] and [tag:apple-watch.app]


















In the first example, subject to more review, it sounds like the tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/groupgroup is better off being deleted. Tags are not intended to be so specific. The group-conversation question is better off under something like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagingmessaging, the rest should simply drop the tag.

It's not a matter of 'allowing' ambiguous tags, it's a matter of allowing users to fill in almost anything into the field provided they have https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/create-tags300+ rep, and cleanup only happens after the fact. The tag suggestions pop-up helps, only if the tag itself previously exists, has a description, and the user chooses to read it.

If you mean a technical policy wherein the user is brought to a tag-edit dialog immediately after their post their question, that is worse. Things like that drive users away from a site. And they can always close the window or click another link to bypass the screen.

I don't believe a policy of forcing users that create a tag to explicitly define it will help, primarily because when a user is focused on something like the content of their question, they'd likely describe the tag specific to their situation. There are a wide variety of cases such as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mailmail where it applies to a handful of scenarios. The user could choose to talk explicitly about OS X Mail.app, or iOS Mail.app, when in reality it applies to any mail client, web mail sites, the act of transmitting mail, etc.

Bad data is just as bad, if not worse, than no data. I feel that the non-♦ users contributing tag edits lately are doing a great job maintaining quality. With the addition of the approval system to squeeze out the best possible improvements before approval, tags that are being maintained are consistently achieving high quality.

Just one thing: I don't think I said "window-management" was too broad for my second example. I said that it was a fitting tag because it was "a little more general [then "group"] but not too broad". Anyway, thanks, I now understand better the tagging system.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I see. Yeah, English is weird and sometimes I just read it in the wrong direction. This was one of those cases. I've edited the relevant paragraph out of the post since I just plain agree with it.


















It was down-voted because somebody with at least 125 reputation points decided to cast a downvote. Really, that's all we can know.

Voting is anonymous, and voters don't need to explain their votes. Voting against an answer removes two reputation points from the person who receives the vote and removes one reputation point from the person who casts the vote, so whoever decides to vote against an answer is sacrificing some of their own reputation to do so.

Your answer could have been down-voted because someone thought your content was irrelevant. It could have been down-voted because someone wanted to up-vote it, but clicked the wrong button. It could have been down-voted because someone was having a bad day and took it out on your post. Because votes are anonymous, unless the voter choses to explain her/his vote, we don't know more than that.

There are many down-votes with which I disagree, but even the moderators don't see who casts them or know why they were cast.

This question, set up in a "one program per response" format, is a recipe for disaster. Unless the answers very closely track version numbers, (e.g. Widget.app version 5.0.2 doesn't work with Mountain Lion), it very quickly becomes obsolete, which is worse than not having an answer at all.

Additionally, voting for individual answers doesn't accomplish anything meaningful. If Dragon Express gets two votes and Screenflow 2.1 gets six, does that mean that people miss Screenflow more? People think it's more broken? It happened to be posted first?

On the other hand, setting up the question so it attempts to produce one comprehensive single answer that is a list of all known ML incompatibilities and encourages other posters to add to that answer — that approach would fit into the site format better, but in this case, it's still likely to become outdated very quickly.

While there might be a version of this question that is workable, you haven't found it yet. Which is all the more reason it needs to be closed until it gets edited into workable form — it's much harder to fix it up once there's a stream of answers already in place.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll note as a result of the discussion in chat, closed questions can still be edited. If you, Jamie, find an acceptable form of the question, I have zero qualms in reopening it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm afraid even in the best-case scenario, any answer to this question would be "too localized" — likely to become outdated rather quickly, and thus not useful in the future.


















I've tried to the best of my knowledge to contribute to the StackExchange community with each question, thinking that the answer may help a countless number of other users in the future. I can't tell you how many times I've run across a StackExchange question in a Google search that gave me the exact answer to the problem I was having. It's certainly an invaluable service and I like to think that I'm giving something back by asking questions and helping others while I'm waiting for the answer.

That being said, I haven't had any questions voted down until this one. I thought I had a legitimate question about an iPad video issue. My problem was that I wanted to watch a video of a certain program on my iPad, but the video was only available in Flash format. I wanted to know if there were any apps or websites that would support this video on iPad. I thought other users with the same experience would be able to give me a tip on another place to look.

In any case, I'd like to avoid asking bad questions in the future, so please give me a few tips on why my question may have been voted down -- and how to improve similar questions in the future. Thanks for any pointers.

My Question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/60210/how-can-i-watch-old-episodes-of-nova-on-my-ipadHow can I watch old episodes of Nova on my iPad?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my question about watching videos on iPad voted down?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"flash" http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/


















Unless someone that voted down your answer sees this question (statistically uncommon), you're not likely to get a straight answer.

My two cents from skimming over the question;

The general quality and tone of it is fine. Minus a few grammar gripes (two periods), the quality of the question itself is perfectly acceptable.

Maybe the question comes off as a bit of a rant? "$3.99 per episode is too expensive". When a single song is $0.99, surely TV content should be more, but not too much more. I don't disagree with you, except to recommend you see if they have a season pass which could offer you a nice discount. Plus, iTunes is commonly the cheapest you'll find this content for, anywhere. (Barring maybe Amazon? Not sure.)

It might have also been voted down as a knee jerk response to the voter assuming "this guy is asking for links to free downloads of the series". I'm perfectly aware that this is not the case, but I'm just guessing what other people might have thought.

Combine the above with your low rep and lack of a username, and people tend to jump on the "this new person doesn't know how this site works yet" bandwagon.

Don't be distraught. If you get a better answer to your question, perfect. If you don't? I'll just be glad to continue seeing you around the site. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I second the sentiment to encourage you to engage with the site and keep asking questions to see which are useful to others (in addition to being of use to you). The beauty of the site is that even unpopular questions are allowed and kept when answers are made that get support. There is no suppression of questions in search until they get deleted. Even closed questions are visible in search results while they have a chance to get edited and re-opened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your answer. I initially thought I was breaking a rule or doing something wrong when I received the four down votes. (The $3.99 comment was just in comparison to the programs being available for free on the Nova website.) I think feedback in any form is helpful, but just wish they had left a response if they thought there was a way I could improve the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Breaking a rule would result in question closure/deletion.


















I think Jason has covered 90% of the potential for downvotes, but I could also see people down voting on the usefulness of the question for future visitors.

Questions that are scavenger hunts or lists tend to do poorly since they don't involve the answerer getting into "why" and instead just point to "there it is".

In this case Nova spends a lot of money making content and has chosen a certain distribution model. You are implying that you don't value the content in the same way as them and seek an end/around in how you worded the question.

In the end - several possible answers are possible to a question like the one you have asked:


You weren't aware of an alternate official source of the content and someone points you to it.
You weren't aware of public statement of plans to release the content in the manner you wish to see it and someone points you to it.
Someone re-encodes the content and makes it available and someone (else) points you to it.
An answer shows you how to re-encode the files and you DIY.


Only the last scenario seems to involve knowledge that typically gets up votes. Your question clearly isn't a bad one, but it may not become a popular one. Since voting is anonymous, even moderators can only see the total vote count so at present it's +2/-4 and without a comment the reason for the voting can only be guessed. 

In this specific case, perhaps if you had contacted Nova and asked them if they have plans and summarized that response here - people would find that of more use than the question as it currently is worded...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great points and I appreciate the feedback. My question originally had a -4 which is what prompted me to ask this forum. I'll take your advice into consideration for my next questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Certainly stay with it - once people see a few questions and answers in your voice, I believe you will find this a very welcoming place open to many ways to look at an issue.


















You could award the bounty to an answer you find more helpful. Otherwise, no.  Do note that an answer that you find useless might help someone else. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So other than selecting one of the other answers, I'm stuck with the bad one, correct?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this case I'm pretty sure that what's gong in is that people aren't completely testing the answer. I have the same behavior as the answer describes, but over time, the "solution" wears off. If it's "helping", it's actually misleading.


















The bounty is spent to get premium attention and nothing more.

You get to choose among any of the answers to award the bounty and you can choose to not award it. The choice is yours.

Do note that if you fail to award the bounty (which it totally separate than voting up or down any answer and also is decoupled from accepting an answer), it may go to the highest voted (but must have +2 or more net votes) answer that came after you added the bounty. 

Don't worry if there is no recent answer with enough votes as in this case, no answer will even get the "half share" of bounty if the system can award it according to the process.

More details on this are here:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/set-bountieshttps://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/set-bounties


So, by definition - no useless answer can ever get bounty if you award it to another answer and the system will deem a +2 answer useful and award half points if no other answer is better and the points are still unawarded at the end of your 24 hour grace period to award the points once the promotion period ends.

In the end, it's not really possible to directly affect voting other than being gracious and understanding that there are many points of view and sometimes you'll need to take the feedback and edit the question a month down the road and clarify what you are seeking (or just ask a new question that more clearly sets down your particular use case.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I guess patience is in order (clearly my frantic commenting isn't doing much good).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's good to be passionate - but sometimes too much passion can hide the bare facts. There's a lot of chance to using a bounty - but you've also got experience now so you can be more happy with it the next time you want to promote a question.


















The stack exchange developers have been working hard on making the tools for reviewing content by trusted users better to allow the community to keep things clean, clear and free of spam and other disruptive content.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/

I wanted to make a place to discuss any site-specific comments or concerns and also to encourage everyone to check out the new tools and send feedback either here or on the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/review?sort=newestmain meta by using the review tag.

Here are some tips for successful hunting:


It's OK to close any question that needs time, editing or clarification to prevent it from getting voted out of existence. I expect the tools to have a reopen queue at some point, but you can always flag a question for reopening if you feel it's in better shape after a closure.
Review is not a race. Questions in review have already had that "something isn't quite right" flag or vote and it's up to you to pause and reflect to see how best to fix things. The NOT SURE button is your friend. It doesn't take the question out of review so err on that if you are at all unsure.
Thank you for making the site a better place for all. Be critical, but be civil when reviewing. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-is-not-a-forum-the-role-of-niceness-on-a-qa-site/Civility is not necessarily synonymous with niceness, but when you can pull off both, so much the better.


As our site grows, having many eyes improving the quality of the questions, comments and answers will allow us to continue to grow into the best place on the internet for Apple hardware and software questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please let us know how the new review tools are workingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Affixing the tools at the top is nice. But the space it takes is HUGE on my built-in display (900 pixels high).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These are way easier to use than the old tools. I might actually start using the review button again.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Were stats reset on the beta? For example, this shows empty for me http://apple.stackexchange.com/review-beta/low-quality-posts/history


















Now that I recently got access to more of the review tools, I really like the new stuff, more than the older.


I feel like there is more presence on an 'action' to do. As in, what you could work on.
I like the better access to history, as in, what you did work on (I learn many things while reviewing and want to go back)


I do feel a few things could be added to make it even better (very minor too)


I would like to be able to see how many current close votes there are for an issue. I usually judge an issue by how I feel about it, so would vote to close regardless. But if there are several others already voting, I would like to see the count.
I would also like to see the 'flag' tool. As being someone who can't handle flags, I still would like to  be able to flag an answer to go into the higher-ranked mods queues. For example, under 'Low Quality', I could hit Recommend Deletion, but is that all 'Flag' means?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On each review item, you can open the link on the right to get the normal view and flag things. As a new reviewer - go ahead and flag a handful of borderline issues and comment how you feel it should be handled and ask for a moderator to comment back / confirm. We can then reply to you in cases where you're not sure of how to handle things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The count for close votes is intentionally hidden (AFAIK). As humans, we have a hard time being objective when we see a pack forming or to defer to another name based on past experience. Give each question a fresh look and you'll know in time if others feel the same or if you were the one to cast the fifth close vote when it is revealed who all voted to close it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thats what I thought of both, they are not shown due to that. But with flagging, it feels like I have to take an extra step if that's the option I want to take, make sense?


















The colors should be changed. I can't see what is written. That yellow and white color make it impossible to read. It can be read but you need to select the text with your cursor.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Warning pop-up is difficult to readb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That color contrast is quite hard to see for me as well. I'll mark this as a bug / design so that the developers can track this request. Anyone who agrees with this suggestion should upvote it so we can know it's a popular request. Thanks all...


















When reviewing the Low Quality Posts, it'd be nice to see other answers. If there's an answer with just a link with no description, I'll edit it if it's the only answer, but if there's another answer with the same info, I'd just recommend for deletion.

I'm still sorta new to the politics of meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - the choice of what to show clearly is a site-wide decision so the main meta would be the best place to weigh in on this specific topic. It's great to link to the relevant question here so people can follow it - but I'm thinking site specific discussion can stay here and only here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Asked: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/144259/see-other-answers-in-low-quality-posts Sorry it took so long.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome - context is key ;-)


















Roll it back and add a comment as to why you prefer your wording or better, make a second edit to keep the good and further refine things you feel could be made better. 

In your specific case, I edited it quite severely since it was a rant and they get flagged and closed more often than not, but as the author of the post you generally get extra leeway in how a post reads. Who cares if people are livid - the emotional state of others on a chat board or even one person's frustration rarely add value to a question on the site so we do edit out rants as a point of policy. I did leave in the "livid" part to indicate that you were frustrated and chose those words to characterize this function and your view of it.

Since the site is https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#editingedited collaboratively - you should expect a back and forth as well as be open to what the regulars consider "good form" when you are new to a particular site.

It was on the heavy end of edits for sure but we get hundreds of "apple sucks - why did they do this stupid thing" and I honestly didn't want your name colored into that category. It's a great question. I did take a second edit at your title - I hope the last edit captures your main intent better.

Both https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/1346/jason-salazJason Salaz and I have tested this in Chrome and do not see the clipping. To isolate the issue, can you try making a new user account on your Mac and try seeing if Chrome there has the same issue? You also will want to try disabling any extensions or user scripts you have if it's not just a bad render as your browser changes the font size larger and smaller. The new account will help with getting back to the Chrome default fonts and sizes as well as not have any content cached.

After experimenting with the new review features, I have to say that I dislike them compared to the old interface for "low quality posts". In the review interface, moderators don't have a link to the mod tools, so we can post a comment that an answer ought to be a comment, but can't click the mod button to convert the answer to a comment. The new interface is thus less powerful than the old one that it replaces.

I do like that it is prompting us to revisit old posts, some of which were tagged with post notices months ago. Since post notices often warn that posts will be deleted if not fixed, some future mechanism to revisit these notices (either this or automatically flagging posts with post notices x months later to see if the notice should be removed, or else the post should be deleted) is a good thing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the mod button is a work in progress. It's in place for some of the new review tools, but doesn't really work yet on Safari. As to the delete later - are you referring to answers or questions with the annotation?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Answers were what I had in mind. The whole "this response will be deleted if it isn't improved" warning in the post notices would be a lot more believable if affixing such a notice set a timer to autoflag the post for review after a reasonable interval to see if the problem has been fixed.


















Something I've seen quite a bit of while reviewing Low Quality Posts: obviously incorrect/irrelevant answers. (Case in point: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1097/can-i-hide-the-keyboard-on-my-iphone-4-the-way-you-can-on-the-ipad/4013#4013this answer.) 

What is the recommended approach to this? The answer is almost two years old and the answerer isn't even a member of Ask Different (so they're not likely to come back and fix it). I fixed the grammar (which wasn't [relatively] all that bad to begin with), and noted that it was completely irrelevant (it referenced Messages, not Mail) in a comment.

What is the "best" option in the review options? It doesn't "Look Good": it's crap; it doesn't need editing (anymore); and I'd like to delete it, but I'm not sure "utterly irrelevant" is a good reason to delete an answer.

I think you've found a problem with the review page. I've been marking such posts as "no problem" because there is no problem that requires community or moderator action. Inaction is prescribed — don't voting for that post. If one feels particularly strongly and is willing to sacrifice some reputation for it, one could vote the answer down, but that isn't one of the review options. Wrongness certainly doesn't require a flag, and editing a wrong answer to make it right seems like inappropriate over-editing in many cases.

I flagged an https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/61302/4178answer to one of my questions as not answering the question asked. It got declined for lack of evidence. I flagged again stating specifically that it would be better as a comment because, while helpful, still didn't answer the question. It got declined because I mentioned a USB drive, so apparently that's what I was asking, even though I specifically tagged the question as file Sharing and also talked more about that in my question than anything. So, I edited my question to remove the fact that I used a USB drive at all, because it wasn't relevant to what I wanted answered, and then flagged again. It was again declined because flagging an answer is not the way to tell people it doesn't answer the question.

not an answer – Aug 20 at 4:27   declined - a moderator reviewed your flag, but found no evidence to support it
This doesn't answer the question I asked and would be better as a comment than an answer. – 45 mins ago   declined - The answer seems to be a reasonable response to the question, as worded. If the OP only wants an answer about using File Sharing, don't spend most of the question talking about other data transfer.
Question has been edited to be about file share and not USB drive (though I don't know why it became about USB drives in the first place) and this answer would be best as a comment as it doesn't answer my question. – 30 mins ago   declined - flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies, or an altogether wrong answer

Ok, so my problem here is that I read the FAQ and under the section https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#deletionDeletetion it states that an answer that does not fundamentally answer the question is eligible for removal or deletion. And immediately following is the steps to flag a moderator.
If, in my question, I'm not supposed to flag an answer for not fundamentally answering a question, how am I supposed to let a moderator know about it? Pray that I'll be lucky and they see the answer and decide to convert it from answer to comment?
Is the flagging system somehow different here on apple.se than it is on other SE sites?

iTunes for Windows is very much on-topic for this site. iTunes is an Apple product, and many of its users use the Windows version.

If a question asks about iTunes for Mac and the answer comes in about iTunes for Windows, that is obviously a less-helpful answer. Similarly if the question is about iTunes for Windows but the answer is Mac-centric.

The real trick is when the question doesn't specify platform. Many users on this site (myself included) will give Mac-centric answers to a generic question (not on principle but because we forget iTunes for Windows exists!), but that isn't always what the original poster actually wants. So if you're more knowledgable about the Windows version of iTunes, please do contribute to answers that help Windows users.

Otherwise, you (specifically as someone who knows more about Windows than Mac) can do two things to improve the answer:


help improve the QUESTION by commenting to find out if the OP (original poster) is actually looking for a Mac or PC solution
use the expertise make the Windows-side answers as good as possible, and let people who are more familiar with the Mac side of things do the same.

Tags should only exist to help an audience of answerers find the questions they're looking for. I suspect there could exist an actual audience knowledgable about code signing / digital message signing who might be interested in finding and answering questions so tagged.

Maybe there's an audience for Digital Notary sorts of things; I could be persuaded.

There is no need for a signature tag referring to the bits at the end of an e-mail message separate from the tag for the mail program in question; no one is an expert in writing your name and contact information at the end of a message separate from knowing how to use e-mail programs well. If you're trying to figure out how to make program X use the <blink> tag in your signature, you don't need a signature expert, you need either an expert in that program, or in this case, better still, someone to ban you from ever using the internet again because the <blink> tag is evil.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/signaturesignature space doesn't need to be mapped out; it needs to be killed off. Remove the tag from e-mail signatures and make https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-signingcode-signing and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/signaturesignature both point to digital signature. Fewer tags = better.

Unless someone comes along with a compelling argument to keep signature, I'll get a post explaining why and how we'll burninate it.

I see questions pertaining to Apple environments where they questioner is being told to ask in Superuser. Which questions go where? I tried to find guidance on this in the About page, but could not find it.

Superuser is defined as "for computer enthusiasts". Ask Different is for "apple hardware and software."

What about shell commands? That seems to me it fulfills both definitions. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the difference between "Ask Different" and "SuperUser" Stackexchange sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to link to specific advice or questions - we can address them as well, but I'll give you an overview answer that covers the basics.


















You are absolutely correct that there is significant overlap between sites.

We share a large coverage overlap between:


Stack Overflow (for the programming questions we do entertain as well as using developer tools, shell scripting, open source)
Server Fault (for the server side of things)
Super User (for all the computer topics that are on topic here)
Arquade (for questions about Mac games)
Unix, Security, DBA to a lesser extent...


When there is overlap, we simply ask you pick one site to ask your question and be patient if it doesn't get an immediate answer. If you have promoted the question on site A and want to flag it for migration to site B - that is always considered when there is a good reason to move it (unanswered - clearly asked when not aware of another site where there may be more expertise on the specific question). It's more about the unique community that each site has developed that makes the difference where someone might ask a question that is on topic in several sites.

As to specific differences between Ask Different and Super User - the latter is objectively larger, higher traffic and more mature (older). It clearly doesn't want any questions on devices like the iPad, iOS, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone - so a site like this is better when you're looking for that audience. Also hanging out in the chat rooms of both sites will quickly let you gauge the feeling of both communities.

Especially if the question seems that it is in the overlap.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There shouldn't be any contention - ideally. Also - it's up to the asker to pick the site - not the potential answerers. Feel free to flag anything to get a moderator attention on either site if you see spanking - there are edit buttons we're happy to wield if someone strayed to the other side of the "niceness" line.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good to know. The "spank" factor has put me off somewhat. In the future, should it occur in what appears to me to be unjust, I will avail myself of the moderators.

I think the main issue I had when I started using the new review was the amount of older posts appearing in low quality posts, i think the oldest I saw was late 2010.

Obviously for a first time user, you can do something about them or ignore them, and I did both.

Should these be sandboxed on a specific time limit for future users?  I'm wondering if someone gains review privileges and gets a list of all these old posts that have basically been left/ignored.

Similarly, the new review system means there does appear to be a lot of duplication of effort.  I'll look at a post that is still up for review and see that it's already been edited by one of us, with the nice blue banner with the "instructions" for the poster.

I think in some cases it would be good if those edits/changes were visible in the review system (alongside the edit change list), and have a button that says "I agree with this review" to shortcut the time it takes.

We are now clear of all old close votes, low quality posts and of course suggested edits. From now on, the content will be fresh. (At least until the tools grow to add new checks - like first answers, late answers, first questions, etc...) The duplication is intentional since only edits have a single up/down vote to get approved. The rest require several users to act on a close/reopen vote except for diamond moderators that have binding votes.

As mentioned below, SE isn't a discussion forum and we shouldn't try to turn it into one.


















Stack Exchange-proper is not a discussion forum. The design, flow, and purpose behind the site actively dissuades from having extended discussions. You have sufficient rep to join http://chat.stackexchange.comany public chat room.

Yes, chat is often quiet. You're also at a disadvantage as a result of living outside of the US. Stack Exchange is English/US-Centric (with exceptions), and chat very heavily reflects this.

Much of the general reason that chat is quite is because there isn't any meaningful subject of conversation taking place. If we have a reason to talk/answer, we often do. Having said that, it's somewhat of a surprise that the iPhone 5/iOS 6 bump has only barely re-invigorated the chat room. I'm sure that will change as soon as they're released and in people's hands.

We can't promise an answer, but also know chat is asynchronous and well integrated. If you say something when people aren't around, and someone replies to you when they come back to the chat room, you will be notified via your inbox in the top left hand side of nearly all Stack Exchange network pages.

Chat can be asynchronous, and with it's reply tracking you can usually catch up on a conversation and context without too much difficulty.

and was curious why it was closed.

One person mentioned that he considered it a shopping question and that's why he thought it was shut down.  I had assumed since I wasn't asking for a place to buy a product or where I can find good prices, that this would not be considered a shopping question, but maybe I'm wrong.

Are questions about whether there exists equipment that meets specific requirements not appropriate for the Apple SE site? Any guidance for future questions welcome.

I can't answer with a definitive yes, but are you referring to the "2 questions" with new activity item that shows up when your current page is out of date?

The site developers should see this bug report and answer definitively, but we share the majority of the code with all the non-SO sites so it's extremely likely we are coded the same as stack overflow.

The person offering the bounty can award it to any answer - including one that meets your description above. It's an answer, it could be awarded bounty by the person that initiated the bounty (as long as it wasn't their answer too, I presume).

If that fails to happen, the system will not award half the bounty since no answer has two votes (and even if one did have two votes, it would have to arrive after the bounty started for the system to award the points.)

Is there a question you are specifically interested in, or more the mechanics? The bounty is fulfilled since the system promotes the question. The awarding is just a side effect / bonus for the granter and the community if they choose to vote up an answer and the granter doesn't choose to award the bounty.

I've https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46322/what-programs-have-trouble-with-case-sensitive-hfsx-filesystems-and-how-to-fiasked a question on Apple.SE and it was closed. After I successfully argued here that https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1374/requesting-re-open-votes-for-a-questionthe reason for closing was inadequate, the original closer and others agreed it should be re-opened. It was, and accumulated a few more votes and views since then.

I just went back to improve it and add yet another answer (MeshLab.app also breaks on HSFX), and found it was closed as of two weeks ago October 1.

The reason for closing is:

  It's difficult to tell what is being asked here. This question is
  ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and cannot
  be reasonably answered in its current form. For help clarifying this
  question so that it can be reopened, see the FAQ.


Rant: This is, simply, B.S. It is a real question, it is easy to tell what is being asked, it is not ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad (it was previously closed because it was too specific I think). It is not rhetorical, and it is very easy to answer in its current form. 

The question is a specialized question. Is that the problem? Is this site really more interested in questions about how to customize your desktop background, adjust your screen-saver hot-corners, etc.? What exactly is the problem with this question? I'm happy to have it closed and deleted if it is of no use, but based on the number of views, it is a useful question.

Please vote and/or comment if you think it should be re-opened.

I have never voted to close the question, but for whatever it's worth, I don't think the question is a good fit for the site. I do think it's very much on-topic, and the information it contains is relevant for the site, but the question tries to do two different things, one of which the site does quite well and the other one it does less well, but both of them together seem pretty non-optimal.

The question asks for a list of programs that break under case-sensitive file systems. This is a question that could have a correct answer, but it is well-suited to a correct answer that is a single large list, not a bunch of answers, each of which provides one program that breaks under case-sensitive filesystems. So I believe the first part could be salvaged as its own question. The downside to this is that such a list could become inaccurate quickly, depending on how updates to the software change the filesystem requirements. So if we wanted the list question, whoever answered it would need to curate it. This could work, but the site doesn't handle it ideally

The second part asks for workarounds to make these programs work. This is actually a series of very good questions, each of which would be quite on-topic and welcome here on its own. If one work-around could work for all (or many) of the programs, the second part of the question could be a single question. If the fix tends to be program-speficic, this should be a separate question for each program one wants to get working under case-sensitive filesystems.

The fact that a poster is tempted to post more than one answer is the first hint that it might not be a good fit for the Q&A format. The issue is that our system is ideally designed to produce a single "best" answer that the OP can accept as correct. This question asks for some outstanding content, but is far from optimized for this site's Q&A format. I believe it should be restructured (broken into parts), and each of the parts should be very much welcome and on-topic here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi @Daniel. I agree with point 1. This is not well-suited to a single answer. But my highest-rated/viewed/starred question on this site, and many others, have this same issue (see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x) and are still popular and remain open. As for giving each program its own question and answer, because this situation is enough of an edge case, I thought accumulating everything in one place might be better.


















My main objection to this question is that imo the community/Mac users are better served with a generic answer advising them against using a case-sensitive filesystem for installing any Mac application. As it is formulated right now, I fear the question and its answers might only confuse users.

However many apps will be added to this question, the list will never be exhaustive, and it is safe to assume many Mac apps are not thoroughly tested on case-sensitive filesystems, and many future Mac apps still will not be.

There are only very few edge cases where you need or would prefer a CS filesystem on the Mac, and these situations can be addressed without making the main filesystem case-sensitive, by creating a separate partition or using disk images.

I'd wish the question was asked in such a way that it would not sollicit for a plethora of answers, so these generic answers would stand out more.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that since this is an edge case, by definition, anyone who even knows what HSFX is and/or is considering it, knows it will likely cause problems. I think your fear is unfounded. Newbies won't wander into this and switch to HSFX without understanding what they are doing. As for not exhaustive... correct. But is anything ever exhaustive? This site has tons of stale questions because of OS or software bug-fixes & upgrades. What better place to attempt to make an exhaustive list (and serve this edge-case community) than this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have no question that this site is an appropriate place to discuss what breaks with HFSX and how to work around it. My issue is that we find the right way to structure that information in our Q&A format.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's perfectly acceptable to see a question and either comment or just edit it into the shape you feel best expresses the dilemma. This site is collaboratively edited and should the asker have a good point why this isn't the meaining, an edit can be rolled back. You also can propose the better question linking back to the first so that everyone can find the answers - those that like the wiki approach and those more looking for experience to guide them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike That's harder to do once several answers are posted, which in this case happened within minutes of the question going up. Again, I'd say that's a red flag on one's format: if you're tempted to post a question and then immediately post **several** answers, something's wrong with the format for our Q&A.


















I don't think that there is a progress marking for the easier to achieve badges. You can see things on the review tab where the longer to achieve tasks do get progress bars.



So in general, the developers of the site are aware that showing progress is good, however it's hard to know which items they may add features to. By asking here or the https://meta.stackoverflow.com/main meta and making a case for a specific progress bar, you might move the people paying the salaries of the developers to add that item to their work queue.

I personally don't see a burning need to address something as small as the announcer badge. If you work on asking a good question, the views will come. Also the sharing tools for social media will help if you have a question that's close to getting the views needed for that badge.

My question was not about increasing the number of views. It was more a curiosity about the badge progress. Thanks!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect - hopefully it's clear that there isn't a dashboard for all badge progress that any of us can see.


















While retagging https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/58360/8823this question to remove the 'iBooks' tag (which is clearly associated with Apple's e-book business, not their old iBook laptop line), I noticed that the singular https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibookiBook tag is frequently associated with both the books and laptop.

There are too many questions there (or so it seems to me) to do a quick and obvious reconciliation, so I wanted to ask for consensus: should the iBook tag be applied to the eponymous laptop, should it be a synonym for iBooks, both, neither?

I prefer the former option, since the older-model laptops carried the trade name iBook, while I've rarely ever heard an Apple-provided e-book referred to in the singular as an "iBook".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should the iBook tag actually be for? Books or laptops?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this question asking for opinion, or do you expect answers to be supported by fact?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TestSubject528491 This question is tagged "discussion", so: the former. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm surprised. Questions such as this are usually closed precisely for that reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TestSubject528491 ...On the Meta site, meant for discussion of how apple.stackexchange.com should operate? Are you sure you're not thinking of Ask Different itself?


















https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibooksibooks should apply exclusively to Apple's e-books offering. Maybe it should also be a synonym of the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibookstoreibookstore? Perhaps not.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibookibook should apply exclusively to Apple's classic laptop line.

I can't think of a situation in which one would put the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibookibook tag to signify a question about a specific e-book.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've added a tag wiki to the iBook tag, attempting to make the intended usage clear. I guess we can just clean up the mis-tagged questions as we encounter them?


















I agree in theory with @JasonSalaz's solution https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibooksibooks for the app and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibookibook for the hardware.

Hopwever I think that users will not read the wiki and will carry on misusing the tags.

I think as iBook is now an old machine that a better solution would be to make the tag for the machine to be https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook-laptopibook-laptop and remove an not allow [tag:iBook to be used]. Even then I would not be suprised to see machine related questions being wrongly tagged but this way would lead to the least errors.

The solution to people misusing a tag is to edit it so it is correct, not to make tagspace artificially awkward to accommodate people who can't be bothered to read what their tags mean and use them properly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good idea, @Mark.


















A co worker (who sits in front of me at work) signed into apple.stackexchange.com and posted an answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/18733/1337Can the Kinect be used as a control interface for Mac OS X?

His answer is no longer present.  I'm not sure if his account is still a member either.

My question is: Why was his answer removed?  I'm trying to encourage him to become an active user of this site.

Did I loose any rep for this?  I made an edit to his answer to include a picture but that was removed too.  If I was marked as a spammer in the past then I would suffer an "invsible" rep loss that won't appear in my history.  This happened once on StackOverflow.

I'm just asking for the mods to look into this and let me know (since I'm trying to be a good user)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my co-workers answer deleted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for helping others find the site. There is no invisible rep or even a lag in showing when someone's reputation changes, so perhaps your past experience was due to the scheduled nature of reputation adjustments and bugs in the system.


















The only deleted "answer" on the question is this one:


  I'm interested in seeing this but I don't have enough reputation to +1 this.
  Just found this perusing the web. Looks very much like Kinect for Mac.

This isn't an answer to the question. Things posted as answers that aren't answers get deleted. I don't see anything with a picture. Your friend should be able to answer again, and this time, you can post a link to either their account or to the answer / edits and we can see what might have happened. Is there any chance you are linking to the incorrect question?

I agree that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibooksibooks should refer to the eBooks, but perhaps to avoid confusion, we could use https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook-g4ibook-g4 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook-g3ibook-g3 (or similar) as the tags for the hardware? A bit more distinction beyond plural/singular would probably be a useful thing.

I accepted a suggested edit just now ( https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70269/hoew-to-use-a-unix-console-appHow to use a UNIX console app ), but I get a note saying: 


  You have already reviewed this item. It needs more reviews from other users to be completed.

Speaking as a mod, I have no idea, so I hope someone does.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The edit queue has been quite flakey for me lately (ok since they rolled out the new changes). Often when I choose an action, it doesn't work in that it won't clear. I've noticed that the system somehow corrects itself within a day or two and then it works until the next time it chokes on an edit...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A majority of these recent 'features' really feel like something for the sake of change, versus history of the site. Its still very buggy, and constantly changing.


















Yes - it's very new. Site wide, it now takes two to tango (although I hear they are into threesomes on Stack Overflow).

Good eye, jmlumpkin.

You can't even set a goal anymore for a new badge, or the like, because they change the rules every week. To me, this change almost instills a layer of untrust of a ranked user, versus more community engagement. The whole SE path has changed dramatically in the last two years, and sometimes really ask what for...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like anything - they saw a problem and attempted to fix it. We'll have to see if the downside is worth the fix. I actually like this for goal setting. Now, it's not so much a race for one person to clear the queue. If that's your thing, you can now do that, but twice the number of people get to see each change. You are correct, you can't focus on singlehandedly clearing the queue now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, my goal hasn't been to clear the queue per se. I can see how the new paths make it lessen the ability for one person to make major or constant changes, but on the flip side seems to now almost overmoderate - where a majority of the site feels like maintenance/moderation than Q/A (if you see that side).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My opinion is the editing load is better served by more people doing less - this change means we don't have to be nearly as active as correcting people that start to have sole edit power. I don't think raising the rep to edit would be good - but new editors often need some guidance to get going (myself included). We didn't have a good way to see that in the past - perhaps this will start down that path...


















We only ask that one Stack Exchange site contain your question. As long as you are the author and not simply copying someone else's question I see no reason why anyone would object to you posting here your question if it's on an external site.

I can't speak for Apple, but my experience is each has a slightly different group that answers, so you might want to craft the basic question differently here versus there. There's no need to cross link them unless one site has some breakthrough that you'd like to share on the other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would probably not cross list as the question and answers here should be self sufficient and not rely on external links.

The software hides controls you do not have access to to prevent confusion, but that hiding also can cause confusion when we forget that not everyone can case a close vote. 

Here is what a user with 10,000 or more reputation will see on the site below each question:



Should you reach 3000 the close action will appear. More rep gets you the delete option as well as access to many of the review tools that we as moderators use to keep the site on track. Some good http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/reading on moderation as designed into this site is linked.

I've created an https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipad-miniipad-mini tag and will watch it so see things are going smoothly. If you want to make a new question (or an edit here) linking to some questions that need https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipad-4ipad-4 I'll gladly do the same.

As to the utility of generational tags, we have a chat room to bang out ideas and can always schedule a meeting if people wish. Anyone can also ask here to form community consensus about merging existing tags / make the case for or against having separate tags for each generation.

In general, tagging things with iPad (and only iPad) lets people find and answer questions and the iPad 4 LTE / AT&T sub model specifics almost always are discoverable and searchable via the text of the question or the presence of auxiliary tags like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cellular-datacellular-data or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ltelte in conjunction with the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipadipad.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We do need to flesh this out as a group, but IMO there should be an [tag:iPad] tag and all generations and variations should be a synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I totally agree with @JasonSalaz here - I don't see any need to have a new iMac tag despite the radical changes that product line has gone through since questions can and do list the generation or other identifying criteria. When things are new, the tendancy seems to be to focus on that which can be measured and classified - but over time, the general tags seem to be of the most use to the community.


















The moderators exist to expedite handling of things that most people would close or edit.

In the case of obvious spamming, attention grabs - flagging is often the best way to not encourage bad behavior by bumping something up on the active queue.

When something is so clearly harmful or spam, it's OK to edit if you are improving things - but generally a vote to close or a flag is the best choice.

In the case you linked to - the close vote, downvote and flag would be the actions I would take. No need to edit it to make it look better or less threatening - just close, flag and move on.

We encourage community editing for making things better - so that's always acceptable if your motive is good - but sometimes you can't "polish a turd" and end up spreading it when it needs someone with the right tools to properly dispose of a post.

I'm seeing this on the report to moderator box:



Can the design of the "inform moderator" flag count be updated to a higher contrast design for readability? The black text on a dark red background is not very readable.

Chrome 25 (dev) on Mac OS X 10.8

Would you propose something specific to fix is - is it a contrast issue or a colorblind issue or a sizing issue in your estimation?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For me this is a contrast issue. If the text was white that would help immensely. AFAIK I'm not colorblind :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5black on red is indeed not usually very readable, at all.


















That old post was about an alignment issue, not a color issue. Your screenshot clearly shows that it was indeed fixed.

That doesn't make your issue any less valid though, so this will be fixed as well after the next build (It turns out that red wasn't the intended background color here).

We have been getting some flags about older questions where there was a lot of interest, but over time the questions have not been maintained, updated, etc... Specifically these questions are general survey questions with lots of special rules and boilerplate about searching for duplicate answers, etc... I am not asking specifically about how people feel about community wiki - although many people associate that with these sorts of questions. I'd like to focus on questions similar to the ones below. (Feel free to edit my list or answer with specific site questions you'd like to keep and ones you have voted to close or would if you could)

What are people's feelings about closing these when they are more than a year old unless the community votes to reopen them or a specific post here shows that enough people wish to keep that question open for more people to add answers? I am curious what the consensus is on keeping these open versus closing them and where/when the community would like to see that line.

Again the discussion is if we should in general close questions that are A) old and B) survey (where there are many correct answers or at least not the traditional objective measure where one or two answers cover one question)?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a consensus about closing "survey" questions that are not being kept current?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Burn. With Fire. And TrogDor. And the fires from the deepest darkest Mordor..... Do I need to eloborate more?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Diago if you could elaborate why you think they should be purged (and not just the intensity of your dislike for said questions), that would make for an outstanding answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson The reasons bmike mentioned is enough. Honestly, it is degrading to Q&A to have these hanging around because 99% of the time people lose interest. I can google the top 5, best of etc in less then a minute on Google and get the same result. They get out of hand, and when moderating they actually get painful to see come up again and again for no reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson Also I commented rather then answered for that reason, I haven't been active on SE for some time, and therefore prefer active users to participate in this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Diago fair enough.


















These are still useful reference points.  When I first joined the site, those were some of the first questions that I perused, and I found the information very helpful.

So, I would be reluctant to go on a mission to close or delete all such questions.  Instead, I would suggest that you evaluate each one on a case-by-case basis and determine whether it remains useful or not.

Edit 9/29: Also, I don't think that the moderators should unilaterally close these questions (e.g., in response to flags).  The existing "close vote" process seems adequate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just a point - closed questions simply means that new answers are not accepted. Existing ones can be edited, improved. Deletion is much harder and not something I would say we would do without a similar consensus building exercise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The case by case basis evaluations always fail. Closing and deleting this will always irritate some users, but for the overall good of the community, worth the risk.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike, yes, I understand that.  I'm not seeing what value it adds to close such an existing question (without deleting it).  This merely ensures that the answers cannot be updated, guaranteeing that the problem becomes worse over time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Closed questions can be updated. Locked questions cant. A closed question is normally something that can be salvaged, whereas a locked question is not. Also, votes does not equal quality, list questions are by nature very popular and should be ignored when evaluating quality. Usefulness is also not a major factor, because they can all be argued as being useful by someone. The questions should be if they add value to the internet?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am asking people to list what criteria would be used for that one-by-one process. I'll certainly weigh in with an answer - but I didn't want to prime the pump with my views. At present I'm just commenting from the point of a moderator. What normal users don't see is the 10 to 30 spam answers, new people saying they want to ask a new question in response to one answer in the large survey. The core problem with the large survey is search ability. When someone comes with a problem in terminal (for instance) - they can't find an answer buried in the "top terminal tips and tricks".


















Here's a more detailed analysis / itemized set of personal opinions.  I looked only at the Mac OS X questions, since I'm a Mac OS X user.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/82/24154Which OS X Applications do you find indispensable? - I found this useful when I started using Mac OS X, and I think I'd find it every bit as useful today if I was new to Mac OS X.  (Example: This pointed me to several very useful pieces of software, including helping make me aware about the existence of both Homebrew and MacPorts (previously I had only heard of MacPorts).)  I don't recommend closing it.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/17759/24154What tiny thing in Lion makes you smile or has caught you off guard? - Not of value or interest to me.  It doesn't provide "news I can use".
https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/29212/24154What OS X tweaks, hacks, or modifications couldn't you live without? - Meh.  I found it modestly useful but I wouldn't mind if it disappeared or was closed.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/441/24154Which are the OS X Dashboard Widgets you can't live without? - Meh.  Mildly useful but I wouldn't I wouldn't mind if it disappeared or was closed.  Seems like it hasn't been populated or updated very much.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/20740/24154Which command-line packages do you need? - Probably should be closed.  I love the command line, so the concept is great, but the answers are not so great.  Most of the answers are lists of command-line programs (without explanation of why those are important or what they do).  That probably isn't super-helpful: if you know what the command-line program does, you already know whether you want/need it or not.  This could have been useful if it gave an overview to command-line programs that readers probably weren't already aware, and an explanation of what those programs do and why you need them ... but that's not this question. 
https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/5435/24154Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X? - I would not recommend closing a question that so many people have apparently found useful (going by the number of upvotes and favorites).  And some of the answers are useful and good stuff.  I found this to be a helpful resource, so I don't think the question should be closed.  (I see that it has been "locked".  I tend to think it should be unlocked.  I don't see any reason why it should remain locked or how it adds value to prevent others from updating their answer or adding new answers.  I'm not used to seeing "locked" questions and am not clear on how "locked" differs from "closed".)


These are just my personal opinions.  Others may vary, but I thought it might be helpful to start with some concrete, specific reasons for my personal opinions, broken down by question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now this is what I'm talking about - can we generalize some "rules" by which closing bad questions could be a group consensus rather than the moderators doing it. We're not against closing things - but when the community takes care of this for us - we can then spend time on the spam and other "mod-only" tasks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the way you answered this, even if I don't agree with many parts of your answer. Well, I agree that they're your personal opinions. I just don't share them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5preferring Homebrew over Macports really makes the question show as not constructiveb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark, I must confess I don't follow your reasoning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with the use of Homebrew rather than macports and can give reasons which would not be agreed by the answerer of your question thus machine the requirement for a question to be non constructiveb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark, I think you're getting overly caught up in the question of Homebrew vs MacPorts.  I apologize if my answer tempted you into that tangent; I've edited my answer to downplay the question of which to choose.  Rather, I'm saying that the answers there helped me realize the existence of Homebrew, which then enabled me to do some further research to make an informed decision about Homebrew vs MacPorts -- something I might not have stumbled across, if not for that question.  (cont.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont.)  @Mark, More importantly, I think your criteria for judging that question are poorly thought out.  Just because you disagree with one sentence in one comment on one answer on that page does *not* mean that the whole question is somehow "non constructive".  That's just silly.


















I made a question, is this
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73421/how-itunes-11-manage-duplicatesDoes iTunes 11 need extra services or tools to manage duplicates in the library?
The core of the question is "Maybe iTunes 11 finds and delete them automagically?"
It is got edited TWICE to remove my rant AND it has been closed as a duplicate question because it has been changed to "how i can find duplicated songs".
It's not a duplicate question, and I wish to have it reopened.
I have the feeling that the editor had a reaction like "OMG this guy is so wrong, iTunes 11 is a masterpiece, Apple can't be wrong"
What might I do to help with this post?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What can I do if I feel someone is editing a specific question to change the meaning in bad faith?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Votes on meta are odd. I upvote things I don't agree with since I appreciate the discussion and want everyone to see it. Others downvote things they don't agree with (and I think most long time SO/SE users vote that way) - c'est la vie in an open system ...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm a big fan of constructive discourse, whether someone agrees with me or not. I'm not a big fan of rants and name-calling. I think Apple makes some great products, and some of Apple's products frustrate me incredibly. But when the first word of the title of a meta post calls editors on this site a derogatory name and assumes they have malicious intent, I'll happily vote against the post (if not close or delete it) because name-calling is rarely conducive to figuring out truth. That said, the answers and comments on this post seem quite constructive.


















I'm glad you came here and posted. I was pondering whether to delete your entire thread - reverse the editing and let your mild insults stand so people could just know you've got an opinion and decide to move on or commiserate and stand by you. I am certain that many feel exactly like you - perhaps even several Apple fans.
I haven't had chance to have a second moderator look at your posts - but I'll be sure to have another have a look to make sure we're comfortable as a group closing it.
I don't want anyone getting bullied here - but when you walk in and call people fanboys - it's hard to respect the words you are writing since the first thought that comes when I see someone resorting to names over logic is "I'd sure rather this person explained how they are not a hater or troll before resorting to dismissing others as fans."
I'll start a private chat to see what you want your question to be and if I can help you get it on the site. Have a look at this question and comments in the mean time:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/73191/5472How can I downgrade iTunes 11 to 10.7 in Mountain Lion?

We have a lot of people showing up and using terms like "hate, stupid, fanboy" and we are trying to keep things on a level where in a month - people don't have to go back and retract things they said because they didn't like that something changed on them. I’ve edited your post here to remove the term that has an argumentative tone to see if people are willing to change their votes. The edit history will help anyone that wonders where the fanboy wording originated.
While I'm thinking things over - would you go back and edit the question that is currently closed (still searchable, still editable, still re-openable by any 5 users that like it and have reputation on the site to reopen votes) and word it to be exactly what you wish? You can totally revert my edits - build on them or re-write it from scratch.
I'd like to act on something you feel captures your intent perfectly and not in reaction to flags or comments or how it was worded initially.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I reread your question as originally posted. I can see three answers you are seeking: 1) use some third party windows tool to make up for iTunes no longer offering the function 2) someone to say from experience that iTunes match will fix your sizable duplicate problem or will not fix it (so you can decide to pay or not pay) 3) someone to show you step by step how to go back to iTunes 10 on windows.  Did I miss the intent of your question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No no I don't want to rollback to iTunes 10, I want to have the 11, I like the UI. What I meant is that now my duplicate mp3 are "missing" when I search them, so I wonder if iTunes got rid of them automatically.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK - I'll reopen it and work to get you and any potential editors to come to a mutual agreement on how to word the question. Please hit us up here or in the chat room if you would like moderator assistance in getting all of the editors on board. In a nutshell - as long as there isn't an edit war where things go back/forth/back - we expect people to work out edits in the chat rooms. Flag things and moderators will help out as needed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ok, I didnt' consider the chat room for that


















I felt there was a valid question in there (how can I removes dupes on iTunes 11 for Windows), but if your main reaction after we take the time to edit it to a proper form is to insist on ranting instead of posing answerable questions and calling names, your questions have no place in our community.

As I commented on the question, have a look at the FAQ to learn how to ask questions here. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, the radical changes that every time Apple is imposing "with surprise" made me "see red", and write the question in the wrong way. You are right to enforce a policy, otherwise every question will become a fight. I was wrong, edited the question and removed comments.


















To add my two cents: If the whole purpose of your question is to ask whether iTunes 11 finds and somehow flags duplicates automatically, just rewrite it accordingly and request a reopen. It is most likely a rhetorical question but I still might support you in reopening then.

But please also understand that the original wording of the question appeared to more of a rant about a removed feature (and Apple in general) than a serious question. Statements like "forever, because Apple doesn't listen to users" and some of the comments just don't instill too much confidence to the contrary.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I wanted to ask if it does find them automatically. After all, this can be a good reason to remove the feature (do it without asking and keep the best file - that's what I was doing manually... if it does it automatically that would be great!). Then, I was angry for that and I wrote the question in a totally wrong way. Sorry.

The best way is to simply copy all the text and see if it needs editing - if you want to give credit to the original poster, that is nice - so paraphrase things unless you want it to be verbatum and you quote the author. For good form you should link to the old question and explain why you feel iOS 6 is different than iOS 5.

Unless you have a reason to believe the notifications are different, we should generalize the old question by an edit to say explicitly it's for iOS 5 and iOS 6.

Smart!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How was this made exactly?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dynamic It's a simple Sinatra app running on Heroku that uses the Stack Exchange API to query the number of active bounties and how much they're worth, then with Imagemagick generates a PNG with those numbers on it and serves it up. Add some caching and that's pretty much it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KyleCronin Pretty cool idea. Is Ask Different the only SE site that has this sort of ad? I'd love to implement this on other sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dynamic Feel free to use this ad on other SE sites - the app looks at the referer to determine which site to query for bounties for. As far as implementing a similar ad yourself, the code isn't public at this time, but it's not that hard to code.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I tried stealing this, only to be automatically told it wasn't an image of imgur, so it wasn't acceptable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Oddthinking Post with a dummy i.stack.imgur.com image, then edit the post and swap out the image URL with http://stack-exchange-dynamic-ads.herokuapp.com/bounty.png. I just tried it here on Ask Different Meta and that loophole still works.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kyle: I've used that trick, thanks. Does this ad actually appear in rotation on the Apple site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Oddthinking Yes, or at least it did until the new Community Promotion Ads thread was started.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For future readers, [here](https://github.com/kylecronin/Stack-Exchange-Bounty-Ad) is the Github repo.


















Making it as a synonym will not end the problem as users will just add it without reading what it is for. 

I think the only way is to clean the questions up and then burninate the tag

If we do not want to keep checking this tag is empty we will have to get the tag blacklisted.

I think volume is a difficult case as it will be the "obvious" tag to use when the question is written and they won't think of the other possible use.

It depends if we want to keep looking to check or we want to stop any abuse up front.If we are happing to keep checking I would make volume a synonym of audio as I suspect people looking for the filesystem use of volume will take a bit more notice of issues.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting thoughts on the false adding of a tag. I'm sure no matter which we decide, there will always be some problems. If we kill the tag, my feeling is will come back sooner or later. We could always postpone that aspect and deal with it when it arises. My hunch is most people are much faster about cleaning up a wrong tag when it's clearly wrong (without needing moderator oversight/action).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Having done some work on SO burninations - many users do not read the tag summaries e.g.if the tag says DO NOT USE they will - also common word like volume will be added back.


















Since we cannot hinder people from trying to use a volume tag for either one of its meanings, I would propose that we block the tag and  thus force the poster to use one the following tags instead:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sound-volumesound-volume
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/disk-volumedisk-volume


The choice of words is intended and will make sure that a poster will be suggested either one of these tags when trying to add the tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/volumevolume. 

Tag blocking already exists with some plural forms of other tags:


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We actually don't block tags in general. At you speaking of a tag synonym perhaps for a specific plural/singular case?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Actually, I really did think that plural forms were automatically blocked. Wasn't there a talk about how we needed an exception to allow the iPhone-4s tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Check my tag edit on his question. It's all done manually AFAIK. See if you can clean up the two plural tags and tag this with discussions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I can remove the existing plural tags, but I can't create the [tag:discussions] tag. ("not allowed")b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks - when there isn't a guide - empirical evidence is often nice to poke at how things work. Either I have enough reputation to make any tag or diamond moderators can make tags that the system has a soft rule on creation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since this asks to blacklist/block the tag - I'm proposing we implement half of your idea. See my answer...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK - I'll start on this in the next few days as time allows (and to avoid flooding the edits to the home page)


















I reviewed the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34870/is-it-possible-to-remove-the-dock-in-lion/67237#67237suggested edit of Lauri Ranta's answer today, but somehow got distracted, and honestly didn't even pay attention to the edit enough to give it justice. I have never had this happen before but absentmindedly clicked approve. As soon as I clicked "Approve" I realized my error. 

Is there a way to reverse this type of "vote"?

I understand it's not a huge deal: first, because there are more people that vote to approve/reject it, and two, rollbacks are possible, but if there is a way, I would be interested in knowing how.

Another approval made the edit live. http://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/history


















Yes - the edit history allows for this quite nicely.

By the way, I'm curious if you happen to know how many "votes" it takes for a non-mod to approve a suggested edit? I'm guessing two or three, but not sure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It takes two @bassplayer7 - http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1489/suggested-edits-now-take-more-than-one-review and http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/151536/it-takes-two-to-tangob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting. Thank you. I was just about to ask if it took two of the same votes to make it live, but then saw your comment on my question. Makes sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The first action to gain 2 votes turns an edit suggestion into an approval or rejection.


















Since we don't have an answer clearly deciding which side to pick, I propose a two step process:


Use https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/13414/gentmattgentmatt's nice https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1527/5472tag name suggestions to clean up the existing questions so that anything tagged with https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/volumevolume gets edited to have the new tags https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sound-volumesound-volume and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/disk-volumedisk-volume so that we have a clean count of which is more popular. We would then have no questions with https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/volumevolume and can watch things for 30 days (or longer) to see if / when it gets added - based on the fraction of questions in both bins after 30 days - we can decide to make a synonym and point volume at one of the two.
After a few months - we can decide to collapse things down https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/disk-volumedisk-volume to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filesystemfilesystem and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sound-volumesound-volume to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/audioaudio or to not collapse them. Why hold up step #1 if we don't have counts or data to decide on step 2.


Merging all the things too early is hard (possibly impractical and/or impossible) to undo, but I don't see a better suggestion than lengthening the tags.

If anyone has heartburn on these names - now is the time to air it. Once this gets something like 5 more up votes than any other answer or the moderators decide to pull the trigger - we'll get going on retagging things.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not quite sure if I understand your intentions correctly. I would not want to reintroduce the volume tag as you suggest under point "1" - since I expect that unexperienced users will falsely use this tag in the future. I really want to block the tag and thus force the poster to use the tag sound-volume or disk-volume instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In point "2", do you mean that you want to remove the 'disk-volume' tag and only use 'filesystem' tag instead? (and only 'audio' instead of 'sound-volume')b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Point 2 is we postpone any/all decisions on whether we opt to take further action or opt to leave things as they are. I know you want to block the tag - but I want a proposal that has no blocking in it. We already moderate improper tag usage, blocking is a pain (and not something we can actually do directly) so I wanted people to have an option that can be carried out now with the tools we have today at our disposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My personal opinion is the tags you propose are too small to be useful and would be better served merged into the main topics of audio and filesystem. But without making a change and seeing what we have and what new questions come in once the tags are created, perhaps the data will be otherwise and change my very loosely held opionion on it today. Maybe disk-volume makes sense to have as a standalone tag but not audio (or perhaps the other way around). My opinion is we should clean up now and see what happens before we revisit point 2.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, I got that now :). A sound-volume tag is indeed very specific and probably too small to be useful. Then, it is also redundant since we already have the audio tag. Depending on a users vocabulary he/she will think of different tags. I don't expect that a non-techie would think of the word filesystem wherever the term disk-volume is also applicable. Therefore I think it's best to introduce the tags 'disk-volume' and 'sound-volume' and link them to 'audio' and 'filesystem'.


















I closed https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46458/when-is-a-macbook-pro-considered-at-end-of-life-and-in-need-of-replacementthis question as "not constructive" but it was re-opened by five votes, and I'm a little baffled as to why people think it's answerable.

My problem with this question is the passive voice "considered" — who is doing the considering? The question asks "should" I use a computer until it dies? Who's to tell me. You can ask about pros and cons, but "should I go out and buy a new computer" isn't a question the site can answer.

I agree there are valid questions for the site related to this post, but I don't see how this question is answerable.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Community consensus about potentially unanswerable questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When every answer can begin with "it depends," you're on pretty unstable ground imho.


















Innocent until proven guilty.  If someone says, "I stole this mac from my brother and want to change the wallpaper as a joke," you politely tell them where to go and how to get there.  "If someone says, "I bought this used, and can't log in," and you know the answer, help them.  An example: Second hand stores.  I've seen used laptops at second hand stores.  The store doesn't always know anything about it.  I've seen used computers at consignment stores too, and no, the store won't let you contact the seller.

I do information security for a living.  I sometimes ask the nefarious questions.  It's my job.  I want to know if there is a way to do "X."  And telling me, "If it's your job, you already know..." is B.S.  New exploits happen all the time.

In short, it's not your job to be judge, jury, and executioner.  Unless someone states they are doing something wrong, who are you to assume otherwise?

I'd say the question is overly broad and should be closed as NARQ.

We have to guess what the OP really wants.

Is it a policy or justification in crafting a workplace decision?
Is it seeking affirmation?

There may be several good questions embedded in this question, but it begs the question "what next?" What answer is the OP seeking and what will they do next with that answer? Are they going to buy a newer mac, buy an older mac? Since computers are general purpose tools, without some specificity in the question anyone could draw a line in the sand anywhere and the question becomes subjective.

Someone could argue that their 15 year old Mac still runs and there is no obsolescence. Another could argue you should replace things yearly. It all depends on how much value you put into your time - no one buys a faster tool when their existing one works and doesn't slow them down. Everyone buys a new tool when they loose more money waiting for a current tool and could buy a new one that lets them be more efficient for billable work.

I don't like the official https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/16065/how-does-the-bounty-system-workFAQ on bounties since it focuses on the answers and minutia.

You pay a bounty to get your question featured. That's what you get for the points.

If someone answers after the bounty - awesome. If you choose to award it to an existing question or choose to award it so that the system doesn't award half the bounty to whatever question gets 2 votes after the bounty started (or the most votes) - then you have that option.

If an answer helps you solve it - mark the tick for accepted. That way you can award the bounty or not as you feel best. Keep in mind - if you want to award more than one bounty, the next time you issue a bounty - the points will double, so you might award the initial 50 to one and leave the 100 to the one you feel deserves more rep bonus.

If you look at paying the bounty to feature the question - it seems to help most people decide how to dispose of the points once you reach the end of the period (since if you got an AWESOME answer that nailed your question you probably would award the bounty immediately since you were so happy to have your answer).

In the end - I usually award my bounty to the least bad answer and then decide I didn't do a good enough job writing the question to get the answer I wanted. I'll usually make a reminder in a week or two to revisit it, edit it and see if I want to try a bounty or let it ride.

In your case - HAVP is something that needs a pretty specific skill set to solve compilation errors (especially if you have any other OSS libraries installed or even not the same OSS libraries the developer of the package has on their system when they built that package) so it's a good thing you even got two answers in the short time frame that question has been around.

I intend to exercise the ability of moderators to issue hats to the community user. The festivities will commence once the proper code is issued to the web engines.

I rewrote the question so that the OP gets the information they were seeking, and it meets the requirements of the site.

After the rewrite it was still closed as not a real question.

There is no close reason "diverges too much from rev 1" so closing it as not a real question, then asking me to repost it verbatim makes absolutely no sense.

If a moderator believes a revision does injustice to the original, then they should revert it. 

I believe the op would get the information they need from the answers to the revision, and I believe it's a real question. So obviously I am baffled by the moderators insistence that it remained closed.

The fact that it was opened after a moderator single close vote suggests that the community disagrees with the moderator. And that was before revision.

The fact that a moderator had to use a final moderator vote to close it again rather than letting the community decide suggests that the moderator wants to tell people that its firmly on the wrong side of the line, as a form of site guidance. This is after the revision.

If anything, the actions taken for this question are confusing.

If the intent is to tell people that they should not revise questions to fit site guidelines, then a revert should be performed.

If the intent is to tell people that the question originally and revised is not acceptable, then a suggestion to repost the question is wrong.

If the revision doesn't do harm to the original question, and the revision and answers are acceptable and valuable to the site, then the question should remain open.

I did click revert just before posting my comment to you because it was too dramatic a change from the original question, so I'm confused why it didn't roll back. Working with the OP to revise a question to make it fit site guidelines is a wonderful and helpful thing to do. Taking a vague question and turning it into a specific one without consulting the OP is, IMO, not a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That said, the OP seems to be gone and you've turned the question into something answerable, so if you're okay with not getting the credit I believe you deserve for it, we can just reopen it as it stands.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still think you posting your own question would be better so you get credit for your fine work, but since my rollback didn't take and your edits are there, let's run with this.


















I'd just as soon leave the original image size as is. Let the end client determine what the image will be scaled to if at all.

Update: Currently the best that can be done is to have a client-side script check the available space in the content area and request an appropriately sized image.

In the future new properties in the http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/#the-object-fitCSS3 image module could deal with the issue (look at object-fit for one).

2018 Update - less than 50 questions were migrated away this year, so this seems to be low hanging fruit to make any changes. Roughly half the migrations away were to Stack Overflow, so that’s the #1 destination for migrations as has been the pattern for the past couple years.

The moderators here can and do migrate things to any site that accepts inbound questions - just pop an "other" flag with comments that you want it to be migrated to another site (especially if you have reputation on that site or have cleared the migration in the destination chat room before flagging). In reality, our site doesn't have enough people to migrate a question without moderator intervention and with the new timeframe to migrate things - most questions will just get closed as off topic and not actually migrated going forward.

Just to put some data behind the rationale - in the last 90 days our site migrated three questions. One to this meta, one to SuperUser and one to GIS.

For the calendar year 2012, we have 19 question migrations outbound:


6 - SuperUser
5 - Our Meta
2 - Stack Overflow
1 - Unix, User Experience, Server Fault, DBA, GIS


Of the 19 migrations, not a single one was done by users without moderator assistance. Even a slam dunk migration like the 5 questions about the site that users can surely self-migrate to our meta are not being seen and migrated in practice by the users of the site. If we find a large change in these migration numbers - it might be worth bugging for a code change to alter the user-migration sites, but I would expect the developers to remove any user migrations based on our usage statistics and not add them.

As for the number of people I can understand hat but the review queues are at a low level so might be OK but I accept there might not be enough people here who would know a good SO questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You nailed it - when we ping the mods on a site before migrating a question, we find most requests to migrate by users to be rejected by the incoming site mods. We do always try to comment and point the asker to the correct site, but also to explain why we reject that question and suggest ways to improve the phrasing of the question before they go and re-ask it on SO.


















We have a question that I've closed to see if it can be salvaged:

It started out as can I upgrade an iPhone 3G to iOS 6 - where the answer is basically - NO.

Then it got edited to iPhone 3GS where the answer is YES - but now many of the comments and answers make no sense.

If I revert the edits, we need to delete the answers targeting 3GS and vice versa. Can someone propose a good solution to this other than closure?

That implies not diluting or changing the sentiment of the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you had said "I would expect" instead of implying that everyone here "you would expect" I wouldn't have chosen to change the sentiment and tone of your question. Seriously - just edit it back if you feel you want a more cranky tone and are deprived of that voice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"You would think/expect" is just an idiom; not to be taken literally. I am reverting the edit.


















It is on my todo list for this year. When I do it'd be rolling out for all sites at once.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6331/shortcuts-gestures-you-cant-live-withoutShortcuts & gestures you can't live without is getting a lot of attention because it was selected as a "straw question" for the "Quick Start" guide for new users while it was being developed.  It was quickly pointed out that perhaps we don't want to encourage this type of question because - even though it's CW - it's more of a subjective list question instead of a practical answerable question.

Should we close / lock this question in particular?  And it is time to evaluate all of the other very popular questions in the same vein?  I love quite a few of these types of questions, and I'd hate to see them be deleted, but they're not very Stack-Exchangey.  

Here are a few examples from my Favorites:

However, I believe this is good to discuss going forward so that the [faq] could be adjusted if needed as well as to get down some thoughts on why these questions are less than optimal in many cases.


















Ask Different does allow (unlike Stack Overflow where these should be closed as non-constructive) questions asking for lists and software recommendations. If we keep allowing these then some of those lists are acceptable.

I think we definitely should use another question as an example as the are not the best questions and do not give an example to new users of what are normal good questions that give rise to answers that can be considered correct. 

I think the list questions should be rare and have to be controlled. For example they should probably be community wiki. The normal way of doing these is now ask for one example in each answer.

I think the ones that have a limited list like the "Shortcuts and gestures" and the "What are your favorite Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts?' are valid list as we could enumerate all the answers. The others are all subjective and I cannot really see how we would choose if a feature would be in the list or not.

I think there is good hope we can improve some of the close reasons and tweak the FAQ in the coming months. 

For now, it's very important that people down vote questions that are un-helpful, un-useful and/or overly-subjective.

As moderators, we're here to assist with community norms, but out of nearly 25 thousand questions a ridiculously small amount are even being down voted.

Here are some queries you can use to see which questions are currently candidates for either a high ratio of down votes or high total of down votes:


http://data.stackexchange.com/apple/query/93455/popular-questions-with-the-most-down-voteshttp://data.stackexchange.com/apple/query/93455/popular-questions-with-the-most-down-votes

As it stands today, there are only a dozen questions with 2 total down votes and another dozen with more than 2 down votes, so we have less than one tenth of one percent of questions that I would start with in evaluating whether to close questions for lack of usefulness.

See http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#reputation and http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/vote-for-this-question-or-the-kitten-gets-it/ for the facts about voting and the problem of questions not getting voted on enough. The site would work better if more people cast votes on questions more freely. Can I count on you to help spread the word on question voting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5won't make much difference to me  I would still flag or vote to close I have enough rep I don't care about downvoting so I would downvote but can't think of a case I would the rep issue was for a possible for those with less rep - but thanks for the clarification either the question should be closed or it is OK


















Honestly, who cares. SE is meant to be an informative source of first hand accounts of peoples tip, tricks, and solutions to various problems. Even if one did argue that these aren't in the same Q/A style, what does it matter? They're informative and help people, which meets the end goal of our operations.

However, an informative source does not mean a source that provides information. We need to curate and decide what needs to be weeded out and what we need to keep. The questions also need to be put in an orderly fashion. Honestly, we really *do* care what does/doesn't go on here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The threads in question are very well curated (imo). They're well styled, grammar checked and even some useful screen shots. The information is concise, clear and productive. By no means would I compare them to "weeds."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Only because people have taken the time to go through them and edit them into good answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So what? The result is nice.


















The sole reason i joined AskDifferent is to give a answer to question. But I was unable to do that as my answer contained two small pics and i didn't have "Enough Reputation Points". So now my question is, "How to raise my Reputation points?"

I have noticed today that my (and other users) acceptance rate is non-existent anymore. Usually gave me motivation to go ahead and solve my own questions to keep it above 90%.

Is it permanently removed ? What's the deal ?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Acceptance rate gone?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IIRC acceptance rate is only shown if it's "poor". Like, 60% or lower? Somewhere near that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems to be gone even for users with poor acceptance rates.


















As off 2 days ago the accept rate has been removed across the network as per the following feature request: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/136951/lets-stop-displaying-a-users-accept-rateLet's stop displaying a user's accept rate. 

On the bigger sites it was generating more noise then what was required, and it was mostly demotivating to most users. Since the focus should be on good answers, and not reputation gain.

Recently returned to active participation in Ask Different so bear with me if rules have changed.

Saw this post https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/80135/help-i-need-help-hereRestoring a jailbroken iPhone which IMO needed editing.
Though the edit link is displayed, it's unclickable. Only share is allowed.

Why?

Possible to merge both questions for future reference?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Phorce It says "Suggested edits are not allowed on non-tag-wiki posts on meta sites" when you hover it on meta, so I guess that makes sense.


















The question had a pending edit by a user with low reputation (<2000). This has to be approved by two users with reputation >=2000.

As both @Globalnomad and @Phorce have < 2000 you cannot edit or approve it so you have to wait until the pending edit is approved. (I have approved it so only one more needed now)

You bring up a very good point. I looked into the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagesmessages (and noticed it needs to be updated!), and took note of how it was implemented. It covers both iOS and OSX, which is probably the way it should be. Since both Messages and Reminders are available on both iOS (5+) and Mountain Lion, I think it is important to update Reminders to reflect that it could mean either iOS or OSX.

When a user asks a question with either the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remindersreminders or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagesmessages, there should probably also be an https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iosios, or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osxosx in there as well, unless, that is, the question applies to both OS.

I have stopped by the review page on StackOverflow a few times, and noticed that they give test questions and answers for the reviewer to catch - typically flag - correctly. 

This particular one was in the Late Answer review queue:


Obviously, it is a post worthy of a moderator flag. I saw that and clicked to flag it, but then was told that I passed the test. 

I think this is a really nice feature: would it be possible to have on AskDifferent as well, or have I just never been tested for some reason?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why doesn't AskDifferent Reviews have tests?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The main stack overflow has slightly different rules for review as well as orders of magnitude more traffic, flags, posts, etc... so some things we see on a blue moon happens daily or even hourly on Stack Overflow. Since this is something more geared to the site owners, we might need to wait for them to answer even if it's a vague - we're not going to document exactly how tests work to prevent gaming them.


















As @bmike says each site does this differently. In Stack Overflow the tests were added because there were many users trying to get review badges by just clicking Looks Good even when the question was obviously bad or vice versa, These questions attempt to catch those doing this. See several Meta Stack Overflow questions

In Ask Different we do not have enough reviews for people to get the higher review badges (ie requiring more that one review so there is no incentive to game the system by just pressing the button without actually reviewing.

Also I haven't seen any complaints in Ask Different about incorrect reviews.

Thanks for the info.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are working to point out things that we catch when looking at the review history - especially if there is a pattern of people choosing to close a question as "too localized" for instance when that reason doesn't really apply. I agree we don't have large problems, but our reviews could be better in some cases.


















The concept of playback has a tag at the moment and rather than just re-tag the questions to be about the apps doing the playing, I wanted to see if anyone had a suggestion to not kill this tag.

Users get removed for a variety of reasons:


They decide to https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/156559/improve-the-user-self-deletion-processdelete themselves (or someone with their credentials deletes the account)
They age out after https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/146450/delete-old-unloved-usersdiffering periods of abandonment based on what content that user has left on the site
For reasons of moderation
Upon requests to https://apple.stackexchange.com/helpStack Exchange


If you want to post the specifics or flag this and provide us the moderators with more information to see if we can even determine which account was deleted, we can look into the specifics.

As you see, the links I have provided are for the main meta, since deletion is about common code and rules for all Stack Exchange sites but in some cases a site moderator has slightly more visibility into specifics on their site.

Since you mentioned reputation, I checked yours at this page:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/37954/user1301428?tab=reputationhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/users/37954/user1301428?tab=reputation

And there is an entry:



That is what you will see when a user that had given you reputation is removed from the site - taking that reputation back. I too lost reputation on that day (-50 points), but since voting is anonymous and deletion isn't something even moderators can audit or look back to see what happened, it's likely that one user that was here for a while left (causing several people to lose reputation) although it could also be several automatic deletions being handled as a batch and reputation adjusted once to balance the numbers.

Maybe the message should be improved a bit...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can ask for feature requests here or on the main meta. I would suggest the latter since it gets many more people visiting it.


















So, the question already on this Stack Exchange site says that it's OK to ask jailbreaking-related questions - as long as it doesn't violate piracy laws or suggest a criminal offence. 

TL;DR: Jail-breaking or 'hacking' a product is not considered illegal, since you are the rightful owner of the device and may do with it whatever you see fit - however it does void your warranty and is not suggested by Apple Inc.

Anyway, if you https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/492/41166refer to this question about jaibreaking, it's quite obvious that it's about the Apple product you are hacking.

But - is asking a question about a tool used for jailbreaking (such as the recent and first iOS6+ jailbreak tool http://evasi0n.comevasi0n) allowed? Furthermore, if you are using Linux or Windows as the tool's host - is it still on-topic or a place for L&U or StackOverflow (etc.)?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is asking about jailbreaking with another OS on- or -off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have a specific question in mind or is this just asking for confirmation that with a [tag:jailbreak] of 299 questions and several policy links that jailbreaking itself is fine we really are OK with jailbreak as a topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It was for confirmation - and yes, I did have a specific question. I am an Ubuntu user, so I thought that asking about how to jailbreak ***on Ubuntu*** could be off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think if a question is related **directly** to an Apple product of any kind, it will be on-topic. Even if someone asks why doesn't his iPhone headset's control doesn't work on a PC.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike then it should be in the main site's faq too, no?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NOTjust--user4304 I would expect us to be inclusive. A tool that ran on windows to jailbreak an iOS device would be on topic here. I'd want to head to the main site's meta (or super user or ubuntu, linux, other site's meta) to know what they want to have on their site.


















Questions about jailbreak tools (i.e. software you run on your computer to make your iPhone/whatever do what you want it to do) seems like it would be on-topic here. The FAQ specifically says that "third-party hardware and software for Apple products" is on-topic. 

This is a bit of an edge case if the software is to do something to your Apple product (i.e. jailbreak it), but the software itself does not run on an Apple product. In that case, I'd still think you'd be on-topic, but be aware that for the most part, this isn't a group of people whose specialty is Linux or Windows software, so while your question might be on-topic here, you might find a better answer on one of the other sites you named.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I couldn't agree more! although sites like serverfault.com  has the disadvantage that they do not have the jailbreaking specialty. So I guess it is really personal preference where to ask the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FLY Server Fault in particular also has a [pretty narrowly confined scope](http://serverfault.com/faq#questions) in that questions are supposed to be asked in an IT-professional capacity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EliahKagan I agree, would be beter to use askubuntu.com instead of serverfault.com


















Ideally, we like to preserve information that has value. We let people keep reputation from votes when the content is there for several months since we like to reward half baked ideas that move the discussion forward. When a comment or an edit can preface what part is now known to be wrong - what the actual answer is (with links or just narrative), that is the best.

If there is no way to save it, you might link to it in the chat room or flag for moderator review. As long as you have the option to delete the answer, it's low enough in votes and other modifications that it remains in your power to decide to delete.

Now, nothing actually gets deleted, since high rep users, moderators and site staff see all posts - even deleted ones - there is always the chance someone will vote to reverse a deletion, make an edit, whatever.

The primary way the system suppresses bad questions and answers is by reflecting several negative votes. Once the community has expressed a net -4 vote on a post, it begins to fade away and become eligible for automatic culling without needing a moderator (elected or just a user having earned moderator tool access) to actually case a close or delete vote.

By down voting content that is not useful to you, you are starting the deletion process and helping moderate your site.

I don't care about reputation points but I do not want to leave a mess that confuses future readers. Been flagging poor quality answers at Ask Different and others, and they're a lot of them. I don't want to contribute to noise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Be sure to down vote all poor questions (no rep penalty) and especially poor answers (one rep penalty).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Been doing that, will continue to do so. Really wish poor questions (with no good answers) can be deleted so as not to pollute search results.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Globalnomad Poor questions with no good answers *can* be deleted. It's far more likely to happen if said question has a negative score. So if a question is unanswerable, badly researched, unlikely to be useful to anyone but the asker, etc., be sure to vote accordingly. Low-scoring material is less likely to show up in search results and more likely to get deleted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, I understand. Thanks.


















I'd like to quote from a comment I put on my nomination:

"[...]so I hope that the Town Hall chats offer a fair chance for every participant to actually participate, taking into account geographical and timezone discrepancies. AskDifferent is not just an American website for Americans. As of the time of this comment, 3 of the 6 nominations are from Europe, and 2 of the remaining 3 are not entirely serious."

Since then one more US candidate has entered.

I'll look forward to the mail, and hope that a happy medium can be made to satisfy all candidates.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was going to post the same thing, but you beat me to it. I'd like to add that last year, the Town Hall was at a time when it was very hard for non-US candidates to participate live, and we ended up with an election that gave us a team of five moderators in the same country, leaving significant time gaps in moderation coverage for this world-wide site. Given that the moderator coverage the site needs most is from non-US time zones, I'd strongly like to encourage the powers that be to schedule the Town Hall at an appropriate time for this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll do my best to try and fit a more popular time period. Having had to stay up in the wee hours, or wake up extra early, to accomodate other site town hall chats, it's not unfamiliar territory for me to run in any time zone. The mail was sent out a while ago, by the by.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, now I remember I use my GMAIL account for login, but nothing else...not been in there for months...!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Done. Was kind of difficult to find time between work (where I can't join a chat for one hour), family commitments and sleep. Good luck with finding a slot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I don't envy you that task!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd be jazzed to get a time when candidates from Europe can attend and participate. It'll be an interesting challenge since part of the discussion is to allow maximum site participation (even if all the mods and candidates can attend a 3AM meeting), it's also nice to have the chat when interested parties can ask / dialog. As bad as it is to lack candidates during the live chat, lacking the crowd to grill them doesn't have as good a mechanism for delayed participation as a delayed answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I hope that the time slot I picked is acceptable. It's basically an evening timeslot for most European timezones, though the particular hour had to be such to fit as many people as possible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well done (at least for me), thanks a lot!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @GraceNote for making this happen! This is very good for the site that you found a time slot that works for so many people!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can make this one, and I'm already sharpening my metaphors.

Just posted this question -https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81930/compiling-ns-cocoa-emacs-on-osx-with-svg-support#comment94462_81930Compiling (NS/Cocoa) Emacs on OSX with SVG support - and was immediately told this was perhaps off topic, and to take it to SO.

There are a lot of questions on AskDifferent relating to homebrew and compiling software, please let me know if this question is off topic or not.

side note: This was voted to close on SO for being off topic, and I'd tend to agree with that, here however I feel it's on topic.

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/515/are-ports-related-questions-off-topic-for-ask-different/516#516Does this answer apply?

Additional note:

If this were a general Unix compilation question, I'd be in full agreement that it was better suited to the Unix stackexchange, or maybe SuperUser, however, this is 100% mac/osx specific, and has no relevance to other platforms.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about compiling open source applications on OS X off topic here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Isn't stackoverflow.com enough already for questions about code, programs, binaries and netconfigs?


















My inclination is to say it's on-topic here. It's not a developer question; it's an end-user question. Yes, it involves compiling, but for the purpose of running software on your machine. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the ambiguity is that the answer, could involve patching the software to fit, rather than, "drag this here" or "enter this `predfined command` into the terminal" - However, it's likely that the answer would involve, "apply this patch, like so"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree it's a bit of an edge case in the sense that it's outside the normal process of installing Mac OS X Software. It's definitely outside the expertise of many users of this site, including me. But ultimately, it's about getting software that someone else wrote running on your Mac. That's a big piece of what this site is about.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5TBH, it's something I've wanted to do for quite some time, and even though I don't expect an answer today/tomorrow/next week, I still need a place where it's specifically relevant, and apple.se is the best I can think of. Ultimately, I'll still be looking into solving this myself, and I can post a solution. - the fact that it's a tough question shouldn't warrant it to be closed / deemed off topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These questions often get marked off topic in Stack Overflow. I suspect it is in a gray area and sometimes they get answered and sometimes they get marked as off topic depending on who reviews it which is not good. So if this ius on topic here we need to note that and I for one will start flagging new questions in SO for migration here. Also this implies we deal with all macports/homebrew questions here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark before you start a mass migration, can we see how this question does here? IMO for now it's in the "technically not off-topic" category, not the "hey that works really well" category.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson - agreed I was really pointing out the implications and the issue that this is probably off topic/too localized for SO. Further I would guess the people who could answer are on SO.

The tag selector on this site and its Meta causes the content container to scroll in Chrome/Firefox, which isn't desired:

The Add Another Answer/Answer your Question button is floated to the left, causing the prompt to receive email notifications appear somewhat awkwardly to the right:



I'm not positive it doesn't end up in the same position on other sides, but the prompt should at least be in line with the button vertically and spaced a little further to the right.

The float: left; on that prompt also causes weird things when you get errors on the ask form:

Thanks for the fresh eyes.


















This is indeed a fairly complicated situation because:


The newer question is lower quality - potentially good content, but there is a lack of all-important details that would narrow the field of options as to what happened
The newer question scores really nicely in Google - perhaps this is because it uses some important words in the title such as "Apple ID" and "hacked". I think some is more likely to find a question with those keywords instead of "compromised" and such.
The newer question also brings in the factor, that, potentially, the OPs contacts were used in calling contacts - this is an element that wasn't introduced in the older question. On the other hand, it could have a complete coincidence.





The older question has a lot of good, qualifying information which is used to determine exactly what happened. 


I think the key element at stake here is the phrase in the newer question where the OP states quite emphatically:


  we received a Facetime call from our own email address and it was a complete stranger


Even though you can Facetime from any email address (@gmail.com, @icloud.com, @hotmail.com, etc. etc), to any email address, it seems strange that someone else could Facetime from the OPs email address. 

Side note: One thing I probably should have mentioned in my answer is that, at least as of iOS 6, one really can't Facetime their own email address.

For the older question, it is obviously possible for anyone to iMessage or Facetime anyone and it seems much less of a "hack" event.

So, as it is right now, I see the questions as sufficiently different.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree they could be different - we'll see - I almost answered with questions back - what address was used exactly but realized that was a commend and it indicated that the question is really too broad to be answered in it's current form. It could be hacking, it could be misunderstanding, it could be spam using a unicode character to look like the OP's email even though it's a different iCloud account. We just can't tell yet, IMO.


















I have asked on the main meta for a fix, but not all sites have this bug. I'll open this bug report here since I care more about a fix here than a general site wide fix of something that I only see here.

This problem still happens on a recent Safari build - Version 6.1 (8537.43.58)

It's one of the supported browsers, so we tend report all bugs on those and sometimes even report browser specific issues with unsupported browsers knowing they are less likely to get fixed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ShaneHsu Google Chrome is also broken - so at least things are consistent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Consistency is important. It's not a bug, but a feature. Hohoho


















That looks like something from before the redesign of /review. (Or an artifact for when a user's account is deleted). Either way, I've not seen any recent reviews by the community user.

Unless you can point to something more recent, I'm inclined to close this as status-completed at this point. It's fascinating, but likely to be a relic from the past.

I can see no reason not to suggest jailbreak if there is no other choice, I would note the downside that the device would not be supported by Apple.

The reason I would suggest this is this site is for Apple hardware and also see this https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1576/is-asking-about-jailbreaking-with-another-os-on-or-off-topic?cb=1question especially https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1576/is-asking-about-jailbreaking-with-another-os-on-or-off-topic?cb=1#comment2952_1576bmike◆ (a moderator)'s comment


  Do you have a specific question in mind or is this just asking for confirmation that with a jailbreak of 299 questions and several policy links that jailbreaking itself is fine we really are OK with jailbreak as a topic


If it gets disputed then I would upvote non jailbreak versions and ask jailbroken answers to fully justify the issue.

Any guidance is good as I don't want to mis-flag a non-issue when doing the reviews.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can think of plenty of reasons to *prefer* non-jailbreak solutions, and plenty of reason to *warn* users of the downsides of jailbreaking, but if you believe the only (or best) way to achieve what the user is trying to accomplish is to jailbreak the device, then yes, that's what you should recommend.

I checked up last week, and during the whole of 2012, 9 CW questions were asked.  The last one was September, almost half a year ago.  I honestly don't understand the view (often from users who are not primarily active on AD) that we are infested with these questions - they are very sparse indeed, and the bad ones are usually pruned PDQ.

Typically, although not always, they are topical to an event, such as the release of new hardware and software.  In these cases, there is a great case that they drive traffic to the site, offer a little infotainment (I hate that word, but...) and foster community and a bit of fun. It's like a mini AD event in itself, and results in a nice chunk of reference that people can and do enjoy "dipping into" at their leisure.

Keep them I say, they are a part of the unique make up of the AD site.  I'd hate to see AD get all homogeneous to the SE template; I see the SE "way" as a guide, not as the law.  If we wanted to do anything, I would say that every new CW uses an agreed format with regards to the phrasing of the question (i.e. the helpful 1 answer per question, please check for an existing entry first, and ammend or edit rather than add a new one, here is how to search etc, and is "owned" by a mod (or 10k user) or the mods in their initial early stages of life to ensure they start life in the manner in which we would wish them to continue.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think some of them (best OS X apps, best iOS apps) tend to rank well in search results giving them impression they're rampant. I'm of the mind they're a blight on the site -- useless to browse when they become lengthy and they tend to capture very place-and-time data as apps move on, but those questions don't because curating them is a heavy burden.


















If you add two spaces after a word and enter a line break/return, the markdown engine will insert a line break automagically. This disables the rewrapping that is designed into the editing system.

So
if 
you
enter
lines
like
this, they wrap.

But
if
you
double
space, then they don't wrap.

There is a girl asking how to update an ipod she "got from the unclaimed baggage".
It's an euphemism to say it's stolen, as lost and found offices won't give unclaimed stuff to random people:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83352/how-to-upgrade-ipod-touch-4g-to-ios-5-6https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83352/how-to-upgrade-ipod-touch-4g-to-ios-5-6

What happened: the question has been redacted to look legitimate and my question "is it stolen?" has been deleted.
Is that right?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Helping thievesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll have a look, but sadly there's not a good way to draw a line around some knowledge. Questions about how things work can and will be used to get around controls by some percentage of people.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi @Magnetic_dud, I saw your answer and initially I had some misgivings about giving an answer. When I first became active in Ask Different, I brought my skepticism. My experience with the active people here have been overwhelmingly positive and reassuring so I've learned to trust their judgment. I hope you won't be discouraged by what happened here, and continue to be active here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Unclaimed baggage" usually doesn't refer to a lost & found situation. Airlines will periodically auction off goods that have gone unclaimed for a sufficiently long time. This is an entirely legal way to get cheap stuff.


















The only thing that seems off in that thread is accusing them of being a thief. They could be someone who found / stole an iPod, but legitimate auctions do happen when unclaimed goods are redistributed.

You could be right, but what if you're wrong and very publicly accusing someone of being a criminal?

In the end, if you ask a thief if they are, they will say no and if you ask a non-thief if they are a thief, they too will say no, but also potentially be upset / offended / have a legitimate complaint about calling their morals into question.

If something is totally, clearly illegal - we often delete / edit it - but when there is room for a legitimate case, we tend to be open to the assumption that people are good and the post is offered in good faith.

Let's see what another moderator thinks. They'll all get notified of this thread now and perhaps they see something differently than I. Perhaps the best thing for you to do is answer the question as you see it being and comment / seek permission or consensus to re-edit that information back into the question. This thread here is a great start. You could also post to the chat room as many high rep users could also help you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As @bmike already pointed out, it's unclear based on the available information whether the user got its iPod by legal or illegal means. The basic question (how do I upgrade an iPod touch 3/4) is legitimate and unless we get other indicators that something is wrong I think we should let the question stand.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll add that you can't stop selling forks just because someone might stick you with one. We can't stop answering questions because the responses are potentially being used for nefarious purposes. When it's clearly nefarious-only we delete it, but otherwise you have to accept that knowledge is power that can be used for good and bad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wouldn't a thief have said that she inherited the phone from Great Aunt Matilda?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: your third paragraph in this answer. Being wrongfully accused infuriates the hell out of a lot of people. However, in the broken justice system of the USA if you get angry, even in a deposition, the judge/court interprets that as evidence that you have been **rightfully** accused, and you are upset b/c you have been *caught*, I was advised by a lawyer. It's a horribly stupid 'rule'. So I would advise people to remain calm when wrongfully accused, by any authority. IME, this even applies to being scolded by a teacher in a classroom. Asking "Then why are you angry?" is painfully dumb!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I should have perhaps just linked to the [site policy on etiquette](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#etiquette) - which is basically, **Civility is required at all times; rudeness will not be tolerated.** So, call someone a thief with grace and courteously if at all possible, no matter what your lawyer advises. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike lol! I was talking about being on the other end (being the accused, not the accuser), but point understood. Though, I wonder if any SE site is the place to discuss the morality of ownership… besides IP, and maybe Workplace, I guess. Then again… Probably anything having to do with user permissions… lol… Maybe every site has to deal with it on some level, though I don't think most deal with it in the main sites FAQ. Haha! That must be why we have meta! Help us all if the thieves start going to meta!

I've been declining a lot of flags about "not an answer" and wanted to ask a straw question to explain why. Pretend I just had my flag declined and am here to ask WTF!?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my flag for "not an answer" declined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I understand you correctly, we should focus on improving (perceived) bad questions and answers with down votes instead of first resorting to flagging for e.g. as "not an answer"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Globalnomad In many cases - yes. Answer down votes to cost you -1 so I understand if people refrain from that except for supremely poor examples of a post, but unuseful and vague / confusing questions can be voted without any reutation penalty. You can look at the mods as we regularly comment (hopefully in a constructive manner) on poor posts if you want to try your hand at that option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike will do. Thanks. As a newbie, I'm still learning the correct way (i.e. not one that leave mess for others to clean up) so any help is appreciated.


















TL;DR - moderators generally don't delete posts until they have several down votes or constructive comments if there's even a hint of an answer contained in the post.
I'm seeing a lot of "not an answer" flags when there are bad answers, answers that lack a reference, wrong answers, or answers that people presumably disagree with or have a pet peeve with certain words.
In a nutshell:

Don't flag if you don't like the answer
Don't flag if the post is an answer, but it's wrong, or basically is a relevant-looking link (link only or brief answers are handled more carefully on AD than described in https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225370/your-answer-is-in-another-castle-when-is-an-answer-not-an-answerYour answer is in another castle: when is an answer not an answer?)
Don't flag if some small part of the answer seems to indicate "me too" since a small edit can fix that and reinforce the part of the answer that is relevant.

Instead:

Vote down rather than flagging it
Do comment or edit wrong posts to make it right or call out politely why you feel it's wrong. Edit when the wrong is subjective and/or minor, comment for clarification when the wrongness is subjective or opinion-based.
Do post a better answer. Demonstrate (kindly if possible) why your answer is correct and perhaps why the other theories or approaches fail by explaining a side effect or benefit to the correct answer you know.
Do vote up and edit the better answers. Voting really helps promote a good answer. Bonus points for voting up the question since it got several people to try and answer it.


On the moderation side, here is how we tend to process things:
Before handling a flag of "not an answer", we pause to look critically and assess the question. Since we want to optimize for questions that allow for (or perhaps even demand) good answers - everyone should be more https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/90704/5472interested in fixing the question if that's the real problem. Rather than delete an answer that points out the question needs help, let's use the tools to fix a question or guide someone that is attempting to move the discussion forward and only delete an answer if it truly is not of better quality than the question itself.
As moderators, we try to keep some order in terms of deleting things that are actually offensive, mean spirited or blatant spam (spam - n. advertising that is either repetitive or totally not relating to the question) . And we are also here to ensure that criticism of specific choices or functions is constructive as opposed to be unsubstantiated accusations or blowing off steam at someone else's expense, so be sure to use the correct flag if that's your primary complaint with a specific post.
Here's a great post that should be flagged as not an answer.

The only way that would be an answer is if someone asked an off-topic question and we would want a flag on the question since I can't really blame the answerer for a mis-placed question.
Here is what a moderator sees when declining a flag when "not an answer" is in play:

So, as you can see, even if an answer is totally wrong, that's not enough for us to delete it in almost all cases. It has to be unsaveable by an edit and we like to see that the bad answer has a down vote or two and hopefully a constructive comment before we like to step in and summarily delete an answer. Even totally wrong answers with a polite, concrete rebuttal is of great use to the community.
Think how many people with a similar wrong answer in their mind could be helped if we kept all the wrong answers online, searchable, but properly down-voted and explained as to how and why the post is incorrect.
Since our site has so few trusted users, the reopen queue is not maintained well, and when a moderator deletes something, it's extremely rare that anyone will see it, let alone have a chance to fix it.
The next time you flag something as "not an answer" - do a check to see if it can instead be voted / commented if the poster has clearly tried to move the discussion forward. Not all answers are right from the get-go, but we need to give new users and the collaborative editing process a chance for some answers rather than just deleting them outright. If a post shows any effort to help others learn, it should not be flagged or deleted.
If you're reading to this point, realize that when you don't comment and don't vote and don't edit before you flag a post as not an answer, you haven't shown any care and just tossed your perceived problem to the moderator team to handle. Moderating is what we signed up to do as volunteers, but the reality is that when 30 flags for NAA lack any effort at community moderation, your flag however well intentioned, can become a problem.
We'd like to avoid patterns of flagging things as NAA without performing any moderation of the posts in question. Try to not load the flag queue with things that you can start to resolve if the community has given you enough reputation to start moderating these posts via vote, comment and edit privileges.

It's more easy to delete these when it's truly not an answer, since that needs no other qualifiers that spam does have. Also, spam has additional sanctions to the poster whereas not an answer just gets deleted if it's not attempting to move the question forward with some relevant details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could you explain why my flag for this one has not had any result?

Absolutely, I agree Macintosh is just a brand of hardware made by Apple. That's the way of reality.

What's wrong with using the real-world identifiers? How about: [apple] is the name of the company, [macintosh] or [mac] is the name of the computer line, [ios] is software that runs on the i-devices such as iPhones, iPods and iPads, [macos] or [osx] is the software that runs on the Macintoshes.

This is how it is in the real world and not very complicated at all. You can use multiple tags anyway.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5apple is too confusing as covers everything on this site and the tag will not be used just for company related questions - anyway this is a very old question look at the tag wikis for how they are used now which is as per @GlennNilsson's answer


















I am new to community so I still don't have good feeling about "should we keep them or delete them", but it's obvious they are popular and liked, which makes it hard or impossible to remove them. Therefore, it is essential to make criteria, expand borders and change the rules.

But there is another very important thing I want to bring your attention to:

These CW topic-lists are all about good tips, tricks, options of a software. There is no list of bad options, disadvantages or missing features!

Without them we don't have complete overview. Criticism can be good or bad, but what is not useful should be deleted.   

Please notice, that most of people would naturally up-vote a list of good tips, while many of them would also down-vote a list of bad or missing features, even though they can be useful. Which is why I believe @bmike suggestion on question-voting is simply not enough here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this up here, it's the better place for these discussions than the main site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are two main reasons which led me to close the question: (a) "bad" is highly subjective, any point brought up in in answer may lead to extended discussion about its relative badness. Compare this to a list of tips where you just pick the ones you like and ignore the rest. (b) I don't see how a list of "bad" features is of benefit to future visitors here. If you miss a feature in OS X or see a better way something could be implement, send feedback to Apple or file a bug (if you have a developer account).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you run in to a bad feature and want a work-around (as your bad-features-in-Finder CW question was prompting) you can post a single question and get a single answer. This is always the better way to get a solution to a problem. CW questions become unwieldily, unsearchable multi-headed monsters in my opinion. Encouraging more of them is not something I think we should be doing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix I agree this is better place for discussion, thanks for guiding.
I would like to ask you both not to exclusively connect this with my previous activity on main site, as I want to express here my general opinion on the question raised.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I wanted to say- "good" and "bad" are both subjective, but seems that this kind of questions are needed. I like the type, I want them on the website as I don't know any other place where to find that kind of info. And there are others who like them, so it is essential to learn how to choose what to keep and what to remove as not useful. And we need lists of "bad". Yes, one can bump on them alone, send feedback and stuff, but what's wrong in sharing experience, just like for the list of "good"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I said, "bad" is highly subjective. The goal of this site is to provide a lot of Q&A to help Apple users. As @IanC said already, if you need a workaround for a "bad" feature, ask a question, get an answer, done. Having a list of things considered to be "bad" by at least someone doesn't help anybody.


















Horrible.  Respectfully, I can't get past horrible as a descriptive word.  Why?

First the argument.  Ask Different is a bad name because new users...  If someone is a new user, they found this board (just like you did).  There are affiliated with the board (just like you are).  What about renaming the board improves the experience for people that are already here?  If the board name was suddenly changed to "rubber baby buggy bumpers," how would that effect people being able to use it, do things on it, ask questions, and get answers?

Next, what's in a name?  If we use the word Apple in our title WE WILL BE SUED!  Imagine, someone calls Apple and says, "look, I tried the remedy on that board of yours, Ask Apple, and it didn't work..."  How many seconds do you think it would be before an attorney had the place shut down?  If ANYONE confused this boards ownership as Apple's that would be trademark infringement.

Last, a new name.  Okay, "Ask Newton?"  Oh wait, that doesn't make it clear that this is an Apple board and not a physics board.  "Ask Granny Smith?"  Then you just have to know that Granny Smith is a stand in for Apple, instead of it being an exchange about the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.  Kind of like you have to know that Ask Different is a play on Think Different.  Look, you are attacking a lot of peoples interest with a VERY bad idea.  Just consider it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why would we be sued? There is http://appleinsider.comb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51. If the board name was suddenly changed to "rubber baby buggy bumpers," it will be bad. If it will be changed to "Apple user", it will reflect the content, which is a very good thing.    

   2. "If we use the word Apple in our title WE WILL BE SUED!" is a myth. 
E.g. I don't think that ACT Apple User Group http://www.actapple.org.au/  was sued for the name.
 Does anyone from SE tried to contact Apple to find a name that descriptive and acceptable by their lawyers?
Note that URL of the site still have an apple inside.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53.your suggestions about "Newton" "Granny Smith" are funny, but more relevant to the current name. 
Don't play on the associations, that are not obvious for many people. 
Remember that many Apple users do not have English  as native language


















First thing to note is that closing a question does not mean getting rid of it. It just means that it is difficult to understand and the poster needs to clarify what they are asking. Also I am writing this not just for @Borderline but to point out similar issues. e.g. there are metastackexchange threads on the problem of close and what it means to new users.

In general you have to make questions and answers understandable - so you do not need perfect English (noone has that) but the question or answer has to be understandable. If the question or answer is understandable then others will improve the English.

You should also to read FAQs etc on how to use the site as you should for any web site you use. (As you don't have the Analytical Badge we can all see you have not done so).

This question has been moved to Meta Ask Different as that where questions about the site go (or for accounts arguably meta stack exchange as account management is the same for all sites.

You haven't done anything. Some user who voted for you had their account deleted, either by their request or due to some other factor. This results in a loss of reputation earned from that account.

If it's any consolation, it just happened to me, too. :-(

The details of user deletion are covered at the page where you ask for user deletion: https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/user-deletionhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/user-deletion

So - unless you were the only time that user voted on anything, this account would have been deleted by Stack Exchange in response to the procedure listed above. Initially I was disappointed when I first noticed I had lost reputation points on this, but after seeing it happen several times, it makes sense to prevent someone from making an account - voting up (or down) a particular user and then leaving. When someone exits - their down votes which took reputation from others are reversed as well as their up votes leaving the voting system as if they never showed up in the first place.

It is apparently the logic of those who make these decisions that the site grants the ability to vote only after you get a vote from someone else and also requires you to not delete your account to keep your votes in play.

we are seeing some Xcode questions. Some are about the code being written and so are off topic here.

However there are more Xcode users on Stack Overflow should we migrate these questions to Stack Overflow?

Tool use questions are explicitly on topic for StackOverflow - see the FAQ which says "software tools commonly used by programmers"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd only migrate something if it wasn't getting attention here, otherwise it's on topic and a-okay to stay here.


















If a question is on-topic here, it remains open. If it is off-topic, it gets closed. On-topic or off-topic, nothing gets migrated unless the OP requests is.

There are a number of questions that would be on-topic at more than one SE site. This is not a bug. If a question is asked here and it is on-topic here, here it is.

I moderate this site, and don't particularly know or care what's on topic on other sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So a user will cut and paste a question from here to another so we get two questions - surely that is not an outcome we wantb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If someone requests migration, I'm willing to migrate, but as I said, I don't know or care what's on topic on sites other than Ask Different, so I'm not about to suggest migration to a site where I don't know what they want. From your account information, @Mark, it's clear you understand Super User and Stack Overflow. You're welcome to suggest migration where it's appropriate. I'm not qualified to do that. Also, more often than not, a question closed as off-topic here wouldn't be a good fit AS ASKED on other sites; while off-topic is an easy close reason, such questions usually need more work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark - In general, closing a question can sometimes result in migration, but not always. As a mod on another site, I always prefer it when other sites *ask us* before migrating a question; it sometimes saves us having to close a bad question when it arrives, which can be somewhat dizzying for new users.


















I was wondering "why doesn't Apple have a native package manager", so I asked the question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/86075/2153Do open source licenses restrict Apple's ability to provide a native package manager?. But the question was closed as "not constructive".

In general, is my approach on-target?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - by being more specific, it helps everyone know what precisely is on the table for consideration. I was going to say, Apple has thousands of lines of open source code delivered as part of iOS and OS X, so unless you were going to address and justify what makes a package manager's license so much more onerous than ssl, BSD and the rest of Darwin - focusing on a broad "OSL" is toxic seems like a problem with the original question.


















On first glance you can probably do nothing to give this question a chance. Why, you ask, well:


this site focuses on providing specific answers on specific questions. Any question about package managers has kind of a theoretical touch so any answer might be right
whatever is discussed around this topic will have zero influence neither on Apple  nor on anything else
in a way there are already some package managers available (homebrew, macports), so the question is answered by real implementations
OS X is not Linux or BSD, the Mac App Store  solves the problem quite nicely for most people


What you should maybe ask yourself first is which specific problems a package manager does solve, how (if at all) they are already solved currently in OS X space and what (if anything) is left unsolved for most users or at least for yourself. This may lead to an answerable question at the end.

By contrast, brew installed MySQL but did not put it on the default system path. I want to be able to modify a build script for OSX, an minimize such extra steps as much as possible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this case it might be better to ask exactly what you need to know/do (or to contribute to brew directly to add this ability). A question about the impact of OSS licenses on Apple product abilities is too broad to help you here.


















I didn't handle that flag, but I agree with the result.

Here is the relevant https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#promotionFAQ on promotion.


  Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, so be it. 


In this case, it's a single post and the user name clearly discloses that this is promotional. We will certainly monitor that account to ensure it isn't here to solely post promotional content. Everyone is free to down vote that item if they feel it's not relevant, but for my opinion - this seems like an appropriate promotion where the solution is exactly what the OP is asking for in a software recommendation.

Additionally, when a user posts their first answer ever on a site, it's to be understood that perhaps they haven't read all of the FAQ, let alone the promotional portion so we almost always gently point people to the FAQ until we have a pattern of promotion. With a pattern, other tools are brought to bear and in this case, it would be premature to assume all posts from that account will be solely promotional.

We very much appreciate the flags on spam - but sometimes it takes several posts to ensure we don't censor otherwise well meaning fans of a product of being here to promote one item or agenda.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Spam is something unwanted. Promoting a product unsolicited or when it is not desired. If a person makes software that accomplishes a goal you're inquiring about (figurative you), surely anyone can let you know what's out there, not just "normal *"unaffiated"* people"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is even more true in this case where the website linked to isn't even a product, but just a site someone maintains that addresses the particular problem the OP asked about. Telling someone who asks a question "You could jailbreak and update your hosts file, but you'll need to keep changing it to stay on top of shifting patterns" is helpful, but saying that AND adding "and I've got a website where I post a current version of that hosts file" is even more helpful. Far from being spam, it's a good and selfless answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson That user *should* explicitly disclose his/her affiliation with that site in the answer, though. (The username indicates it, but it is not explicitly stated as required by the [promotion policy](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#promotion)). I'm not sure why no one has asked them to do so (and then flagged the post if they don't after a couple of days). Maybe the rules are interpreted differently here than on some other SE sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The promotion policy applies to products. This is a dynamically updated answer to the question. Saying "my answer is … but the details change periodically; if you go to http://url you'll find a site where someone keeps the current version of the answer to the question updates" is an awesome answer. If the poster is actually the person who does the work, sure, I'd love to see that explicitly stated, but I don't see "I'm going to answer your question here" as product promotion.


















It seems this site doesn't support LaTex
Then how to type math symbol here?
I tried to type $\wedge \vee \neg$,and still nothing happened.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This site doesn't support LaTex?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll mark this as status-bydesign, but I would encourage anyone that wants to build support for this to answer this question with specific posts on the Ask Different site where having this support would help. I'm sure we could build consensus for a change if there were a documented need of the site not working well due to lack of LaTex support.


















You are correct; this site does not support LaTeX. 

Most https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30559/latex-in-stack-overflowStack Exchange sites have opted out of supporting this LaTex extensions since it slows the site access for each and every user of the site whether they need the math rendering or not.

In general, there is little to no demand for this "feature" in the context of a web site answering questions about Apple products.

If you did need to insert special characters (which your question didn't really need to specify; saying "special characters" or "logic symbols" would have worked), the answer to how to insert them on this website is the same as the answer to your question about how to insert them in pages: use the character palate.

In your case, the three symbols are all standard unicode under Math Symbols:


\wedge is ⋀ - the N-ARY LOGICAL AND character
\vee is ⋁ - the N-ARY LOGICAL OR character
\neg is ¬ - the NOT SIGN character

You don't need to know the answer in order to write the question. :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also - this meta discussion explains that everyone's site load times are increased to support it's use on just a few posts and answers. I'll edit this answer to have that link.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This answer is too perfect,you even give the expiation of LaTex code I wrote


















So I was just going to ask a question about the app on Apple's homepage, and I realized it could be off-topic or not constructive or whatever.

I was going to provide a photo like this, and ask for the name of the app in the right side.


Anyway, is this kind of questions allowed here?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions like "what's this app?" allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll answer, but feel free to edit into this post "What next?" The initial version of this could be a dead end if there were no more requirements than "what is this app?" but it also could set the stage for an awesome question.


















The question is not the result of merge as far as I can see (there would be a note for that).

Getting multiple answers recommending the same or similar solutions happens regularly (there are other questions with the same issue). Sometimes it's just a timing issue (e.g. the two highly voted GIMP answers only have a four minutes gap), sometimes it's just the result of users not reading the other answers (or even competing for reputation). If you want to delete your own one, feel free to do that (personally I wouldn't bother with deleting it, it even got upvoted). There is a fourth one recommending GIMP which was deleted by the owner (that's why you can't see it) after realizing that others answered the same way already.

As for the answers with the commercial solutions: The asker didn't go into details about he is looking for free as "at no cost" or for free as "significantly cheaper than Photoshop", so they still are helpful. Don't upvote, maybe downvote even, but they are close enough to provide an answer that I wouldn't act on a "not an answer" flag.

In both cases it's a good example on how the voting system works on AD. Good answers (e.g. both the GIMP ones with their screenshots etc.) get voted up, bad answers (or those somehow missing the point) get down voted or at least not up voted so much. I see no need for any additional moderation activity here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The reason I think it is a merge is that I don't think I would have given a simple answer on GIMP a year after at least one illustrated one (or else my mind is really going)


















Let's say I am developing an app or a service to run on or in conjunction with Apple hardware or software, I'm wondering what questions I can ask here and what I should ask elsewhere.

I've looked at the https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#questionsFAQ for Ask Different and the https://stackoverflow.com/faq#questionsFAQ for Stack Overflow and sometimes it's not clear which, if either of these sites I should bring a specific question.

For instance, If I'm https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88802/what-ios-setting-general-usage-indicatestruggling to make sense of iOS's Storage pane or the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89650/delete-application-from-iphone-5-1-simulatoriOS simulator is not behaving the way I want - Are these questions OK here or should I take it elsewhere?

Additionally, I may have a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90055/how-do-you-create-an-ios-app-that-supports-a-bookshelfquestion that has both policy and implementation details and wonder where the line between on and off-topic lies for both here and http://stackoverflow.comStack Overflow.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I'm a developer, can I ask questions here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If someone can be elected moderator, earn 53K reputation on this site, and still need to ask this, our documentation is really a mess! Or maybe this is a leading question to generate a great answer we can point people to :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm clearly asking this as a proxy for others (being that goofy guy out there "leading by example"), and even though I have some ideas where the line should lie - I'm looking to get several voices in fleshing out the details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course. I didn't read your name when I asked the question, and was just startled to see it was from you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I initially started to write this as a draft FAQ, but we're not there yet. I'd rather see several edge questions get discussed / dissected here rather than in comment threads on the main site. In time, we can document a Q&A here to be tagged [tag:faq]


















Yes. Please ask your question - even if you're not sure where it fits. We have users that will flag, vote, comment and close it if it isn't detailed enough or in the wrong place.

That being said, it's best to do a little research of both sites to avoid too much confusion if you asked a too user-centric question on Stack Overflow or ask a too much developer-centric question here.

The example is an easy one to answer: This is end user functionality (what is the meaning of the number displayed behind each application) so this fits perfectly into AskDifferent.  

If the question is rather "why does the number keep growing in my self-developed app", StackOverflow is definitively the better (and right) place because sooner or later it turns into coding and debugging. But they probably want to see a bit more analysis done upfront than just a "help, my app is eating memory".

In extension to the topics already covered in the FAQ, I currently use the following rules of thumb: If Objective C (or any other programming language besides shell scripting or AppleScript) code or debugging is involved, it belongs to stackoverflow.com. Everything else is usually fine on AD as well.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My initial thoughts are the linked question is perfect for here. Yes, a developer is asking it. Yes, they eventually need to come to grips with what specific architectural choices Apple made and they have made to cause their version of their app to use 36 MB of space. Those detailed questions belong on Stack Overflow since they are not iTunes-Connect service questions. However, all users of iOS will benefit from the asking of what makes an app use up space on iOS. So, I see us steering that question to keep it broadly applicable and help the OP refine the area for a follow-on question on SO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've added a second real question to my "question" here. I think it's mostly about how Xcode works to make a simulator and of use, but again - I'm looking to paint the edges of what should be in-play and what should be out of play.


















This is a site aimed primarily at end users of Apple products rather than developers. That said, it isn't a site NOT for developers. There are plenty of questions that are of interest to both developers and end users. Just because a person is a developer doesn't mean their question is out of place here.

If a question is likely to produce answers that are helpful to people using, administering, or maintaining Apple hardware or software, that's on target for this site. If the answers are likely to be helpful (or comprehensible) only to people who create software for Apple products, I'd say that falls outside the scope of this site.

I'd say the test is to ask yourself who might find your answer helpful. If the answer is just you personally, the question is too localized. If the answer is just programmers, the question is off-topic for this site. If the answer could be helpful to non-programmers who use Apple products, please do ask it here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that lots of developer questions shouldn't be here. I've added an Xcode question to the thread above, but I wonder if you could link to some questions that are clearly off-topic in this answer so that we all can know what a question that is helpful only to developers might look like in practice.


















How do I use the search on AskDifferent to search all stackexchange sites.

Example: I have a question and would like to know if an answer exists in here or on StackOwerflow, Meta StackOwerflow...ect...

I know how to use Google, and how to switch the sites, but wondering if there is time saving approach within the AskDifferent.

Joel Spolsky has said that Google is the basically the home page for Stack Exchange (paraphrasing).

Legal constraints around jailbreaking/unlocking are different around the globe, so we either allow all or nothing. Personally I would go with the "allow all" option unless there is a strong legal reason that StackExchange Inc will get in trouble that way. 

The biggest issue we have with the "unlock" questions is actually the removal of spam answers they seem to attract...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, I put those in parens for precisely that reason. So I'm still interested in seeing this addressed specifically in the FAQ, perhaps with that footnote. However, if having them in the FAQ will indeed increase the footwork for mods, then it's a no-go. Was either in the FAQ previously and caused a suspected spike in such answers/questions? It sounds like this is just a persisting issue that perhaps is too annoying to even risk aggravation?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I doubt that spammers care about the FAQ, they just pick "unlock" questions and post their standard 'answers'. This should have no influence on whether we put something into the FAQ or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, I guess we'll see what the other mods say. Thanks! And, to be sure, only 392 people besides myself have the analytical badge, teehee… of course, countless others have read only a couple or more sections, not the whole thing.


















Let's assumed I've asked a question which got quite a number of comments by other AD users trying to help me in narrowing down my problem and/or resolving it. I've partially answered the follow-up questions directly in the comments and partially edited my question to add additional information.

After a lot of back and forth, a moderator joined the discussion, temporarily closed the question and asked me to rework the question to reflect the newly gathered information before reopening it.


Why is he doing that?
What should I as an asker do now?
Could there be better ways to handle such situations?


PS: This was inspired by https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89184/using-the-ipad-as-an-audio-slavethis question but also is valid for similar issues we had in the past (and will have in the future).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A moderator closed my question and asked me to edit/rework it, so what should I do?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I (obviously) have an opinion here, so the question is asked primarily to give other moderators and users an opportunity to raise their voice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It ia all down to the concept of close and how people see it as final but it is not on SO - see several meta.stackexchnage posts. Also is this not covered in meta.stackexchnage - should we be repeating the debates from there?


















Came across https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89928/how-to-learn-objective-c-languagethis question about learning Objective-C. While the FAQ explicitly disallows "Code-level programming questions", this is clearly not a code-level question, and I think there's some value in it, particularly if it were edited slightly to be a bit less open-ended (i.e. "What are some good resources to start learning Objective-C").

Two main rationales for this:


This type of question would be (and https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=how+to+learn+objective-chas been) closed on StackOverflow, as it's not a code-specific question.
I think we should encourage others to explore the Apple ecosystem beyond just using software. I think lots of people using Ask Different have been exposed to the command-line and scripting for the first time, it seems like the perfect place to introduce what can be done with programming.


Again, I'm not advocating for any programming/code-specific questions, but a general "where to started" type question seems like a useful resource for others to me.

Thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Allow "How to Learn Objective-C"-Type Questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you, thank you for asking this. The close reason I chose should probably have been - not a real question since as written, it's not even remotely answerable without guessing far too much about what the OP is trying to solve.


















That's a terribly open-ended and unanswerable question that's been linked to and I think it exemplifies why we don't want these questions on Ask Different.

When someone asks, "How do I learn this language?" they're asking something that is so broad, so without a canonical response, that it just doesn't fit the Stack Exchange format. It is going to get closed no matter where you post it on the SE network.

If the person who asked that question could narrow it down so it might have a single, clear answer they could post it on https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/ -- it's better suited for that site. Though even there you have to avoid the open-ended "help me learn" type questions as https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/faqper their FAQ:


  and it is not about...
  
  
  general workplace issues, office politics, résumé help (check out The Workplace instead),
  implementation issues or programming tools (ask on Stack Overflow instead),
  what language/technology you should learn next, including which technology is better,
  what project you should do next,
  what book you should read next,
  career advice, salary or compensation,
  personal lifestyle, including relationships, and non-programming activities
  


If, what you really want to ask, is something as vaguely-answerable as "how do I learn this language", I think what you want is not Stack Exchange but something more akin to a traditional forum. Where you can have a dialog and and a back-and-forth conversation about the open-ended-ness that is learning something new like a computer language.

Taken at its most literal, then yes it is very open ended, but my interpretation was the questioner was looking for more a starting point to do some research, which to me seems valuable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even that edit has no *right* answer. It's almost leading towards a community wiki question. Something I've made no secret of loathing in the SE universe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, I suppose we're not going to reach a consensus here, as some of my favourite Ask Different questions end up as community wiki ones. No *right* answer doesn't mean there can't be useful *good* answers, and bad answers can still be filtered out via voting or improved.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@robmathers if it helps, I think I am very much an outlier in my disklike of community wiki questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Googling "How to Learn Objective-C"](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=how%20to%20learn%20objective%20c) returns a bunch of very good hits on the first page alone, I don't think a not very Q&A like thread on AD does provide additional value anyway.


















It's not considering the @-reference as part of the comment. Not to mention that after clicking submit, the @-reference to Greg's username is going to be stripped out. Since you're commenting on his answer, explicitly referencing the OP is unnecessary as they will be notified of a new comment on their answer.

While the gesture of thanking the user in words is appreciated, voting has a more tangible effect. Give the up-vote a click and/or accept his answer, and call it done.

A question very similar to others was asked and is already getting some flags, so I wanted to have a short discussion here to discuss the merits of re-opening this question:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90768/adobe-creative-cloud-mac-app-alternativesAdobe Creative Cloud: Mac App Alternatives?

As a moderator, I closed it since it:


Appears to be not focused on a practical problem - instead it's asking for lots of opinions and value decision trade offs
Is very broad. Adobe has 12 products in CS 6, 4 major bundles of each product, some products have a Pro and non-Pro version, and the pricing is all over the board. Student, Educator, Pro, Volume. Even if you asked which of these you should buy is a major decision and possibly too broad unless the person asking has done some serious work to explain what they need.
As asked, people looking for specific recommendations for the lesser products won't find this question or any gem answers that are provided. (look at the last 5 pages of some of the other popular wiki questions on the site. There are great answers that came late and never will get any votes since no one can find them. By asking smaller questions, these great answers get the attention they deserve to rise and be seen whereas one monster question drowns out all answers that fall off the first page and start out below the fold)


I see it better for the site to have several questions asking specific questions, but also realize that many like these questions so I wanted to hear from both sides rather than handle flags and votes one off on the main site.

Again, I want to thank you so much for asking it and being excited about the site and about generating good relevant content. 

We can use this question to work on some blog post outlines and the other question to hash out what to do with the original question.

The log off function rarely works for me. But you can get to it on an iPad. 



You can flag a post of yours or ask here and moderators can help by forcing a log out. We can invalidate your account's sessions which is handy if someone feels an account has been compromised. I've cleared your server session cookies and the system was only tracking one session, so you should now have to log in everywhere you browse the next time you browse the site.

From the perspective I can relate to that moderator, I believe your question was not clear enough. For this reason most of the material posted to it (comments, answers etc.) took up unnecessary space in the database(s) of Stack Exchange. Had your question been asked/posted clearly without needing additional clarifications (through comment-answer pairs), material posted would be much more valuable - to you and to other users with a similar question/problem.

What happened has happened, so asking you to edit your question to clarify your issue would not help save the already consumed space in the database because comments have already peen saved. However, if still your question does not seem clear enough, closing the question makes sense. The message I get from this action is: Revise your question in a way that it won't need additional clarification derived from the confusion that obscure or missing information will cause.

Was thinking about putting this as a question (if of humor) on Ask Different

Just came across this as an alternative recycling option:

Is this really a viable option (if extreme) & what other recycling methods exist for an old G5 ?

I was under the impression that the G5 / Mac Pro chassis were simply anodized aluminum which wouldn't be more or less harmful than aluminum foil or aluminum pots and pans. I'd want to see a heat sink grill pattern for maximum geek points - that round waffle pattern seems odd for grilling.


















My definition on dead questions are as followed

The user asking haven't been around for long. (Correct answer may or may not exist, but no best answer was chosen by the asker)

The question isn't active for a long long time, no more answers, no more comments.

Is there any clean-up mechanism for these kind of questions? As no best answer is chosen, they are left open even if there is already a good answer to it or answering it doesn't make sense anymore.

For example, this is marked as a dead question to me:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53940/problem-adding-large-surround-sound-wav-file-to-itunes?rq=1https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53940/problem-adding-large-surround-sound-wav-file-to-itunes?rq=1

The asker haven't been around for months, and any answers to it will not be marked as best, therefore leaving it open forever.

I am interested to know what is the correct etiquette (if such exists) when downvoting a question: 


Do you downvote a question, and then make a comment ?
Do you make a comment first, and then downvote immediately afterwards (or indeed wait a certain time period before applying the downvote) ?
Or is it irrelevant which way around the downvote/comment is undertaken ?
Indeed what are the consequences (if any) of applying a downvote to a question without making any comment whatsoever ?


I believe this to be an important question, so would appreciate clarification in the above regard.

Edit

I forgot obviously this applies to downvoting with regards to the respective answer(s) as well (and not just questions).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Downvoting Etiquette: With or Without Making A Comment?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd suggest that this question is relevant for upvoting too.
We are too often focused on the negative side of the coin.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I upvoted this question because I asked myself the same one: what's the key difference function between up or down voting, and positive or negative comments.


















The order of coment and downvotes does not really matter as the reader is very unlikely to see the question between the two actions.

However more imprtantly is the last question "Indeed what are the consequences (if any) of applying a downvote to a question without making any comment whatsoever ?" and the answer is none, that is how StackExchange sites are meant to be used. Downvote if you think the question is not good, you do not need to say why.

See many meta stackexchange threads https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/encouraging-people-to-explain-downvoteshere and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/55324/downvoters-and-commentshere and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/138189/is-it-ok-to-indicate-that-i-downvoted-in-a-commenthere

And in general it's preferable to upvote the questions/answers you like.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Makes senseb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Disagree.  One may not *need* to say why they downvoted, but one *ought* to say why (constructively).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisW.Rea Agreed. Also is there a point where after a certain number of downvotes, a question is removed from the site ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Simon - questions I do not think are removed just for downvotes - however if the question gets so many downvotes there is probably enough wrong with it to be eligible for downvote reasons.


















I don't have an answer or ETA on whether the developers here would ever make such a change site wide (or Ask Different wide if possible), but this might make a fabulous question on the main site to ask if it's possible to tweak Safari to ensure ⌘+H goes to Finder/Safari as opposed to Safari's window contents (in this case javascript code executing in the mini editor environment).

The Image button on this site gives the dialogue below, which mentions the ability to paste in an image.



However, I can't get this to work in Safari (6.0.4) on OS X (10.8.3).  I can drag a file in, but I'd like to be able to use cmd-shift-ctrl-4 to put a screenshot on the clipboard, then paste that in, because that feels a little faster.  However, pressing cmd-v seems to do nothing.

  Am I missing something?


Only that you need to save the file to disk before uploading it to the site. The browser can't upload the contents of your system clipboard to imgur, which is where images end up getting hosted for the StackExchange network.

When it says "paste or drag-and-drop" they mean you can paste a path to a file on your hard drive. When you paste or drag-and-drop the image the dialog gets the path to the file and uses that to push the file to imgur. It doesn't get the contents of the file directly.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pasting a path as well as drag-and-drop don't seem to work reliable with Safari (didn't test with other browsers), at least I got mixed results in the last few weeks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think that's entirely true. [Imgur](http://imgur.com) supports pasting from your clipboard. Pretty sure StackExchange implemented it in the same manner.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JasonSalaz I just created an account at Imgur. I copied a screenshot to my clipboard, then went to my Imgur "images" page and pressed cmd-v, as instructed on the website, but Edit > Paste was greyed out and Safari just beeped :( I use a Flash blocker... I turned that off, but it made no difference. What steps do you follow to paste from the clipboard into Imgur?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JasonSalaz I was unable to paste to imagur from the clibpoard when I tried today.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JasonSalaz likewise, has never worked for me in Safari. This goes back to what I said about access to the clipboard contents. Looks like it's inconsistent between browsers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I believe this is a Safari problem.


















If it doesn't work, this sounds like a Safari issue. Running those steps just worked in Chrome. After I hit paste, the dialog box changed to this:



Which allowed me to click confirm and upload the image. You may want to click within the whitespace of the dialog box in order to ensure that it has focus, and then hit ⌘v
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks: I've just tried Chrome, and that works as you describe for me. Now... any idea how to report the issue to stackexchange?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Based off your other comment, I don't think it's StackExchange's problem to fix. Sounds like Safari doesn't support clipboard image pasting.


















I've noticed Ask Different's CSS is much less legible than other Stack Exchange sites:

Pretty selector:



Not pretty selector:



(produced by hovering over a choice)

Could we change it so that the text is darker than the grey circle shown upon hover?

Edit: Here I've used Chrome's dev tools to change

.page-sizer a.page-numbers {
    color:#ccc;
}


To:

.page-sizer a.page-numbers {
    color:rgb(111,111,111);
}


Here's the results:

Had I write access and it didn't break something else, I'd ship your change.


















My initial reaction is that this is a Safari issue.  It's not just "you can't paste stuff in Safari", because https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/SafariJSProgTopics/Tasks/CopyAndPaste.htmlSafari purportedly supports the Javascript Cliboard APIs.  I've marked this as [status-review] until I can pin this down for sure and will update this answer when I have something more definitive to share.

Update:

This does appear to be a browser issue.  I've reproduced the described behavior.  I also tried on imgur to see if it would respond in the same way, and it does: dong...nothing happens.  I experimented a bit in jsfiddle to see if the event is handled as documented, and I don't think it is.  I'll keep looking into this for a while, but unless something I didn't already know is brought to my attention, I expect to status-decline this later this week.

WWDC 2018 announced new major OS releases - iOS 12, macOS 10.14 (Mojave), watchOS 5 and tvOS 12.

All are scheduled to be released in the fall of 2018 to the public. 

Can we ask specific questions about these releases? If not, what can we ask about before these products are released to the general public?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are iOS 12, macOS 10.14, watchOS 5 or tvOS 12 (beta) questions OK?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As someone who has access to the iOS 9 and El Capitan preview images, I would also like to point out that the content is covered by an NDA which prevents anyone from talking about features that haven't already been announced or sharing screenshots.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - my understanding of the NDA last year was that anything publicly linked or spoken of in the sessions was OK to speak about, but that you can't show anyone the system or reveal anything not covered. Also, you can't republish / re-show anything from the content unless you have written permission from Apple. I don't know if 2015 has the same - so be cautious if you have agreed to an NDA before posting here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems to be still relevant, but naughty Community thinks otherwise ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Allowing iOS 9 and El Capitan questions « Ask Different Blog](http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/) (2015-08-12) – refers to this question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why the [featured] "battle" in the edits?


















This was posted so that we could have an announcement on the community bulletin. We can edit and reuse this next year unless it causes grief to anyone. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, Community◆ bumping this might be a form of grief. I'm upvoting to keep that from happening again. :-(


















My intent isn't to fix any of these questions, but if that happens and they get reopened, that's totally fine and people can look at the revisions to understand why / when close and open happens.

The open questions really aren't about iOS 7 at all. The AirDrop one is a long standing question about a feature that is concrete and well documented. It just so happens that Apple publicly announced to the world that the feature will be in iOS 7, so I tagged it iOS7 and left it open.

The other two open ones are more about someone that jailbroke (or was a legitimate developer) and they need to get back to the released / supported configuration. Yes, iOS 7 made a peripheral, perhaps key part in their situation, but the question isn't really about iOS 7 - it's just part of the lead-up.

The closed questions are really about using iOS 7 now - before it's released to the public. That's the sort of question the prohibition on pre-release and beta software was designed to make out of scope. Some of these will be good questions, reopened promptly when iOS 7 is released, others have problems with other criteria for a good question, so they might need edits or changes before they get opened - even after iOS 7 is released. But the focus on iOS 7 is reason now to close them.

Hopefully this helps and also provides a place to discuss this should other examples arise or edits change the questions referenced here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mike, would it help if we assign a specific tag (e.g. "wait-for-ios7") to the "to be reopened" questions  when we close them? Would make it easier to communicate the intent (and also help us to find them again in fall).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's trivial to find them with search, and abusing the tag system that way seems more counterproductive than just dealing with the light work to close now and comment why. Once the OS is released, it's easy work to add a second comment explaining why the question is still closed and many questions get reopened by site members in my experience without even needing moderators to do any work.


















Simon, this is a great question for the main site. It will be even better if you put to words one or two things that have caused you to be anxious. It doesn't matter if they are good reasons, bad reasons, but will help others searching on google for those exact concerns to find your question and seek help like you have.

Let's work out the details of your question here on meta so that you have a very good experience asking how to learn on the main site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Its just I've never used it so don't really know how to start, or if I enter the text incorrectly, how to easily change the correction....If I'm making sense. Or to reverse the terminal hack if necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect, Let's pick one question on the main site you wonder about or one task you'd like to learn how to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thats fine, here one http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/91722/disable-dashboard-in-mountain-lionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect - so I'm going to be a bit dumb now. Rather than guess what you want - are you curious how to use the command to make that change or do you want to learn how the answerer knew what to do?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Primarily how to use the command in order to make the required change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect! You have a great case to ask for help in understanding how to accomplish that task. You can say you want to implement this and don't know where to start. We can take it from there. Link to your question here if I miss it or it doesn't get a good answer / runs into issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Still haven't had time this weekend, shall get round to it during the coming week.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No rush - the site will be here in a week and hopefully in a month too /b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I hope it will be here for many years to come :)


















I'm inclined to edit the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp page on what questions are on and off-topic.

The list off-topic items has this category:

Installing or using Apple operating systems on 
non-Apple hardware (and most other 
explicitly unlicensed use of product)


The second part of this - unlicensed use seems to be adequately covered in the site wide legal agreement that all users presumably agree to be bound. We as community moderators (elected and those that moderate by virtue of reputation) already can vote to close and delete things based on the primary terms of use.

That leaves us with the first part - "using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware" - where the prevailing opinion seems to me to be that we should allow these questions on the site:


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2/can-one-ask-hackintosh-questions-on-ask-differentCan one ask Hackintosh questions on Ask Different?


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/26/robert-s-ciaccioRobert S Ciaccio has net of 30 votes for https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/23/5472"no reason whatsoever to keep these questions off the site" and I've got net of 10 votes for https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/521/5472"there's no evidence that a ban should be in place" (which I wrote well before nominating myself for election as a moderator) and now that I've seen what the workload is, I support being tolerant of good technical questions even if they involve jailbreaking or hackintosh situations.

Is there any reason to keep that entire sentence (or even parts of it)?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the help page remove the prohibition on hackintosh?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would add, given the diversity of answers - it's not even clear what a "hackintosh" question is. Is it about _how to modify hardware or software_ so that OS X runs on non Mac hardware or is it about supporting people that have figured the above out?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've only really been active on the site for a couple of months, but this is something I have wondered about regularly. I can see the arguments for and against including _hackintosh_ questions. For what it's worth, I have seen quite a few hackintosh questions in the [Super User](http://superuser.com) community, and a few in the [Hardware Recommendations](http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com) community as well. So perhaps if we continue not to allow them here, we should have a 'policy' of referring them to either of those if the OP's question fits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why have you suddenly decided to "feature" this question, without either updating the body of the question itself or updating your previous answer that seemed to have resolved the debate to the negative? In other words, what's the point of bringing up what appears to be an old, settled question? If something has changed, either in reality or in your mind, you should provide that context.


















We allow questions around jail breaking iOS. seems fairly hypocritical to not allow hackintosh questions in light of that. Both are of dubious legality. Why make the hard distinction?

I say lose the sentence and leave the general terms of services to cover the legal aspects such as they might arise.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Jailbreaking iOS is legally quite different from Hackintosh installs, as it is explicitly legal (in the US) under the exemption to the DMCA issued by the Library of Congress in 2010. Hackintosh installs are *not* covered by this exemption.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Building a Hackintosh, running a Hackintosh, etc, will attract a HUGE amount of computer/hardware specific questions that won't be too useful. There's an [entire forum](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/) for that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LessPop_MoreFizz can you provide something canonical to support that?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. [Here are the specifics of the DMCA exemption for Jailbreaking. It's narrowly tailored to Mobile Phones, and more specifically, to modifications to firmware to allow additional software to be installed.](http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-169.html) Meanwhile, the courts have [previously held](http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2009/11/14/apple-wins-clone-suit/) that Apples protections of Mac OS X preventing the installation on foreign hardware *are* covered by the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions. Jailbreaks and Hackintosh are *emphatically not* legally equivalent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Pystar judgement didn't decide that hackintosh's were illegal, it decided that Pystar couldn't _modify OS X_. The modification created a derivative work which was contrary to the license agreement. As long as a hackintosh doesn't modify OS X to make it work, it remains legal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not worried about hackintosh questions from a legality standpoint. It's not illegal to talk about hackintoshes, and the legality of making one varies by jurisdiction. If legality were the only grounds, I'd agree with you Ian. But I think @jaume makes the critical point: what is the effect on overall site quality. On those grounds, I'm inclined to leave them off the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LessPop_MoreFizz, my recollection is that the DMCA exemption no longer applies -- while there used to be an exemption, the Library of Congress recently removed it in their latest rulemaking.  Do you have any reference to the contraryb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@D.W. [Looks like the original exemption was renewed as of 10/26/12](http://www.copyright.gov/1201/). In the same ruling, an exemption to allow for similar interoperability for computing devices appears to have been explicitly rejected.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LessPop_MoreFizz, thanks for the reference.  I had misremembered some of the details.  It looks like the Library of Congress renewed the exemption for phones but not for tablets, so now there is no DMCA exemption for jailbreaking of iPads (also, there is no longer any DMCA exemption for carrier-unlocking new iPhones).  As a result, jailbreaking an iPad is about as dubious (legally) as a Hackintosh install. I think this undermines your argument about why jailbreaking is different, unless you are prepared to argue that we should ban questions related to jailbreaking iPads or unlocking iPhones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@D.W. I'd happily be prepared to make that argument. I suspect however, that, given the technical similarities between the jailbreaking of the iPad and iPhone, I'd be far enough in the minority that I'm inclined to just shut up and pick my battles however.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@D.W. It should also be noted that unlocking of cellular phones to allow carrier interoperability *is also covered* by a separate and distinct exemption in the same 2012 ruling.


















One occasionally encounters comments to the effect of "Why the downvote? It is not useful to downvote without commenting."

Are users who vote down a question or answer expected or required to comment explaining their reasons for their vote?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does someone need to leave a comment on a question or answer when voting it down?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm - are you intending to stake out new ground compared to this post? http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1693b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'Doh. How did I not find that in my search?!?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've got several of these on the main meta - search, search, ask - then see the related list and get duped again.


















I think if this site was only about encouraging people to votes then you could give a point for an upvote. But it is not. Its about getting answers to your questions. The voting system is a mechanism to try and help qualify an answer or question.

I understand the need for anonymous voting. But that does not mean I think not commenting on down votes for answers is helpful.  But I also understand that if every on down voted commented it would become a mess.

So we are stuck with the good things and bad things because no one solution is going to fully help the site function.

So Can I suggest a something else that is added to the voting buttons.

Clicking the up or down vote reveals  a popover which gives the more reasons to why the voter is voting. "This Answer is not useful", "This Answer does not work".."Other" and so on.

The vote counte number changes. But the reason is added to a Poll. Which can be viewed by other readers if they want to see what the overall reasons for the votes are. This in some where may give a clearer indication to the anonymous voting than the simple one we have now, be more helpfull and without causing the clutter of duplicate comments.

Small update for mark's comment.

And imo better than a all encompassing "This Answer is not useful.   But anyway only a suggestion..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Out of those down votes  "is correct but badly constructed" is that a down vote? "is incorrect." is the same as "dose not work as described" and is not useful is more of a flag isn't it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Possibly. But "Does not work as described" to me is there is a fault in the answer as opposed  to the answer works but is badly written. If this idea was ever taken up I am sure the wording would be worked out to convey useful meaning. But I doubt it will..:-)


















I wanted to post a main announcement here:


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasonsClosing changes: on hold, unclear, too broad, opinion-based, off-topic reasons, bye-bye to Too Localized


These changes are going to be a very nice benefit to both new users and old users - especially once we all get a week or two to see how to best use the new close reasons:


When your question is closed, if you edit it within 5 days - it's bumped to the reopen queue without anyone needing to cast the first vote. Additionally, the text will say [on hold] rather than [closed] to remind everyone that we expect most questions to be saved and re-opened if the problem identified can be fixed with a proper edit.
The specific problems with a post are much more specific: duplicate, off-topic, unclear what you are asking, too broad, primarily opinion based


All this is a common change to all sites on Stack Exchange. What's specific to Ask Different is that we can come up with one or two custom "off-topic reasons" and I'd like to knock around any and all reasons we'd like to have listed for all users to pick when casting a close vote.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Changes are coming to the close process. What custom reasons might help this site best?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was grumbling about these changes, then I realized that [I actually suggested](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/171491/170961) the idea of on hold. I'm sure other people suggested it also; I'm not claiming to have invented the idea, but obviously at some point I thought it was a good idea :-)


















It appears the the https://apple.stackexchange.com/FAQAsk Different FAQ is gone, redirecting to a generic help page. 
I now see that there is https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topica page about what is on-topic for the site, but that page is far less prominent than the old FAQ was.

There's some great explanations of how Stack Exchange works, but it's too hard to find what's specifically appropriate for Ask Different.

The help page is a great resource, but it doesn't mark well enough the function of the first section of the FAQ about what is on-topic here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The page http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic needs to be more prominent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related? http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1719/about-page-site-tour-still-refers-to-faq-and-not-the-help-centerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No. One's about links that say they're to the (now defunct) FAQ.

Ergo the FAQ is gone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Right. What I was trying to say is that Mike's bug report was that links to the Help Center are still tagged as FAQ. My point is that the Help Center itself should have the on/off topic page more prominent. They're related in that they both are about the Help Center but they aren't the same bug report.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ahh.

Going https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicfrom our old FAQ, I'd also like to see:


Pre-release, non-publicly available beta software and software granted only under an NDA


This one gets a fair bit of heavy use in the time periods in which Apple has pre-announced an operating system but not yet released it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I had a chat discussion that we might get two / three reasons at most. Perhaps we should split these out so that we can see which are most needed and which will lack a custom close reason and have to fall under the generic. I admit I'm not 100% sure how this is supposed to work - see this post for details. http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184637/what-do-elected-site-moderators-need-to-do-to-support-the-new-custom-question-cl


















We have a question that might help illustrate the line we draw on programming questions:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94308/symbol-present-in-mach-kernel-but-not-in-any-kpihttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94308/symbol-present-in-mach-kernel-but-not-in-any-kpi


It was closed for being off-topic, and I understand much of the setup is relating to potential or exclusive developer turf, but the actual question as I see it is about parsing kext and things that kernel hackers and admin/users familiar with unix will know is simply hardware details of the OS.

Let's go over the plusses and minuses of this specific question as well as document were the line on "programming" might be drawn.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should a question about parsing kext be closed as off topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Somewhat related: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1642/xcode-questions


















Questions about "programming" or "development" are typically tricky, because there are a lot of borderline cases and we don't have enough questions on the site yet to show consistency. My key guideline when moderating these kind of questions is


Keep open if it is

focused on tool issues (e.g. usage or problems with XCode or accessing Apple's developer documentation
primarily concerned with using homebrew, macports and friends to install software from source

Close it if

Objective C code (or compilable code in general) is required in the question or the answer
a design or framework issue is raised (e.g. how do I update the Notification Center from my application)



What triggered me to close the question which led us to this thread here was primarily the context of "I'm developing something and run into some linking issues due to missing symbol". My kernel hacking days are long over (and it wasn't OS X either) but I doubt whether a non-programmer does have the faintest clue what this all is about. And even an administrator (who might run into issues with missing symbols while compiling/installing 3rd party software) probably doesn't need kernel symbols (or will get back to the software provider/developer for help). 

Having said that, the question probably could be rewritten into a more generic form of "How do I find the library a missing symbol is in" or similar. But given the very specific nature of the issue at hand, any solution to that problem might not answer the original issue at all.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree entirely with your framework, but I'd go on to say that if a question is cast as aimed at a developer issue but it's obvious how a non-developer could use the same information, great. If that's not so obvious, the question should be closed, but reopened if it can be edited to include non-developer use cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Patrix - you were totally right here and I was wrong. I wanted to make it work, but it needs a big edit to save it as opposed to being even somewhat on topic as it stands today. Thanks for working it out here.


















Part of the new close process is to remove the Too Localized reason to close. The reasoning is given on https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/185102/responding-to-your-too-localized-concernsmeta stackexchange. The main reason is it is being misused on SO and a few other sites.

The question is what do we need to do on Ask Different, ask for TL to be kept or add more Off Topic reasons or what.....

I did a query for questions that we have closed as Too localised http://data.stackexchange.com/apple/query/120985/too-localisedhere

I think we have misuse of TL there are several that should be closed for non constructive or even left open but then we get ones that I think are of no use to anyone else

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13127/imac-10-1-2-reinstalled-over-10-1-5-now-not-workingInstall 10.1.5 Just too old

Some iDisk questions that are now obselete as the service is gone - note that SO would not have this problem as old versions of code and compilers will be around and so a useful answer could be given

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8729/new-digitizer-stopped-working-after-30-secondsHardware related just a specific case and we can't do more. 

We also have momentary errors where a web site is down.

Also cases were OP then comments or edits saying the problem has disappeared.

Cases where an install has failed and shows the logs - SO has a close reason for just "Programming, but not Code dumps." do we need something similar

I would like to ask a question on the main site regarding implementing/using Apple Script:

I have noticed many answers to questions here at Ask Different, give an alternative method to solving a problem, which appears (in my eyes at least), to be less straightforward, than a simple keyboard shortcut, third party app usage, system preference change etc... Many of those answers involving something called Apple Script.

Eg https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94548/how-to-close-all-finder-inspector-windowsHow to Close All Finder Inspector Windows

In this particular question one answer gives a simple keyboard shortcut to solve the problem, whilst another persons answer uses the "more complicated" Apple Script.

For some actions, a keyboard shortcut exists. For most things, it doesn't. For information about what AppleScript is and how to use it, go to http://developer.apple.com/applescript/ . To implement a particular change using AppleScript, that question would likely be in order on the main site, but you have to state what you're trying to do. In the question you linked to, the keyboard shortcut answer didn't solve the original problem, but the AppleScript did.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson Generally speaking when Apple Script is involved in a solution, are there alternatives methods (if you understand what i'm saying)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I still don't understand what you're asking. Are you asking to help understand AppleScript? Are you asking why answers use AppleScript? Are you suggesting we shouldn't allow answers using AppleScript?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson Yes understand AppleScript, and how to use AppleScript to implement or use as the solution (as and when required)


















The answer is more hidden than it should be. You aren't being bone-headed.

They're called comments. Once you earn https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment50 reputation points you gain the ability to write them.

You can't find the link to do it yet because you haven't accumulated sufficient reputation points on this site, but once you do, you'll find them much less confusing!

Since we're on meta, let's discuss how you might ask a question like:

Q What exactly is Apple Script ?

How do I implement the necessary change using Apple Script in order for the desired outcome to be achieved ?

On the main site. Ideally, you would follow our guide on asking a good subjective question. Focus on the specifics of solving one particular question realizing that asking people how to learn a vague topic is almost always a good reason to close a question for improvement.

So - I would say you have to do some homework to nail down what "the necessary change is" and be very brief and clear about "the desired outcome" so that you can know if 

a) an expert has any chance of knowing what problem you are facing and 

b) it's not simply a plea for knowledge and free training (or worse, getting someone else to do your work for you).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good.......


















Here are my 2 cents on this:

Philosophically, all moderators generally shouldn't unilaterally close a question with a single vote if we are not 100% sure (or maybe 88% sure) that it's off-topic or the question already has issues with confusion, divisiveness, or is actively harming the site.

I try not to assume something is unsaveable, unanswerable or off topic when I'm in the review queue or not reacting to a specific flag.

Now, if 4 site members had voted to close a question the presumption of it being truly off-topic is more likely and I would want to be able to make an edit or point out a clear flaw in the close reason before unilaterally re-opening it.

Now - as for this question in specific. Yes, there is clear mention in the setup that a developer happens to be the user, but in the specifics no code (Objective C, Xcode compiling or API) are actually involved in the topic. It is pure terminal commands that are accessible to each and every Mac that ships. You don't need to be a developer to answer the question, you don't need to install Xcode, you don't need anything except for knowing that terminal exists and that Apple's OS exposes hardware details to shell scripters and that the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nm_%28Unix%29GNU tool nm lets you map the details of a file.  

So, if we are to allow questions about "homebrew", "gcc", and other open source tools that rely only on the terminal - it seems odd to throw out this question that uses open source tools to look at Apple's hardware. Similarly, you can use command line tools to check GateKeeper status, code signing status, whether the network connection is wireless, ethernet or something else and I see this question as fundamentally about how someone can know what hardware is installed by using OS X to get at hardware details.

I happened to know all this, so I was able to flag this question for re-opening, but I wanted a meta thread to explain the difference between closing something that we knew as asked was off-topic versus something that might get edited or answered in an off-topic manner.

Despite all that, this question doesn't have enough details to make it "system-admin friendly" in that the specific problem isn't with loading or unloading a kext but with finding an API that's declared in the kernel (totally fine for this site) and looking for the development portal to access that undocumented internal API. (totally not fine for here)

I'll close this again which is what the first moderator did unless it gets edited to be more on-topic for admins as opposed to developers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see a problem with promptly closing a post and inviting edits to make it on-topic. If a post doesn't seem to have a use case for non-developers, closing it and inviting the OP to explain what problem the question would help answer that isn't a problem unique to developers seems no different than closing a question because it's unclear and inviting edits to make it clearer.


















Another aspect to consider is whether accepting hackintosh questions helps improve the quality of Ask Different.

Most of the questions I've seen so far fall into the category "I own XYZ. Haven't tried anything yet but do you think I can install OS X? Where should I start?".

In general, answers are (necessarily) vague and usually link to other sites. They hardly ever offer first-hand experience and the OP would get similar results by searching Google in the first place. 

Of course, you may argue that questions that stubbornly show poor research should be downvoted and eventually closed, regardless of the subject.

Possibly, but as I say, I notice a pattern here and wonder if it's in the interest of Ask Different to allow a topic where the usual interaction is that other users google on behalf of the OP and copy/paste the search result. 

Is this enough a reason to ban hackintosh from Ask Different? Probably not. But after adding the legal aspect to the equation I think the scales tip against hackintosh.

As for bmike's suggestion to tolerate it as a topic and let moderators accept good technical questions: I believe the moderators' decision will be certainly well-thought-out, but wouldn't the outcome, from the OP's point of view, be unpredictable and seem arbitrary? Wouldn't it be better to have a clear rule (either for or against it)?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps the bright line test should default against Hackintosh questions. A good technical question can likely be generalized in such a way that it is of use to more than just Hackintosh owners, and thus on-topic. Also note that modifying Apple hardware (and thus addressing driver issues, etc) *is* on-topic here, so many Hackintosh questions, if asked creatively, could become within the scope of the site. Thus, the "Make Mac OS X work on my hardware!" demands get closed, but a creative asker might be able to get their question answered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is my biggest concern about adding a hackintosh to the white list. Although the close reasons are changing, the original stack exchange idea of avoiding "too localized" and "shopping" in general and I would quickly reverse my support of this category if we saw overwhelming bad questions that somehow were still literally "on topic".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How does [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/105195/no-internal-display-but-external-hdmi-working-on-hackint0shed-sony-vaio-laptop) seem to others? Detailed enough or something to close?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very detailed indeed. It is a driver issue with non-supported hardware, but in this case it seems to be an *almost-supported* graphics chip. It could turn out being interesting if answers focus on explaining how to debug driver issues or tweak `kext`'s instead of the obvious "take a look at `/var/log/system.log`" etc. I'd give it a chance -- I see it has been put on hold, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i'm not so worried about legal concerns... but it will destroy the group's focus by adding another layer for EVERY problem or question.  not only is it about apple, or apps or all the other problems which keep this place busy,  but now to add another dimension to the array of problems/ complications seems counterproductive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When searching for the meaning behind a low level error code or verbose mode boot problem you inevitably end up finding 4 or 5 hackintosh forum threads. These threads almost always end in "try this BIOS instead" "great thanks that fixed it" rather than any discussion as to what the error means or how to properly address it. More noise is unnecessary.


















Quick answer I know, but my vote says no.

Hackintosh specific questions are largely user/hardware/software specific. In my opinion, they won't add too much value to the site, they will just be clutter. While it is possible to answer such questions, they aren't going to add a whole lot of long-lasting value.

On the flip side, we will also get huge questions like "How do I build a Hackintosh?", which really can't be answered well in the Q&A format of Ask Different.

Second, the legality of Hackintoshes is still largely debatable.

I say no. Leave the Hackintosh questions to http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/other http://www.tonymacx86.com/forum.phpestablished http://modmyi.com/forums/os-x-86/forums or http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/create?category=technologycreate an Area51 proposal.

With the points mentioned here, I'm no longer inclined to edit things. The current discussion seems heavily in favor of keeping the wording as is.

On the new /help page, we've added a big featured link to the "What topics can I ask about here?" page. This should help new users who are just browsing to be directed to one of the most important pages.



If any established user is looking to provide new users with a place to get an overview of the most important parts of the SE model, I recommend linking them to /about rather than /help. Even though the format is very different, it actually achieves what the old FAQ tried to do (i.e., provide an overview of the basic mechanics and rules of the site). 

If, on the other hand, you're trying to address a specific issue, link to the specific page in /help that covers that issue. (I'm still working on the last few articles to publish there, but if you feel there's an important topic that's not covered in the help center, please post here about it.)

I know that https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2/can-one-ask-hackintosh-questions-on-ask-differentHackintosh questions aren't accepted on apple SE or superuser anymore, but i really need an answer so i'm asking on meta.

I don't have vote to close privileges here, but wanted to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/96882/which-website-provide-ios-games-download-statisticsflag this question as off topic. Simply because it's not in the scope of this site, and just asking for an external website.
However, the three off topic options I have are:


Questions about software development are off-topic here, but can be asked on Stack Overflow.

Questions about pre-release software are off-topic. For more information, see Can we ask about iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks? and Can I ask about not-yet-publicly released OS?.

This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network



Neither of these applies, and unfortunately I can't add any custom close reason as well. The only option I have now is to use a custom moderator flag, but as of late, closure flags are not shown to moderators and go straight to the review queue—but when using a custom flag I'd overrule this and cause additional workload for mods, while the community could handle this itself.
Would a more generic off-topic close reason make sense?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we need a generic off-topic close reason?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5see http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1753/how-to-flag-this-type-of-question for a possible answerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess it boils down to whether moderators want to see custom flags being "abused" for what should be a close vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Flagging for attention" is ok for me, it's primarily saying "Hey moderator, have a look at that question".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Our flag volume makes using other a fair workaround, but it's not a "clean solution" as you point out. Tis must be a systematic issue since why make easpch site have a generic close reason. I'll look on the main meta for a relevant thread in a bit....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since the link is now dead it is quite ironic that the discussion on this question will never get an answer. The description given is just too vague and: "We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed." should also apply to questions. Especially when internal links might disappear. Like the one above.


















The moderation tools are really the review queue - except you have single action in some cases rather than needing collaborating votes to take action.

I have 10k on StackOverflow and my toolbar looks like yours when there are no items needing moderation / review. When the edit queue goes to 0 its number disappears, and the same with the flag queue.



Based on your screenshot, I suspect that Ask Different's 10k people keep up with the requests (and continue to do so when you look), so the 10k tool queue is empty.

Till last week, I reviewed both first-post and late-answers. today, I can't. It says that the users with 500 reputation can only review.

When did this happen?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why did the minimum reputation for review first-posts got changed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I saw this change too and the change must've been implemented this weekend as I was able to review friday.


















I wanted to flag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97699/can-i-travel-to-tibet-independentlyhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97699/can-i-travel-to-tibet-independently as off-topic (the question is now deleted), but differently from where I can vote to close a question as off-topic, I cannot select a custom reason. The reasons I could select are not the reason to close the question as off-topic.

Questions about software development are off-topic here, but can be asked on Stack Overflow. It's not about software development.
Questions about pre-release software are off-topic. For more information, see Can we ask about iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks? and Can I ask about not-yet-publicly released OS?. It's not even about pre-releases.

I flagged the question for moderation attention, but it doesn't seem right.
I know that flagging the question as off-topic causes the question to be added to the review queue, where other users would be able to vote to close it.
Should I simply leave the task to the users with the privilege of close-voting questions?
In this case, I had another reason to flag the question, since it contained a not necessary link that made it smell like spam. I am asking what I should do for a question I think it should be closed, now that the off-topic close-reason has sub-reasons.

For most practical purposes the flag reason doesn't matter that much, all flagged posts end up in the same moderator queue at the end. So in any case choosing a flag for dubious posts is better than not flagging it at all.

This question is related to: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1698How do I link to a specific answer?.

Within the set of answers (to a specific question) I may represent like this:


Question 59917

Answer   59918

Answer   87982



I want to use a link toward answer n°3 (which is technically the one which I'd like to refer to because of its technical level).

This function exists, but differential tests (with other Stack Exchange groups and with other browsers) show that there is a relationnal problem between Firefox and Stack Exchange Ask Differnet group. 

Look at this particular answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87982https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87982
as an example of what I'd like to be able to use.
Within Firefox I'm getting tohttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/59918https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/59918.

I investigate this and will update or delete my question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This behaviour can be reproduced: Firefox goes on the wrong answer, where Safari is going correctly to the wanted one.

I'll post specific examples in an answer below.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Could we re-title & update the question to reflect that this is now about the bug? I can't edit the question.

In this particular case, I would have used:

I can only flag those questions, since I cannot vote to close them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this case, the method you used seems the right one, and better than nothing (Patrix ®).


















This looks like a bug between the Javascript in use on StackExchange and
Firefox (22.0). When I write:

http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87982


within a new Firefox window I see it is immediatly rewritten as:

http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59917/how-do-you-get-system-diagnostic-files-from-os-x/87982#87982


And the debugger of Firefox tells me that there are some CSS and Javascript error after this single GET:

Lets deal with the downvote issue first. One downvote is one person somewhere on the Internet didn't like what you wrote. It can hurt, but when you realize that posts sit up for years, there will be lots of time for others to appreciate what you wrote. Now 3 to 5 downvotes and it might be you that needs to change something....

As for the edits, that's what rollbacks are here for: to undo changes coming from misunderstandings, misinterpretations or plainly wrong edits. 

Thanks for raising the issue here on meta. Trying to ask why downvotes happen on the main site works quite poorly in practice.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey again @patrix, yes thats correct but the behaviour and downvoting is really really annoying:(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand your problem and it deserves a longer answer. But I'm at work the whole day (same timezone as you are probably) so it has to wait for tonight. Maybe somebody else will throw in some thoughs as well in the meantime.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nah it's OK, since the computer is at home to it can wait :) Thank you!


















In general @patrix answer is correct, however in this case the original question really emphasised and was built round the game issue and thus was the part of the question that was to be answered so that I can see why the answer was given and the rollback of the question as you radically changed the question, and we see misediting occur so it was a reasonable assumption that the original game point was correct,

However as you were the original asker it makes sense for you to restate the issue and so rollback even though it invalidated the answer.

I think this is just one of these things that happens and not much can be done as I don't think anyone took a definitely wrong action. The question now explains your problem better as as removed the red herring and so we can consider this afresh.

What purpose does the Tumbleweed badge serve apart from annoying me? And now I'm getting this: This question body does not meet our quality standards. Please make sure that it completely describes your problem - including what you have already tried - and is written using proper grammar.

They're supposed to be fun, non-serious and don't represent anything really. I'd suggest shrugging it off. If it really bothers you, you can delete the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC., I asked a question about something that has been a serious problem on my computer (for a long time now), and I was hoping for a helpful answer - all I got was an irritating and useless badge!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It certainly could seem like just rubbing it in that you didn't get any help. This is worth noting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson, Thanks, I've been checking every day hoping to get a response, and I notice there are a lot of questions being asked with very few views, and hardly any answers - it seemed like a waste of time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SteveW recall that we're not paid in any way to answer questions here. People do it because they find enjoyment in it and part of that enjoyment is the badges. I understand you're trying to find an answer to a serious question, but part of what keeps people engaged here and helping people is a little bit of levity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC.I fully understand that no one gets paid for this, but the very existence of the site suggests that you might get lucky and find someone who can answer your question - therefore raising your hopes. The badge I received raised my hopes even more.. and then I read what the badge was for. It was like a slap in the face accompanied with group laughter! I hope you can understand how disappointing and irritating that was.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd hoped we might find an answer for you. I hope the Apple tech gets your computer working!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson, Aw, I lost my Tumbleweed badge!  :) Thanks Daniel for all your help, and I hope IanC has managed to cool down a bit. My 'Help' issue hasn't been resolved yet, the tech at Apple thinks it could be a port problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You get to keep the tumbleweed badge :-)


















One "point" to the Tumbleweed badge is that it makes it more likely that someone might find your question. If any users are looking to be helpful on questions that others have passed on, they can watch https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/badges/21/tumbleweedthe tumbleweed page for posts that haven't gotten the attention they deserve.

The system gives the Tumbleweed designation to posts that have flown under the radar. That can help them get noticed.

I'm using Firefox 22.0 on my Mac and I can confirm this defect. It's also an issue with Firefox on Windows.  FWIW, I've also seen this behavior with previous versions of the browser.

And yet: I've only witnessed this defect at Ask Different.  I'm a moderator at the Personal Finance & Money Stack Exchange and spend enough time there and I've never seen this happen at Money.

Consequently, I suspect the issue is related to a difference between how Ask Different has been configured/customized vs. how other Stack Exchange sites behave – or at least, vs. those SE sites that remain plain beta-themed, like Money is, currently.

For instance, on Ask Different, the following link is supposed to jump directly to the anchor for Jeremy Mullin's answer at the corresponding question:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/11105https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/11105

... But it jumps to the top answer, not the one whose id is in the link. See:



(Note that if you scroll down fast enough, you'll at least see Jeremy Mullin's answer flash, like it is supposed to.)


Whereas, at Personal Finance & Money, the following link is supposed to — and does — jump directly to the anchor for fennec's answer:


https://money.stackexchange.com/a/2772https://money.stackexchange.com/a/2772

... It jumps to the expected answer, being the one whose id is in the link. See:




@patrix had commented on this meta question: "I'll tag it as a bug but I wouldn't bet on it getting resolved."  Actually, I hope the difference I've demonstrated above shows this bug has a solution in reach? e.g. Isolate & test the differences between the Ask Different theme and the plain Stack Exchange beta theme.  Create a sandbox instance of Ask Different, and remove/revert-to-plain the customized JS, CSS, and other parts, one at a time, until the issue goes away, identifying the errant part. Then, determine the appropriate fix for that errant part. 

Alternatively, perhaps the errant customized part can already be inferred from the debugging information presented in the other answer? Such might be obvious to the developer who did the customization work for Ask Different in the first place.

When I click the link in your comment (which is supposed to go to *this* answer of mine), I actually see Daniel's answer at the top of the screen instead, though I can see a small portion of my answer flash at the bottom. Of course, which answer **you** see at top of the screen will depend on how you have answers sorted: *active*, *oldest*, or *votes*. I'm sorting by **votes** and so Daniel's answer (currently 1 vote to my answer's 0) is listed first. If you're sorting otherwise, it's a coincidence that hides the defect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(and if my answer should become the top-voted answer in this meta question, then your link will coincidentally start to work for me, too, while I remain sorted by *votes*.)


















There are dozens of questions on here that have viable answers, yet the asker never bothers to go back and assign an answer to the question. Many of them are quite obvious. Yet, as far as I can tell, there is no mechanism to assign an answer unless the assigner is the one who asked the original question. Is there a way to have a moderator or other designee answer a question that has an obvious answer, where the originator simply has not bothered to assign an answer?

I only participate on Ask Different, so this was the logical place for me to put it. Thanks for letting me know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's totally fine to ask site wide feature requests here. Developers do look on all meta for bugs and features. However, when a feature request gains traction on the main meta site - it's far more likely to get implemented.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd actually like to see this feature myself; I just wanted you to know that this battle has been fought, and decisively lost, several times before.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've seen the arguments against it (that it is too arbitrary; that people would get angry when their answer wasn't the accepted one), but personally, a group of moderators should plausibly be able to decide whether or not an answer should be accepted. As I've combed over this site for the last few weeks, I have found numerous questions that are in this condition. Also, as a participant, it wastes my time when I go to answer a question that has an answer, but it simply wasn't accepted by the OP. Anyway, that's just my rant for the day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, if you know what you're getting into, we'll re-open this and see if it goes anywhere.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dave - do post links to questions where you found an answer and went to answer it and let's see if there is consensus or something we can do in the current framework.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18312/moderators-accepting-answers-on-users-behalf-after-a-certain-time-period and http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100763/forcing-acceptance et alb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One issue is that moderation is not meant to deal with the knowledge os the question/answer this definitely applies to SO but here we might have more coverage of detailed knowledgeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And raised again http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/194561/could-high-ranking-users-mark-answers-for-other-questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi @DanielLawson, Just a quick administrative note — There's no need to redirect feature requests like this. We no longer try to divide support between "Ask Differnt questions" and "network-wide questions." This is the AskDifferent support site, and we don't expect users to understand (nor care) about the nuance of what meta SO is versus this site. On a rare, rare occasion a particularly intriguing question might truly benefit from the larger exposure of the network community, but routine stuff like this should just live wherever they are asked. Thanks.


















In this case - false information trumps the general prohibition to make a trivial edit. Sadly, the system won't even let us fix that one typo so we have to change more or use two edits to effect a one character change.

I wouldn't roll back, but just edit it correct going forward. 

Great catch. 

btw - that bmike fellow often is on an iPad and making silly typos when trying to improve a suggested edit

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/100258/is-it-possible-to-use-desktop-mac-apps-on-an-ipad/100261#100261Is It Possible To Use Desktop Mac Apps On An iPad?

Obviously you cannot tick all as correct, so what is the view to adopt in regards to selecting one answer?

Rather than make a long comment thread, I'll try to answer and clarify my thoughts...


















Pick the one you find most helpful. You can vote for multiple answers, but only one can get the checkmark. If you really want to reward a particularly great answer, you could start a bounty.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes but, with regards to the link in the comment I made above, I find both mine & Dave's answer to be helpful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If one answer is your own, the system provides incentives that might encourage one to accept the answer that is now one's own: accepting your own answer generates no reputation, but accepting someone else's gives you 2 points and the other person 15.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was thinking about accepting the other person's answer, as my recommendation has only just launched (so is not proven as such).


















That's one of the problems with software-recommendation questions. Several good answers might come back over time and you only can accept one of them. Now there are several things to note:


It's not mandatory to accept any answer at all. So you can just upvote the recommendations you liked and go on with your life
If you are going to accept an answer, it would probably best to accept the one you followed up on at the end (e.g. by installing/using the recommended software).

My experience is when it's hard to select an answer, that's a sign that the question itself needs improvement. Now, not all questions need to be improved - that one you linked to could easily have a check mark awarded, some up votes awarded and then after you've digested the options, come back and ask a knock-out, awesome, good-subjective question explaining how exactly to get one app to work well from Mac to iPad.

The rest of this answer is more for looking forward and general ideas on how to decide how to answer, but I'll also relate it to the question at hand.

First, Let's look at the guidelines on asking:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask

The question that was linked failed to do three things:


Show the research that was done to try and solve the question.
Provide context
Lacks any way to judge which answer is the best answer


The guidelines on what not to ask help with the last criteria:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask

Since the question seems more about discussion a general theme than asking for an expert to explain one specific thing it's turning into a poll of options as opposed to a plan to address a documented need.

Since those two links above are very dry, condensed and - dare I say - a bit lacking in specificity, here is a story explaining how these rules came to be.

http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/

I have looked back over the https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/100577/revisionsrevision history to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/100577/imessage-sign-in-not-working-correctly-after-changing-apple-idthis question and I am confused as to what actually happened.

I posted my suggested edit shortly after the question was posted initially (around 15 minutes after posting), yet my edit is not correctly listed and https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/36761was reverted since it seemed to 'mess up' a later suggested edit.



For example, it shows that my suggested edit removed the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/imessageimessage tag, yet this tag did not exist when I submitted my suggested edit.

The revision history shows that https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/54484/tubedogg@tubedogg submitted his edit 2 hours after the original post, considerably later than mine, yet mine also shows 2 hours, and being after his…

What's happened, and why did Community not reject one of the edits?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Suggested edit confusionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm, I remember approving the first two edits close after each other which is kind of strange since the system shouldn't let you edit a post where a suggested edit is still pending approval


















Reading the logs as closely as I can, it would appear that two suggested edits were allowed to be submitted to the same question, which the system ordinarily does not permit. Both were approved, but the second edit was applied on top of the first, which made less sense. As far as I can tell, this is a bug.

The one thing I about this that does make sense to me is that the time posted on suggested edits is the time at which they were approved, not the time at which they were submitted. So 2 hours after the original post is when both of your edits were approved, not when they were submitted.

Community◆ would not ordinarily reject an edit for that reason; instead, the ability to suggest an edit would be blocked if another suggested edit was pending.

Our help section has a prohibition on "hackintosh" questions where I believe the intent is to avoid low value, low quality questions about driver support.

  Installing or using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware (and most other explicitly unlicensed use of product)


Would it be helpful to explicitly mention virtualization as either on-topic or off-topic or just leave things as stated - focus on the hardware and close topics that aren't about virtualizing directly onto Mac hardware per the strict reading of the current help section?

Here are a few questions we've had under this category:

That would certainly be one good way to go about it, and honestly the method most likely to get you a useful answer. In your question, be sure to acknowledge the existence of the other question and to explain how your situation is different (that question specifies that it is for 10.7.4; the answers there do not help you) so that your question does not get closed as a duplicate. If your question does get closed as a duplicate, please do not get discouraged; we can re-open it, because it is not, in fact, a duplicate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll second Daniel's advice here. Taking an old, well answered question and trying to adapt it with a comment or a bounty to get a new answer is one option, but I would ask a new question, showing your research and explaining why the answers there do not work on 10.8.4


















As far as I can read the Apple License (and I am not a lawyer), installing Apple operating systems in a virtualized environment is permitted by the terms of the license as long as the virtualized environment is running on Apple-branded hardware. Running a virtualized system on non-Apple hardware is "explicitly unlicensed use of product".

If we want to keep that as our bright line test (and I'm indifferent to that as a standard, but it is our current one), then I'd say questions about installing OS X in a virtualized environment in general are on-topic here, because they could apply to a licensed use of OS X. If one can run Linux on a Mac (and a quick Google search indicates that this seems to be possible), then running OS X virtualized on a Mac that is running Linux would be a licensed use of the product, and thus on-topic for the site.

Questions specific to running OS X virtualized on Linux on, say, a Dell or a Wang or ENIAC would be off-topic because they explicitly violate the license agreement.

So my reading of the current standards is that because one could run Linux on a Mac and then legitimately virtualize OS X on top of that, the question is on-topic and needs no update to the FAQ.

Going through your examples,
the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/100726/playing-videos-on-virtualbox-macos-x-guest-on-ubuntu-13-04-as-hostfirst one is on-topic as is; Ubuntu can run on a Mac, so an end user entirely within the scope of Apple's license could be helped by this answer.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99433/moving-fusion-vms-to-esxisecond one is explicitly run on a Mac. The Apple terms say the software is licensed to run on Apple hardware, and that's what's being done.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/86304/can-mountain-lion-os-x-run-on-hp-g62-series-using-vmware-virtualizationthird one is off-topic; it's asking specifically about getting it to run on a HP computer. It might be editable to be on-topic, but if the problem is specific to the drivers needed for the HP hardware, it's off-topic.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51846/how-to-get-mac-os-x-to-run-in-a-vm-on-windowsfourth one is on-topic. Windows can run on a Mac, so this answer could apply to someone running Mac OS X on Apple hardware.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29065/installing-ios-on-vmware-workstationfifth one is leaning toward off-topic as written, but edit "I have a Windows PC" to "I have a computer running Windows" and we're back in on-topic territory.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20965/does-apples-license-for-os-x-allow-it-to-be-virtualized-on-an-hp-pcsixth one is clearly on-topic; it's asking what the license allows, rather than asking how to do something not permitted.

That said, I'd be fine with another standard, too; this was just my attempt to interpret our existing standards. I have no strong feelings here; just trying to be consistent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I could imagine a Mac hardware user running Linux as primary OS but wanting to virtualize OS X for the odd occasion when they need it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect. I'm more looking to be sure I understand consensus than change anything. My gut tells me we don't really need to close any of the example questions, but I didn't want to miss a good reason to close things down (or over-rule community votes should one of the ones that seemed good to me got closed).


















Well, we should have a chat room event for a start, a place to hang out and share useful livestreams and other info etc, maybe open it early and let people rip with the rumours in a controlled space ;)

Can't harm to throw a tweet to the chat event out to them.  Anyone got the chops for that?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we need to email the team@stackexchange.com asking them to poke the people that handle the twitter account to tweet things manually.


















If I slowly mouseover the comments button on AD (I have tried with with 2 other SE sites that I cannot replicate this on) I get a rapid flickering between the hover and non hover state when I near the edge of the button, that stops when I go to the center of the button (or move away).

It looks like the button size for the "on hover" css is a couple of pixels smaller than the normal state.  This means that if you touch the very bottom of the button in the normal state, then the on-hover triggers and the button is highlighted, but without moving the cursor is now seems outside the 'on hover' detection edge, and reverts back to the normal view, and repeats on/off until I move the mouse.

This seems to happen on the bottom and right edges, but not the top or left.



I made this video to make it clearer http://cl.ly/RHi6http://cl.ly/RHi6 

This happens on (Windows) Chrome 29.blah for me, but not on IE8 which renders the button differently (no rounded corners) although it does move everything below the button up a few pixels when highlighted.  Not on a Mac presently to test in OS X.

We wanted to let you know that we are currently testing some new ads on the mobile version of Ask Different. They are shown in two places right now: the bottom of the home page, and the question page (between the first and second answers, as on Stack Overflow). Right now you'll only see them if:


You're viewing the mobile version of the web site
You're on an iOS device
You have less than 200 rep (i.e. don't have the https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/reduced-adsreduced ads privilege).


This is only a test, and we're interested in your feedback. Obviously, nobody loves ads, but we're hoping these are unobtrusive enough (especially for high-rep users, who will see less of them) and at least somewhat interesting to justify their existence. Stack Exchange will always remain free, so we have to experiment with some small ways to pay for the sites' upkeep. 

If we don't see good enough results from these ads, we'll shut them off in a few weeks.

I was editing a question and tried to add a "iphone-5s" tag and AD won't let me do it. I have the rep to create new tags, but I guess not if it is too similar to an existing tag.

I was trying to update this question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/101532What's the difference between the battery of iPhone 5s vs iPhone 5?

Also, a tag for iPhone-5c will probably be necessary shortly.

Is there a way to create these tags, or do I need to ask the moderators nicely?

Don't know why couldn't create the tag but I made it for you, tagged that question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-5s You shouldn't have to ask mods, nicely or otherwise, do to create tags at your rep.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Overzealous typo prevention, I imagine. That or a check for unnecessary pluralization. (iPhone-5 -> iPhone-5s, keyboard -> keyboards)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I put in a feature request to fix this in the general case: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1816/plural-guard-registering-false-positives-on-this-site


















We've established the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-5siphone-5s and a synonym to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone5siphone5s as well as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-5ciphone-5c and its synonym.

Let's use this post to discuss the pros and cons of having separate tags (vs all using iPhone or all using iPhone 5 vs emacs vs vi et.cetera.)

For what it's worth, you ran into the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/187406/is-the-tag-pluralization-filter-working-correctlytag pluralization filter which was implemented to prevent https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6752/merge-singular-and-plural-tagsbigger messes like this from happening. I believe only site moderators and staff can establish tags that contravene that filter (in this case iPhone-5s was locked since we had a pre-existing tag of iPhone-5).

I see no special privilege that allows this, but we might be able to get one of out 10k users to test creating a tag that would normally be tripped up by the filter to know for sure.

That's what I was expecting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MarkThalman I'm not understanding what you'd like to have happen at this point. I thought you were asking for iPhone-5s and iPhone-5c tags to get created. We've got both now. Perhaps I confused the issue by dragging synonyms into the mix. I can edit that out of my answer if so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My initial problem is solved. Thank You. It seems like there should have been a way for me to solve this without switching to meta and asking the moderators for help. That doesn't seem to be keeping with the spirit of the StackExchange sites. If nothing can be done to change this in the future, that is fine. I was hoping when this got flagged as a bug that it would change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aah - I'll update this to mention the filter that you ran up against. It's by design and intentional as opposed to being a bug from what I've learned on the main meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I though it was obvious it was by design. I thought the design could use some improvement.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In general, when there's a tag "foo", we really don't also want a "foos" tag created. Apple *is* making that pattern not work so well now that they have three times added an S to a model name to indicated is successor. The problem is that this pattern seems to come up a fair bit on this particular site, but the filter is system-wide. I agree with you that this is not optimal, but I'm not sure if the coders who write this site will think it's worth changing the system coding for a tag that seems to be created once every two years.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now I understand better. I thought it was just a one character, and character, difference that was triggering the behavior, but it is specifically  plus 's' that is triggering it. This makes sense, and if the back end code is shared between all of the SO/SE sites, then Daniel is correct that this is an outlier, that only happens every two years, doesn't make sense to change for all sites running on this web engine. Thanks for all your help and understanding guys!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We couldn't help if you didn't ask :-) I appreciate the feedback and your action to make the site better.

Yes, a moderator removed the comment because it wasn't related to any question or answer particularly and was rather discussion about who might have downvoted an answer.  No-one, not even moderators, can see who voted for who (unless there is a pattern of vote abuse that is picked up by the system and alerted to us) and questioning a user on their voting isn't considered appropriate.

Unlike for questions, reasons are not stored for edits and deletion of comments so there is nothing to see.  As mentioned by @Mat, only moderators can see deleted comments.

I wanted to suggest that why ?they? downvoted the answer (If indeed was them, otherwise I would have then expected both our comments to be deleted) was stated, because I thought they may be suggesting that the date in the answer was wrong, but given the limited wording I wasn't sure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, before I write up a "Please consider (at least) giving authors access to their deleted comments" meta question, if for no other reason that people could go crazy wondering if their crazy ;) (But it is also nice to have something to show for sometimes some time typing, i.m.o) has it already been suggested?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know if it has been suggested, but if you do make a question I would so it on SO, not AD, as it's a site wide request that isn't particularly AD specific.  I can't comment on the thinking of the particular Mod who removed it, but even if the user *hadn't* downvoted, it's not fair to put other users on the spot - voting is totally anonymous by design - so it seemed a reasonable action to take.  Hope you understand our thinking.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5PS, you are welcome to add the comment back in, but word it differently and make it anonymous, not specific to a particular user.

It wouldn't be advisable to relax a basic sanity check that works the vast, vast majority of the time. Like you said, most of the time this is a very good thing.

On the rare occasion where a tag like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-5siphone-5s is needed, a moderator can create it. That's why we call them exception handlers. They can create tags like this.

The situation seems to arise once every two years; it's fairly predictable, but also, as you observe, rather rare.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't find our 10K users to be less sane than our moderators.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I had my way, the line between moderator and highly-experienced user would be rather blurry. But under our current structure, I think this rarely-needed ability falls nicely in the "exception handler" court... without unnecessarily over-complicating the understanding of who can do what.


















Please make sure to read prior discussion of this, especially https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/18318/160917https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/18318/160917.  Our moderators are impressively knowledgeable, but I don't think it would make sense to have them select which answers should be accepted.  One of the principles of this site is that the wisdom of the community is, in aggregate, far greater than the wisdom of any one person (even one of our esteemed moderators).  Therefore, it makes more sense to reserve moderators for process issues -- not to substitute their judgement on substantive issues for that of the community.

Would this be suitable as a question on Ask Different?

Using A Combination of Android & iOS Devices in Everyday Digital Life?

I have often heard the phrase, if you own an iOS device that is what you should stick to, in order to immerse yourself & harmonise your activities within Apple's ecosystem.

Similarly if you own an Android smartphone, you should own an Android tablet in order to immerse yourself & harmonise your activities within the Android/Google Ecosystem.

Whilst this makes perfect sense to me......

If one were to combine an iDevice, either iPhone or iPad with an Android device (either smartphone or tablet), and therefore immersing yourself in both worlds.

Is one giving oneself additional hassle in everyday life with such an arrangement (as opposed to just to sticking to one or the other) ?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How suitable is this example question for the main site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also - don't be too discouraged by down votes here on meta. They don't dock your reputation and indicate that others feel the proposal isn't appropriate for the main site (or up votes would indicate it's a good thing). The good thing is to ask and start a dialog +10 for thatb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Thats fine.

I often forget about the chat facility at SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Simon I think you could ask any number of valid questions pertaining to the topic on the site. The problem is with unanswerable *tell me everything* questions (or as I think of them, *essay questions*). Try making a list of your concerns for yourself, then post a question about one specific issue. It still might not fly, but I think there is value here — and potential blogpost fodder.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jaberg Thanks for that.

I just wanted to post this as a featured item to let everyone know that we have a lot more traffic than normal which means a lot of new users.

I want to thank everyone who is adding constructive comments and downvotes to the inevitable influx of poor quality posts.

I would encourage people to avoid using spam flags for posts that have zero constructive comments, zero down votes and are not actually commercial promotions or offensive speech.

Furthermore, we're declining more than the usual flags for the not an answer reason when the post is clearly an attempt to answer (it's not a me too, or an entirely new question) and it's in some way not the answer an expert might give or it even is a totally wrong answer.

Please try to be patient with new users. Assume they are here to learn and contrite and perhaps use the other flag to explain precisely what you feel is harmful to the site by leaving the post up. We can mark those flags as helpful much easier than if we ding a new account for spam just because they posted a wrong answer. Also, it saves the system from de-prioritizing your future flags since an accumulation of several declined flags puts your input at the bottom of the list.

The majority of the flags are awesome and the vast majority merited some flag - just that severe flags are being used for trivial posts that a simple edit or a helpful comment and some patience will clear up.

"New user" is often a costume.

We do sometimes let a single post remain for a while to give a user a chance to distinguish themselves from a spam bot account - but the down votes on those posts helps immensely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Heh.  I think you're technically right -- my rejected recent flags were my incorrect use of "not an answer."  Anyway, let's call a spam flag marked as helpful but ultimately ineffective (the answer living on) a "soft rejection" -- and I've seen a handful of *those* ;-)


















42

(unanswered questions get bumped back to the top later when we least expect it, so to prevent this from happening, I've posted an "answer" to this "question." The question is indeed a timely reminder and a useful use of the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/featuredfeatured tag. Besides, you can't go wrong with the answer 42.)

In reference to https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1824/site-traffic-new-users-an-influx-of-invalid-spam-flagsthis other meta question:


  I would encourage people to avoid using spam flags for posts that have
  zero constructive comments, zero down votes and are not actually
  commercial promotions or offensive speech.   [emphasis mine]


I expect those of us who use the flagging system work from a standpoint of "I'll know it when I see it" — but we don't all see things the same way in the face of ambiguity.

As a moderator elsewhere in the SE network, I've developed a somewhat low threshold for considering a post spam, and since I hang out here too I consider it my civic responsibility to put my nose to good use.  (Actually, I really just want a shiny https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/badges/73/marshalMarshal badge. :)

So, under my thinking:  If a new, mostly unidentified, unregistered, 1-rep user posts an answer to an old question, and the answer mentions/links to a commercial product or service, or a sketchy blog/article linking to such, my shit-detector goes off.

I ask myself: Why, out of the blue, did a completely new user come to the site and post a commercial link-containing answer to an old, already-answered question (i.e. quite often not a question on the home page) for a problem they aren't having?

The simple explanation is it's a spammer using a targeted search for places to astroturf.  Since most spam are one-offs, I often don't wait for a pattern to emerge.  This isn't a criminal court, and presumption of innocence isn't necessary. I work on the balance of the probabilities. Deleting a seemingly spammy post isn't the death sentence.

But that's me.  I've had some flags rejected.  Maybe I'm too quick to judge?

So:  What is (or should be) the objective criteria or definition here at Ask Different for considering something spam or commercial promotion?

If the current standard is tacit, can we work to write it down?  If there isn't such a standard, can we work to establish one?  What do you think of the criteria I mentioned above?  It's easy to recognize obvious spam ("Buy now! Operators are standing by!") and also spam where there's a clear pattern, but what about quick & subtle one-offs?

Thanks!

describes the way I look for spam myself  quite nicely. So if you follow that approach to flag stuff as spam (especially for answers around the usual suspects like video conversion and data recovery of any kind) you'll probably have a rather high approval rate. It may not be 100% though because a single message by a single user may or may not be considered as spam by the moderator handling the flag.

What's actually more an issue (and which the driver behind the question linked to) is that sometimes users tend to flag stuff they don't like or agree with (and at least partially use the "spam" option for whatever reason). We have taken up a more relaxed position here recently and are rejecting flags for things which are at least slightly on-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is how I see it as well. I'm not much concerned with how often it's posted. Once is enough for me if it smacks of that "I searched the web for places to promote my crummy iPhone data transfer software for Windoze and found Ask Different" type post.


















I'm mainly interested in avoiding false positives. If someone is legitimate new user to our site and wants to find question they can answer, one way to get a foot in the door might be to recommend a piece of software that solves someone's problem. Of course this is also the model for how a spammer would operate. My main concern is avoiding alienating new users who actually plan to contribute to the site while weeding out the spam.

If a user's first post is to recommend software that actually is relevant to solving someone else's problem, I'm inclined to give the user the benefit of the doubt. Now if the same piece of shady software keeps popping up in first-post recommendations, if the user only recommends software in answers and nothing else, or other conditions that I can't publicly disclose make it clear that the account is a spam account, fire away.

Spam is harmful primarily because of its volume (thus the term Spam, in reference to the http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5REMonty Python sketch). A single promotional post is either a helpful answer, in which case it will attract votes, or unhelpful, in which case it will languish without votes and be fairly innocuous. It's only when the posts become part of a larger pattern with volume that they become disruptive. So if a pattern emerges, we zap. In the meantime, we need not act too hastily unless the post is clearly promotional noise.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting reasoning.  *Scenario:* A potential "legitimate new user" (or, could be a spammer who scrubbed their cookies) posts one single answer containing a promotional link. Let's say the answer survived for a few months and the unregistered account that posted it never visited the site again. Is the risk of a false-positive alienation of a "new user" thereby reduced by the time that has passed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, at Money SE, the situation I dread as a moderator is a spammer posing as a "legitimate new user" in order to mention a product or service that could then be damaging to a real person's financial situation.  e.g. loans, debt consolidation services, trading scams, etc. Perhaps the stakes here aren't as high, although software can do some *nasty* things too.  I don't buy that leaving spam alone to languish at the bottom of the page means it won't potentially do harm. Savvy active users with rep know better and understand the votes, but the average anon user coming from search might not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisW.Rea I agree, but the trick is knowing the difference. If the software is one that we've seen a pattern of spam users promoting before, I'd delete the post. If the software is known legit software with no history of spam promotion, hold your fire. In between, I'd err on the side of wait and see, but if a pattern emerges of spam promotion of that software, I'd search and destroy all the spammy links to it. One-off links to software that Apple will list on the Mac App Store, though, seem not worth destroying on sight. I agree that the stakes here are real but not as high as on Money.SE.


















I'd be more okay with a more aggressive anti-spam approach if we had a help page about "My message got deleted as spam but I wasn't trying to post spam. What happened and what can I do?" that a user got a link to when their post was deleted as spam.

That page could describe that first posts that contain either promotion of less-known software or links to blogs promoting less-known software are considered suspect, but if the user wants to get involved in the site by answering other questions in ways that don't resemble guerrilla software promotion, their posts would be less likely to be taken down.

I would like to ask this question or similar on the main site:

Are there iOS apps which are specifically designed for iPhone or iPad only and cannot be used on both iDevices (with the exception of apps for making calls which I think are generally iPhone only - correct me if i'm wrong) eg http://discovr.info/Discovr for iPhone

The example above specifically says for iPhone, but I see no reason for it not to be used on an iPad (or is it just the marketing surrounding this particular app).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Suitability of Question Regarding iOS Apps?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not really sure what you are intending to ask, can you clarify?  Obviously an iPad only app can never run on an iPhone, are you asking if there are any iPhone apps that will not run on an iPad?  If so, what is the problem you are trying to solve by asking?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really appreciate your asking how to ask here. In this case - the best advice I can give is to focus on something you are trying to do. What will other people learn by your asking how apps are designed? This might be a better question for stack overflow - how to code things so that an app only runs on devices that have a telephone. Or here - how do I indicate an app should only run on certain hardware in iTunes Connect. Or - how to tell from the app store description if an app will work on an iPod touch. In all those cases - it's clear what you are actually trying to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Understand. I was under the impression that all iOS apps were created equal (thats obviously not the case). Don't really want to get too technical about it. I'll think up some suitable questions regarding it. If i'm making sense.


















As phrased, that strikes me as a poor question for the site. 

In your case - you are asking a yes/no question.

One answer will be yes - there are apps that only run on one device.

Another answer will be no - there is no way to target apps to run on only one device.

We even entertain wrong answers - so you might get both answers to the same question and have to suss out which makes more sense to you.



In this case, what next? What problem are you actually trying to solve. It seems you are falling into the XY problem trap and not describing what you really want to do.

We have a lot of images that due to retina display densities, appear huge when uploaded using the stock controls.



When I go in and add a height control before the src, the html isn't rendered on the site:





<img height="40" src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gU2OO.png" >

When you add the height tag after the src, it renders properly. Could the code be fixed so that valid img syntax works without needing to order the modifiers after the src attribute of the ing element doesn't have to come first in the post text?

I have provided an answer to https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/68738/24974"Why is my MacBook Pro stuck on mute?".


  This is simple, this is Apple fault. I'm using Ubuntu now on my
  macbook pro, it never suffers from the infamous headphone jack
  problem. Removing the headphones, the internal speakers work, plug it
  in, the headphone works.
  
  On OS X, it just doesn't work. If I dare plugging in the headphones, I
  know that when I take it out, internal speakers will stop working,
  they will be muted, and not come back after a while. I've stopped
  plugging stuff in and out trying to make it work.
  
  I just installed a new OS that works.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/9495/stuffestuffe moderator has just deleted the answer, and commented, "this is not an answer".

I really would like this undeleted. Because http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/continuing-issues-and-solutions-for-the-mbps-silent-speaker-problem/12865I've digged this problem so much, and when I installed Ubuntu, it just didn't exist.

Let's undelete it and make the answer you propose more clear. You'll want to add a link to your research as well as describe what version of Ubuntu works to avoid the issues you think are happening in this case for an ideal answer. We still might eventually decide to delete it, but let's see if it can be edited to a point where everyone sees it as a valid attempt to answer the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike ok for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, +10 for asking about clarification here and showing some research.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike as someone mentioned in the chat on apple.stack you are generous.


















Thanks for posting this up here - we always answer and would much rather have a civil discussion here rather than a to and fro in comments.

Here are my thoughts:

Your answer as originally posted could essentially be boiled down to "It's Apple's fault. The headphone socket does not work on OS X, use Ubuntu".  I could have used a couple of reasons for deletion such as "Not Constructive", or I could have added a formal post notice to it.  In my haste, I didn't explain it fully (for which I take one on the chin without prejudice) but believe me I feel confident that it would have been flagged by another user if I hadn't happened to see it first so soon after you posted it.

I think you will agree that in the form against which I moderated it, it was not really an acceptable answer, and more of a rant, unless you were genuinely of the opinion that telling the OP that it just doesn't work by design and to use a stop using OS X on an Apple Q&A site was being helpful.

While your edit is much less combative it's still saying more or less the same thing, and using some language that isn't necessarily required which adds a negative tone to the content; "If I dare plug in the headphones", why not simply state "When I plug in..."?

Even with further modification, I think there are still issues with the answer, namely:


Your own contribution is still "Doesn't work; Use Ubuntu", and the external links are simply links with no summary or overview
Your summary is incorrect, it's a hardware problem, and nothing to do with the OS.  Just because Ubuntu doesn't support the extra functions and defaults to normal headphone mode doesn't mean OS X is at fault.  Even the links you provide state for example:



  "Inside the jack is a very small switch that turns on and off the optical audio output while simultaneously disabling the internal speakers. The switch can be turned on by simply using headphones."


  It seems that when removing the headphones with a yank after editing some audio, I must have accidentally flicked a switch inside the port. The MacBook Pro thought that there was still a TOSLINK connector attached even though there wasn’t anything plugged into the port.




This sort of thing is common in a variety of devices that use headphone sockets.  Here is pretty much the same issue on someone's iPhone (Not directly caused by a toslink switch, but caused by a gummed up socket that has the same end result - the socket thinks something is using it): https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81879/apple-headphone-remote-doesnt-always-work/81889#81889Apple headphone remote doesn't always work (I would suggest trying the accepted answer and seeing if it helps if you still have an OS X install on the machine).

I hope this helps explain why I removed it.  I notice that it's been undeleted, and has since received an up vote; I won't perform any other moderation on it, as though while I feel it's borderline useful it's not actively poor any more, so it's now down to the community to accept or flag as appropriate.

Thanks for your time, and feel free to pop into chat or engage further in Meta.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I too scratched my head a bit. If the problem is a flakey or faulty hardware switch - what would make ubuntu better at overcoming that failure than OS X. I suppose they could code in some extra awesome driver mojo - but part of me suspects it's just in need of a cleaning or unsupporting the switch detection masks the hardware failure on another OS.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The fact that Ubuntu works is likely because it has no awareness of the *toslink* switch and as such the dual-use of the port, ergo regardless of if the tiny switch is stuck or not, it simply ignores it.  Not extra driver mojo, but *missing* driver mojo, as it were.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've changed the headline of my answer, since was @bmike who authored part of it. I do believe, if ubuntu can handle the hardware the way I want, why not OS X can do the same? That would fix it. About my tone I just used that language because it's exactly how I feel, and I wanted to pass it. **I almost never dare** plugging the headphones because I know the frustation that is gonna be afterwards.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I get you, and the post is back up, I'd just re-iterate that it's not that Ubuntu "can handle it", it's that it *ignores* it, precisely because it can't handle it - this is they key difference between OS X and Ubuntu in this instance; as Mike said, Ubuntu's failure to recognise the switch and it's usage is just masking the issue. You have a gummed up port, it happens, it's a hole that is open to the environment with about 5 switches inside it that are prone to being affected by dust and debris.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5About Ubuntu/Linux being able or not to handle both modes of audio output, I dunno, I just speculated that because I thought it were fair. But anyway, maybe there're ways for enabling it, who knows. This issue is common, looking around at the web, people just get annoyed by this. If it were easely solved by taking out dust _once_, ok, but it's not like that on a great amount of cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think your speculation can be confirmed, and the extra use can be added to Ubuntu with the correct hardware drivers, but in your case that would merely reintroduce the problem for you.  I know it's fairly common, for many devices not just MBPs, hence the link to the same issue on an iPhone above.  It is annoying, but for the majority of people I have helped with the issue, a 1 time clean generally solves the problem long term; I myself had the issue on my MBA, and only ever fixed it one time with no recurrences.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However even after considering this with the millions of these devices out there (and hundreds of millions for some devices) even a tiny percentage will still result in a *lot* of people who, by the very nature of their products, are likely to hit up the internet looking for a fix.  If this happens to 0.01% of Macbook owners, then that's potentially a whopping 400 from last quarter alone...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5can you realize the nature of the word _software_ here? if that's true, and ubuntu is working because it doesn't have any notion of the dual-mode of the output port, if it could get the dual-mode working by _additional software_, it doesn't necessarily means that it needs to be hardcoded, it could be optionally enabled, and that, would keep the issue away... that's what I ultimately meant by "why not OS X can do the same?" I restate, as in the article I refer, this is Apple fault, and has been for years. And the number of complains and articles around it doesn't seem to represent a minority...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I believe I am aware of software.  However all this could this and could that is not relevant to the question as asked.  You asked why it was removed, I explained.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even though you explain the deletion, you're right about the end result not differing much from the initial answer, and that's on purpose, that's what I meant as an option. Apple software doesn't provide an option for disabling detection of dual-mode, so, use a software were that's meaningless but works as expected. I provided a empirical, factual, answer, which was pretty helpful for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It just got _decorated with this and thats_ and got back online. There's no more improvement, it was an answer from beginning, and got removed because of such assumptions like: "it's incorrect, it's (solely) a hardware problem".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would accept your answer (this one) right away if you said the deletion was _because of_ such assumptions when you deleted the answer, and not stating them as definitely correct.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we are clear that your solution works for you, I still think it's a poor solution for someone asking the question on an Apple Q&A site.  Your answer is anything but empirical, is not a solution, but a workaround that few if anyone will actually find useful and the voting currently support that. Yes, it is an answer, as I state above I should have stated "not constructive" instead. You are welcome to continue to labour the point further.  Having this answer accepted isn't important.  I don't care about scoring in Meta, I'm responding because it's my responsibility to do so as a mod.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If what I describe at the original quoted answer is anything but empirical, I think I must revise what is to be empiric.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We should avoid extended discussions in chat, and there is nothing more I can add, so I will clear up that last point and then leave the room because I am not sure what is to be gained from further discussion.  If suggesting to a Mac user with a problem to use Ubuntu is an empirical solution, then I can solve my flat tyre on my car by riding a bike.  Technically accurate, practically useless.  Getting hung up on wordplay and semantics helps no-one.  Please accept that you had a timely, polite and extensive response from your question above, and a resolution to your request, and leave it be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5by riding a bike, you just solve another problem, not the an empty tyre, that's quite different from what happens here, I've solved the flat tyre. It just happens that, with the solution, I now must drive in a complete different way... but hey, the tyre, the tyre is full.


















No. Nobody can explain this to you because you're already convinced that you've provided a quality answer and are unpersuaded by arguments to the contrary. 

Open debate is good for the community and I'm glad you raised the issue but every respondent has pretty much told you the same thing. Mike, as is his nature, went (in my opinion) above and beyond to try to coax a quality (or at least inoffensive and somewhat useful) answer from you. You have, in my eyes and apparently to those of others, failed to meet the challenge.  No champion for your side has emerged and it's time to let this one go. I know I speak for everyone responding in saying that I hope you stick around and that I look forward to up voting future answers you provide—if they merit the vote.

IMO, that's the right thing to do in __META__, that's was what needed to be explained, just that, put oneself in third person, expose why you deleted it, and not continue to reenforce wrong assumptions about the original answer.

I've been there many times, in different StackExchange websites. Got many of my questions deleted. Got few of my answers heavily down-voted. It's very frustrating indeed. But I've never been on the other side: being a mod. So I can only assume...

To me, the moderators are doing a very heavy job, most of the time. All of the ones I've crossed by are highly skeptical and knowledgeable people. Almost always they know much more than I do on the site's subject. That's how they got so interested on the subject to dedicate so much time of their life writing and reading about it.

That being said, not all mods are the same, but most of them like to keep things clean. Thus, deleting. Simply put, it was deleted because he thought it was actually a bad answer for the site. He said it so in his own words.

I disagree with his position, but I understand where he comes from. Your answer is indeed and already proven, even today, not well accepted by the community. Almost nobody with a Mac OSX will want to install any other OS. It makes very little sense to do so.

If I were to be a mod I think I'd never delete anyone's post, unless it's plain spam. Ever. You see, I don't mind if things aren't perfectly clean. I love [kbd]CMD[/kbd]+F, gmail and google for the same reasons. That's what makes it even more frustrating when someone does it. It seems to be very inconsiderate.

But, truth is, stuffe wasn't ignoring you at all. I'd say probably no moderator delete any post without some consideration.

In the end, I think this is all just 2 very different worlds colliding and, if you want to "be accepted" in any of the SEN sites, you have to forego many of your pre-conceived concepts. First, about other people hurting you. Nobody here is trying to get that personal. Then, about feelings, emotions and even opinions. Not really welcomed here. As I see it, SEN is about consensus and focus.

I find it unfortunate in some cases, but well, nothing is perfect. Quora is a good counter example in which you can ask much broader questions and, thus, get much less specific answers.

In any case, wish you the best dude. I'm thankful your answer got undeleted already.

The answer in question (as it were) is by far not the worst answer this question received.  Even after reopening this one there are still 3 deleted answers there that you don't get to see.  For every one of them someone had to weigh up all the options I considered and try to act appropriately.  Trust me when I say that you would not appreciate the mess that would be here if we did not try to keep a clean house.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe Wow, is that an average? 3 bad deleted answers per good question? Maybe allowing us to see them, with a hidden link such as the timeline or something, would help to appreciate your work even more!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You would not believe how many deleted answers some q's have (one from today has 21 and counting) but to our credit very few are ever contested.  In the last 4 weeks the number of deleted/closed posts is closer to a 4 figure number than 0, and none are removed without due consideration, although as above sometimes we don't have the time to give each individual attention when providing close reasons (in fact we don't actually have to give any when taking direct action, but those done through a user flag will get marked with the flag if we agreed). It's not easy, and you can't satisfy everyone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe I think just renaming "**closed**" by "**on hold**" would help a great deal already. We would know we can and should take action before it gets "officially" closed, although it's already as closed as it happens today. Then, after a certain while, a day, a week, a month, I don't know, it changes the title from "on hold" to "closed". What you think?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It works exactly as you describe already, changed recently.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe I'm glad I can't contribute with new good ideas because you're already quite ahead of me! :P

These one-per-OS-release questions don't have a right answer (if they did, there would be an accepted answer, but clearly there is no canonical correct answer to them). They aren't an ideal fit for our Q&A format. The Q&A engine doesn't scale particularly well to questions with many pages of answers; the earlier answers pick up votes, and thus remain on page one, and thus pick up more votes (repeat ad infinitum). So I think the questions aren't really a good fit for the site.
BUT…
I do find them useful when I'm first navigating a new operating system. What are the new features and stumbling blocks that aren't what you find in Apple's release PR or the five paragraph release at MacWorld? What are the implications for end users that aren't in John Siracusa's metadata-oriented exhaustive review?
For some previous OS releases, John Gruber had an http://daringfireball.net/2005/04/tiger_details_listinteractive collection of little features that users could contribute to. I really do think there's some utility to this that isn't being met by existing venues, and by having it here, there are some pluses:

users get excited about it (these questions get a lot of votes)
attracts search engine traffic and external links
gives people a chance to contribute who might not otherwise be able to answer people's questions
our voting mechanism gives the list an order in terms of which features are most/least important to other readers beyond the submitter
the community is excited about the new OS (unless we aren't), and want to share our observations
it's fun

These questions take a lot of active maintenance. They don't age particularly well. But when the questions are first set up, they're both exciting and useful (and it's usually two questions a year — hardly filling up the front page for people who dislike these).
So my proposal is this:
We have a set window of time (45 days?) in which the question is open for people to contribute their discoveries about the new OS.  At the end of the window, we close the question to new answers, but leave unlocked so people can continue to vote and edit for another window of time (15 days?).
After the two windows (60 days after original post?) we would lock the question using the "historical significance" reason and potentially ask the community to roll the question and answer into a blog post on the Ask Different Blog showing the features, in voted order, that people discovered about the new OS.

Deleting the question and punting it all to the blog I'm less sure of (but I don't dislike it). But I really like the limited time for answers on these things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is that half a vote for this plan, @IanC.? :-) Seriously, the two parts could operate independently of each other, but my thought was that the collected question might not be the optimal format for long-term archival. Of course, we could **lock** rather than **delete** the question and let it just exist as a collectively gathered summary of what's new, exciting, and otherwise under documented about the new OS.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A limited time lock in would have the benefit of making it feel more like an *event*, I would actually make it shorter, this is a chance for early adopters to talk the toot for a week after release and share the tips.  Anyone waiting on an upgrade etc simply has it for reference later.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm on board with moving it to the blog now too. So one full vote from me. That gets these questions out of the top questions on our site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@stuffe the times are suggestions, but I'm easily persuaded they should be shorter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with a time limit but I would prefer it was kept on the site and not in a blog  so easily found, not all people will update to an OS withinn the short time and it is also to have a reference laterb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5At this point, we're talking about locking the question and leaving it on the site, but **also** putting it on the blog.

I like Community Wikis (and for clarity, I am referring to ones created deliberately for the purposes of listing cool features and tiny things etc), provided they are done right, but think that the current system makes them hard to manage and leads to variable quality.

Reasons I like them:


They make people contribute.
They drive page views, and new users (me!)
They quickly seed the site with really useful SEO keywords for new phrases and features that are introduced in new products.
They get people voting, and commenting.
They are an Event, that brings the community together.
The result (when done right) in a good reference resource that is quite fun to read, and enjoyable to participate in rather than dry reviews and blog posts.  People are not reviewing the OS, or product, they are showing their delight at particular bits which they really appreciate, and helping to crowdsource the Ask Different review, in a way.
The voting aspect means that rather than being a duplication of stuff you can read elsewhere, it's a case of the community ranking those features by most useful.


So, for me I think that they should stay, nominally in the same format that they do now, however with the following provisos


They should not be created by anyone - there is a bit of a painful rush to be the one who creates the one for iOS8 etc, and as a result the first attempt at creating one is often done poorly.
They should be created by a Mod, using a predefined template, preferably several days earlier than required and then temporarily put on hold until they become appropriate to open properly.  This should help in two ways, firstly they get worded correctly, secondly any user trying to duplicate it by creating their own should see it as a duplicate before posting
We should stop trying to force these square pegs into round holes by attempting to word the question in a way that tries to justify it as a genuine Q&A style problem.  Requesting undocumented, or worse under-documented features is just a horrible hack to try to make it a real question.  We know the purpose of these CWs is to talk about cool stuff!.  Every time someone starts commenting on the answers showing links to where an answer is already documented online, or arguing about what constitutes documented, and it just turns some of the comments into little sniping matches that saps the fun.  Let's just be honest about the purpose of the questions.
The answers need to be policed more carefully.  No more one line answers with a screenshot that don't add to the equation, let's get people being effusive about why they contributed this answer.  Some of this would be down to the question wording to ensure people aren't just racing to tick off the features lists.
The whole thing should be protected for a day or so after opening so only repped users can set the ball rolling with quality answers that serve as an example of how to answer.
They should be appropriately tagged with a tag that shows that it is more of a participation piece, than a question - Not sure what we would use, other sites have the idea of "canonical" answers etc.
Our site guidelines should be updated to reflect the above as CW policy, to show that for appropriately created CWs they are on topic


The above should go a long way to making them more enjoyable for everyone.  Not having a clear policy (whichever one is agreed) always invites some random Mod or high rep users from other sites to come and poke fun at our site.  These questions are unique in style to Ask Different, they don't appear on any other SE site, and while they are clearly not a genuine Q&A format, sure that is exactly why we have the concept of the Community Wiki - for what other purpose does it exist if not for the couple of times a year when we might want to do the above.  Other sites have their own idiosyncrasies that are not a perfect SE fit, whether it's "Name that book" or recommendation based questions.  This is Ask Different, not Ask Like a all the other SE sites using this prescriptive format for every single contribution.

There remains however, one problem that I do not know how to resolve.  As these are genuine point in time questions, it's invariable that the earliest answers often gain the most votes.  Sometimes it's almost as if people read the list up voting every answer, and in this way the highest voted answer is often just the earliest.  I don't know how to fix this, other than to see if we can just sort question answer randomly for CWs.

In general, users should vote down insubstantial answers, not flag them for moderator attention. When we say "no more one line answers" — what happens to one-line answers? Because I don't want to encourage people to flag bad answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do *not* want to see these become flag targets either, but getting people to do more than outline the feature they are answering with in the minimum words - To make a made up example "You can now have an empty from home screen in iOS7" followed by a pic of an empty first home screen is *dull*, and users should be encouraged (via careful question wording, and comments/edits where appropriate) to say why they chose to contribute that, so "You can have an empty first home screen, perfect for neat freaks or people who love their wallpaper too much!" injects personality and prevents dry listingsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5users should be encouraged via commends/edits, but I just wanted to make it clear that our threshold for deletion is "not an answer"; our job is not to delete wrong or duplicate answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, and for clarity by 'police' I really mean *encourage to be awesome* rather than *get trigger happy with mod actions to make people fall into line*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wish policing was always about "encouraging people to be awesome" and not about "getting trigger-happy to make people fall into line" — in real life, I'm afraid the second is more prevalent than I'd hope.


















Fine by me, so long as it's a genuine problem, one that you have showed effort in resolving, and one that is on topic then that's fine.  We don;t just do Apple software support, we look after you guys running apps on Apple hardware.  One potential issue is that your question may be flagged as too localised, depending on the nature of your (unspecified) problem, but if give it a go - even if the question is not perfect, we can help you fix it up so it passes muster.

I recently earned the Famous Question badge [10k views] for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63911/app-store-an-unknown-error-has-occurred-apple-support-fix-was-only-temporaryApp Store "An Unknown Error Has Occurred", Apple Support fix was only temporary. How fix permanently?

I note that there are still low votes on both the question, the answer, and a hackintosh specific answer. Is this a known phenomenon within Apple.SE or the entire SE family of sites? 

I am not complaining here, I asked and answered my own question. I am proud that it is viewed often. I hope that means people are searching, finding my question, and getting the answer they need. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is having a question with high views and low votes common?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, it's happened here before.

More than your one, but still that means that 9,997 people read it and decided not to vote for it :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does the SE api provide a means to query for questions with more than a certain number of views and show the vote totals?

This is, I believe, a systemic problem with the user base of Ask Different*. Sites like Stack Overflow, where the approach to Q&A was pioneered and little better ingrained in the user base, don't seem to have it quite as bad as we do**.

We attract a lot of search queries for problems and solutions that would otherwise have lead people to more traditional Q&A type stuff: MacWorld, blogs, traditional forums, etc. We have great content here that covers a wide range and great depth of subject matter, so we pull a good deal of search traffic from these topics. Unfortunately, the people looking for answers to these topics tend to not be greatly familiar with our Q&A approach: if you like something, vote it up. We get a lot of "thank you" type posts and comments we have to clean up as mods -- which is pretty clear indicator if you ask me that people visiting here often don't get that you don't write a thank you, you say thanks by clicking the upvote button.

So how do we solve this problem? That, I'm afraid, I have no good answers for.

* Completely speculative, I have no hard data for this.

I would have rather cut more bullet points, but as you can see, I https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/105391/revisionstook quite a cut of text from your question to reduce the scope and make it less broad:



From our https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questionshelp page on closed questions you can see why I removed several bullet points to eliminate the "too broad" problem that I saw with the question.

Specifically, how to transfer an entire mac to a new system is quite a broad question in and of itself. Here you complicate things by having no clear picture of what you actually need. I saw your question as asking best practice to set things up - based on how that is answered, you might be able to ask how to back up each proposed "answer" as a follow on question.

I still think the question is quite broad since it seems to be three questions:


What partition format is readable by OS A and OS B where you specify exactly what version of Mac and Windows you run.
How do you see upgrading / reinstalling windows as affecting Mac OS X or risk losing data? (and wouldn't having a Time Machine backup remedy things should windows hose your Mac side of things?)
Why complicate things to have people guess whether OS X upgrade will or will not affect things on Windows side. That alone would be a good single question.


Basically, the more narrow of a problem you can phrase, the more likely it will be useful to a wide variety of people. Having small, thought through, clear questions allows you and others to chain together facts and answers to make a nice summary post / question should you find some conflict between the individual pieces. As it stands, I would tend to close a question that was asked as yours is now, but I wanted to reopen it to see how it plays out and whether we can get some answers that help you since you did show effort to edit it as we asked.

In essence, the "reversion" was that we asked you to narrow the question and to some extent you broadened it - so rather than ask you to go back and do your work over, I attempted to show what I saw as an improvement. Let's see what other moderators think - if they could edit or perhaps offer constructive criticism to get a) you to understand why the edits happened b) a question that's likely to get some answers.

Third, we can have longer discussions and perhaps come to a better solution for you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike It would be more correct to consider diff from your version to the my version just before the close (#5 in the [revision list](http://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/105391/revisions)). Much less changes compared to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@yurkennis Please post the diff you consider most relevant as an answer to your question here. That way everyone can see what you are saying. IMO - your rev 1 was too broad and all you did was add content in each of your 5 revisions leading up to the closure, but since the edit history is public, please show if we made some mistake.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike [This diff](https://en.wikivoyage.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ADenisYurkin%2FAskDifferent&diff=2454078&oldid=2454077) is much more relevant.


















I can't really think why this would not be a good idea:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/adminadmin 28 uses (9 this year)
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/administratoradministrator 14 uses (5 this year)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the admin and administrator tags on the main site be merged?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On first inspection, it looks like a good idea to me.


















I would say, let's first flush out what these tags mean to the site by having someone write a wiki summary for both tags (or at least propose what the tag should mean for the site in an answer here). Unless we have a good reason to keep them, let's just clean up the questions and let the nightly unused tag culling put them both out of their misery.

What sort of questions should be collected under https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/administratorhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/administrator and what sort of questions should be collected under https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/adminhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/admin

It's not clear to me that we even need either of the tags and really we could edit the questions / merge them down to point to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/windowsWindows or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osxOS X

We could merge and then clean up later as it appears both tags suffer from vague use patterns.

I do not see why this sould be CW.

The question could be made a bit more general re the iOS versions but the answer seems to stay the same. Both seem good enough and covering an explict question so that they can be a normal answer

(without making it a Community Wiki)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question can't be too broad - but I would try and see. And Community Wiki is not relevantt here - mainly used for open ended questions asking for lists


















In the most literal sense, the answer to your question appears to be "no, this is not allowed" in the sense that the many votes you cast yesterday for a single user were invalidated, as were the many votes another user cast for you today. This is an automated part of the voting mechanism; the system sometimes disallows votes based on its (unpublished) criteria, and clearly these votes were not allowed, because if they had been allowed, your score would be higher.

On a more philosophical level, the question remains whether they should be allowed, or why they are not allowed. While anyone with sufficient reputation can click the up arrow on anyone's post but their own up to 40 times a day if they feel so moved, there are some underlying "shoulds" in the way the system is designed. Ideally, users vote for posts based on their content and not on their author. If there is widespread evidence that someone's voting patterns seem to be based on who the author is and not on simply what posts they find helpful, the system is designed in such a way to identify and reverse votes that seem to be based on a pattern of voting for or against a person. The moderators are neither informed about what these patterns are nor do we have any say in intervening in them.

Personally I think the criteria should be published.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've learned something about the criteria primarily because I've both given and received votes that were later invalidated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can do that, but not all at once. Vote for answers you think are good, and in the process, you'll end up rewarding the users you want to reward. But focus on the answers, not the users, and the system will cooperate with you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You really aren't supposed to earn more than 25 points from a single user for answering a question unless they chose to award a bounty: 10 points for the upvote and 15 points for an accepted answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you know what the limit is? 10 votes? 15 votes?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see. It doesn't look like you've actually answered the question at http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/110265/10733. So technically, you don't earn any reputation for that.

Technically speaking, all close votes are the same, irregardless of the close reason given by the individual voter. So if there are different vote reasons given, either the majority or (as in this case) the most meaningful reason wins.

As migration is a subset of the "off topic" close reason, it still counts as a close vote for you (and you didn't do anything wrong either). Migrating questions to different SE sites is always a tricky thing anyway.

You seem to have two questions overall:


What can be the best option online to buy a most lasting and robust battery replacement? 
How can I ensure before ordering that it's closest to the genuine battery possible?


The first question doesn't work here. I can appreciate your predicament but understand that answering it well means it's: a) likely specific to where ever you live; b) only relevant for a short period of time because prices changes, retailers come and go, technology marches on.

The second question seems okay though -- when ordering a battery online, how can you ensure it's either genuine Apple or at least Apple compatible to some degree? That's a question with some general longevity to it, especially if you focus the question on how, when doing DIY repairs to Apple equipment, to ensure you're buying the right components and not ending up with partially-compatible pieces. It could even be made non-specific to batteries. That's a good question IMO.

I'd suggest shortening the whole thing down to something like:


  How do I make sure I'm buying Apple-compatible replacement parts when performing DIY repairs?
  
  I live in a place where Apple has no official presence. Support and repairs are done by Apple-authorized service providers. I'm fairly savvy with electronics and would like to save on the authorized repair markup and do my own repairs. I'm currently in need of a battery replacement in my MacBook Pro, but other repairs may come up as I try to extend the life of my Apple investment.
  
  How can I be certain that any replacement parts I order for my repairs that are obviously Apple genuine parts, are at least Apple compatible parts?


That seems to capture the spirit of your question, not wanting to order the wrong thing when going DIY in a country where returning an order can be problematic and expensive, but without asking for specific purchase advice that would quickly become obsolete.

Does that help?

The rules say 220 by 250.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This ad has been working for almost two years. No, it won't be rejected.

Have you ruled out your browser as changing the text?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now I have edited the title of my question, to circumvent the auto-“correction”.

My initial analysis is the correct characters are stored in the database, yet the rendered code strips html entities and changes the standard quote into smart (or dumb depending on your outlook) quotes. 

My guess is this transformation of text in question titles is intentional and might even have a technical reason relating to URL encoding or other database / security concerns. 

Let's see what the site developers say when they see this bug report.

A succinct answer would be there's no good reason to split off shortcut and hotkey related questions from general keyboard questions. (The synonyms point to keyboard, not the other way around as your title states.)



We can absolutely change the synonym and meta is the place to build consensus. The next step would be someone detailing what the actual wording of the keyboard  and keyboard-shortcut tags so we can discuss, vote or adjust as needed?

If there were enough supports to break them apart, then we would want to have a second post here to start cataloging which ones belong in the shortcut category in which ones remain in keyboard. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for your response.  I have updated my post with a set of proposed descriptions for these two tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome. We can let people's vote on the question be indicative of consensus. Personally I think things are better with less tags, but I'll wait and look over some questions to see if there's a positive side to what you propose.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for your insight and I understand that this determination will be made based on the overall consensus.  I'm just hoping enough people take the time to read the issue.  Now where can I go campaign my cause. :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, I fixed my title so that the synonym relationship between the tags makes more sense as you pointed out.


















As of mid 2013, the wiki tags indicate that osx-server is only for Snow Leopard and older server installs. I have been retagging server.app to all Lion and newer questions and removing the osx-server tags when it's not used on 10.6 and earlier.

Perhaps we will want to re-evaluate this and make a synonym to point them all to the same tag and/or re-tag old questions.

The only problem is that old server installs aren't served well by server.app but the number of people that need that distinction will shrink rapidly. Also, I wonder if we can prevent use of the old tag and still link things so the new tag feeds both in terms of badge counts and searching.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This sounds like a good policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a little bit swimming up stream (so to speak) since many people want to use osx-server tag even now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the end, isn't it still osx-server.  The delivery mechanism of the server installation files shouldn't matter, should it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To add, if a person has installation issues regarding a flavor of osx-server, they can further qualify their post with tags like "mac-appstore", or other pertinent tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was actually doing exact the same thing (reading a lot of questions tagged #osxserver) and got to the point that it is completely wrong to remove the #osxserver tag!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hugelshofer Thanks for the great efforts to retag. I have one request, try to fix the posts while you are editing them. Most of the retags you mentioned had pretty obvious problems, so I'd like to empower you to fix multiple things when editing :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I am not very good at writing. I am better in formatting, structuring and analysing stuff. Text editing takes me a huge effort. But I'll try when I see typos and heavy grammar mistakes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hugelshofer Think of it this way. When the typos literally make it impossible to figure out what's going on or large portions of the text can be cut or formatted properly to clarify the issue - go ahead and make an edit. Simple grammatical errors and typos of an otherwise understandable post probably can be left alone. For a new post, if the title, body and tags only require minor corrections I'll probably edit. For older posts, the bar is even higher on what is a substantial improvement for grammar alone.


















For the user-info card to be expanded on hover you need more than 1000 rep, and a somewhat meaningful about me excerpt (more than 50 chars of text). Your about me isn't being recognized as such, so no hover card for you.

Is this a new change on child metas or dig child metas have no user cards in the first place?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I totally misunderstood the first question, due to the context of things that were happening at that time. I've updated my answers, as this has nothing to do with the top bar. To further elaborate, the user info hover cards feature is behind a site setting that can be turned off for each  individual site, but is currently enabled on all sites, so it should work as long as the criteria mentioned above are fulfilled.


















This isn't a bug, but is actually seen as a feature.

When a reviewer chooses improve, the community user approves the initial edit immediately to unblock the post and let the reviewer make changes. So, in this case, Peter made the first edit that needed review and you caused community to approve and then you made the second edit.

The best thing is to bury the post, not editing or commenting at all. Don't feed the behavior.


Flag as spam. There's a system in place that detects this activity and will help prevent the spammer from continuing that activity and creating new accounts. This is important since https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/58035/165931three spam flags banishes the question from the front page. 6 such flags deletes and locks the question which is what we want for this.
Vote to close the question. It costs you zero reputation and you get the question in the close queue for other reviewers to see.
Most of all, do not comment or edit or bump it up by making any activity on the post. It's that type of recognition and eyeballs the spammer is looking for.


I've made a chat room for http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/12395/spam-on-askdifferentdiscussion and to document this and if the rate of spam keeps getting worse, we can work with the site developers to see if a blacklist or other change can make the site less appealing for this sort of activity.

Thanks again for all the great editing, moderation and flagging. Keep it up and we can keep the door open to people that have legitimate questions and not make the regular users too irritated at this sort of post.

Also, it appears that our site isn't the only one with an uptick as we're not seeing several of the patterns that other sites are dealing with. If you are interested, there is a nice thread on the Ask Ubuntu meta:

In the case here - flag is the most important. If you only do one thing, do that. I would prefer you also down vote it as that buries it between the time a binding close vote arrives. Hopefully everyone that can vote to close knows to do that if they can as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My reading is don't down vote because it buries the article so we don't get the flags quickly enoughb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't see anyone handling these flags not killing it, but I suppose for some **much less blatant** spam, hiding it is bad. Perhaps it should be "flag then vote to close" if you feel somehow burying it will delay the execution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It could be that this is meta SO I am quoting and getting 6 (or for us 3?) flags kills it without a moderator so they want it to be visible. Also kills it quickerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In our case, multiple flags won't get it seen to faster than a single flag, so there is no benefit to leave it at the front or near the top to annoy yet more users.  Flag, down vote, and pat yourself on the back, possible after hunting for similar terms in *search* (these things tend to arrive in batches, if you find one, chances are there's another)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One flag per post is enough to get a mod to look into it. But downvoting indeed buries the post and prevents further close votes, so for those users who have enough reputation to propose closing this might be better than downvoting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems voting to close is better overall than to vote down in many circumstances - so let's let that be the step #2.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I presume close as off-topic — if so, is there a preferred custom reason?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside Referring to the meta stack overflow http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/193916/why-shouldnt-i-downvote-spam-that-ive-already-flagged it is flagging as spam not closing that sets up the special procedures. This flag does not have to be handled by moderators so is like closingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark Yes, I understand this — I simply wanted to know if there was a standard preferred reason that I should use for the closure. So far I've been using "This question appears to be off-topic because it is spam" (and then deleting the comment) but wondered if I should be using something else.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The average flag handling time for the day, week, month, quarter, and recent history is consistently under a half hour. Any spam post flagged as such will die a quick and permanent death rather rapidly. I understand that if it picks up enough spam flags it doesn't require moderator attention, but moderator attention happens pretty darn quickly around here.

This is a known behavior where others can take review tasks in the time between when you looked and when your request hit the server.

To check on this, you can look at the https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/first-posts/historyreview history for the queue that just has shown no tasks to see who handled the items that were just recently outstanding.

This is far more common on large sites (like Stack Overflow) where dozens of questions arrive each minute and it's not uncommon to have hundreds of reviews happen within a 60 second interval.

This CSS piece is messing up and causing a weird behaviour when you get close with your mouse to the "Add Comment" Button.

This applies to both, Meta and AskDifferent.

This piece of CSS is also related to the issue:

I believe two things are in play. 


Migration only works for new questions (https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/151890/disable-migration-for-questions-older-than-60-dayspast 60 days, migration is disabled on all SE sites)
Each site can request limited sites for non-diamond moderators to choose for migration and this site in particular has only a couple listed.

We have had several questions about people buying second hand phones and some have been closed as duplicate.

I'm now convinced that we should have at least two questions, possibly three with good votes and great answers to avoid having lots of duplicate posts on this issue. What do people see as a good solution to solve this?

My three canonical questions would be:


How secure is Activation Lock?
I know the person (or am the person) that controls the iCloud account that's now locking my device (or one I sold / gave away / donated)?
I don't know the person that controls the iCloud account locking my device?


Can someone answer or help find / ask these canonical questions on the site and confirm that my thinking is sound here?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which of these questions should remain open?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I thought the SO potion on duplicates is to leave all them open so more likely to catch all the google hits but make them point to questions with good answersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mark I'm not proposing deletion, merging or anything other the close which keeps them in google and other search indexes.


















I agree with the three situations as canonical questions:


  
  How secure is Activation Lock?
  


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/104888/how-secure-is-activation-lock-on-ios-7How secure is Activation Lock on iOS 7 (and later)?


  
  I know the person (or am the person) that controls the iCloud account that's now locking my device (or one I sold / gave away / donated)?
  


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/how-can-i-bypass-activation-lockHow can I bypass Activation Lock?

…however, I think the title could be clarified a bit, as it doesn't appear to focus on the fact that the Activation Lock was activated by the 'previous owner' and therefore doesn't fit the third scenario.


  
  I don't know the person that controls the iCloud account locking my device?
  


This seems very much like the previous scenario and I believe could be answered by the existing answer to the above question.

Personally, I'd like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/how-can-i-bypass-activation-lockHow can I bypass Activation Lock? to be reopened, but with a new title that clarifies the focus on 'previous owner'.

There has been a situation where it's not a previous owner but themselves that don't have access to the Apple ID any more. This question could suit that situation nicely: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116010/our-ipad-is-locked-and-were-not-sure-of-the-apple-id-icloud-passwordOur iPad is locked and we're not sure of the Apple ID / iCloud password

If anyone's noticed, I've kind of just jumped right in and started trying to snipe bounties on this site. I know that this is acceptable behavior https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/127022/249673over on SO, but since this site is much less aggressive (which is such a breath of fresh air), I just wanted to double check.
(I've updated my profile here to reflect that I do more or less have the credentials.)

I'm not trying to show off or anything — mostly, I'm really tired of not having 200 rep on any one SO site and therefore not being able to comment on sister sites.

My main focus these days is working on my coding skills, because at 26, I am in no uncertain terms retired from support, after an abortive shot at starting a consulting company (did well, but 8-10 billing hours of Mac support + run business = mental breakdown. The end-up-in-hospital kind.).

Also, I did notice that someone apparently awarded my a bounty on an answer where it seems the person who asked the question and posted the bounty seemed to have gone AWOL past the deadline, and despite having an answer of their own for the same question. Which is both very nice and a smart idea since otherwise good answers would likely slip through and people like me would get discouraged.

So if I can answer a tricky question, why not, right? That kind of why bounties exist?

Also, I do still of course still have Apple questions, and probably will be putting any rep gained here into a bountied question of my own shortly. But StackExchange basically makes my head spin just https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/221008/etiquette-rules-or-advice-on-which-site-to-pose-a-question-or-why-are-theretrying to figure out which site to even ask the question on.

I presume you are referring to [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103800/how-can-i-enable-time-machine-encryption-on-the-command-line) but actually the bounty was [not offered by the person that asked the question](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hblXD.png). (The only exception to this is when Community offers half the bounty to the highest upvoted answer greater than two since the bounty started.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nope, it's this one, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119964/is-it-possible-to-use-totalterminal-with-go2shell and I thought it would go to you for that very reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Colas (the OP) specifically [chose to award you](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bVPRj.png) the bounty for that one :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll address two side questions that should probably be edited out of the question - you have enough reputation to chat, so use that when your head spins. Also, you have asked a multi part question here and answered a multi-part question and hose are generally bad and discouraged. They make it hard to fit on the right site, they make it hard for bounties to work, and they make it hard to get clean, neat Q+A. Much of the difficulty might stem from questions that aren't thought through enough to be one core question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks both. I was confused by the fact that one can award the bounty but not chose a correct answer. I'll keep all of this in mind.


















Yes - choosing to only answer bountied questions is fine as long as each post adheres generally to the help center guidelines. 

Also, consider that the community gives and takes reputation points by voting. If you create a perception of taking more than you give - that can take time and effort to overcome. 

We haven't had to suspend or ban anyone for bounty sniping thus far - but there also are people that are known to show up on the site only when a contest is running, or when holiday hats are "earned" or solely to earn rep to drop and bounty their "heavy" question on the site that "really need an immediate answer". (and the above generalizations are not at all directed at you Geoff, but do want to openly acknowledge that some have done this before and will probably continue to do so in the future)

I hope over time people, and you specifically, will choose to answer questions that need great answers. I expect for all but the most rare expert at answering choice questions, far more reputation accrues from picking questions based on your ability to provide a quality answer rather than the rare moment when it has a bounty open on it - but that choice is certainly yours to make. 

I did want to address what might be confusing about your question to others and perhaps yourself. 

Bounties are a contract between the site and he person spending them. 

Put aside the awarding of the bounty for a moment. If you spend a bounty - you forfeit the points immediately and get the question promoted for a week. That is the requirement. 

Optional things that could happen:


the bounty gets cancelled and refunded which immediately removes the promotion going forward but also credits the reputation to the offerer. 
the sponsor and only the sponsor can award it to any answer they choose
only in the case where the offerer declines or is unable to award the bounty, the code operating as the community user awards half he bounty to the highest upvoted answer added after the bounty.

Also, trying too hard or forcing something that's not ready rarely works well - being mindful often prevents falling into either trap, and aids self-correction when you do.

Networking is very general and large, DHCP will narrow it much down. 

As DHCP is a dynamically created range of IP which will be automatically assigned to a device.
Networking on the other hand is very large.

If a user decides to enter the Tag DHCP it will be a much easier subject to handle than just Networking.

I'll add an excerpt and other information if it can be done.

There are two things to consider:


The function of a tag summary and tag wiki
How to properly attribute Creative Commons licensed work. 


Both of those reasons make me feel we shouldn't just copy other tag content. A tag isn't a dictionary and the same word should have different meanings on different sites by definition. Take "network/networking" as it will be different here as on a workplace site. Even on computer sites like here, Super User and Ask Ubuntu - explaining what types of questions should get tagged as networking can and should be different. 

So, if there isn't any controversy or disagreement on use of a tag, the actual words attached to them are of little use in practice. I would say, in the case you mention - we would be served best by merging the r tag into open source since it won't make sense to most of the users of Mac, iOS and Apple Services as well as be more confusing to people typing other tags than the benefit of allowing some people to search for that one open-source software package. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No for open-source as you could argue that the search people want to use is statistics to find R etc. i.e. the activity you want is important not how you do it.


















Personally I disagree with this, since every question tagged dhcp should be tagged networking anyway and if someone tags with dhcp but not networking then the question may be missed by those that are following the networking tag (this would mean that one would have to follow two tags) and would probably lead to the question being edited to add the networking tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll add: It's also very likely that any question about DHCP would have already mentioned that term specifically, so a tag adds little, whereas a question about DHCP might not have mentioned the word "networking", so that tag is additive.

New answers to old questions can be anything from spam to gem, so it's kind of difficult to give a simple answer on that. But in general the same rules apply both for current and for old topics

I recently made a substantial edit to this question:

The OP then further edited the post to change an I to an i:



It was a very minor edit and the rollback would be equally minor, so should this be rolled back?

It is a little awkward.


















IMHO there is something wrong with the now available OS X Server tags!
When I did some extensive re-taging edits on the 'OSX-Server' tagged Questions I realised that people would mostly not adhere to the given meaning of the http://Apple.StackExchange.com/tags/osx-server/infotags-wiki but actually to the naming convention that Apple has chosen for its products.

As of now, Apple calls it "OS X Server" and the App to manage the Server is called Server.app <-- So, one is the App and the other is the Server System itself. 

If then added the core (Mac) OS X system version name tag (e.g. #Mavericks), we get the full picture of which Operating System we are talking about.





But what about the old Mac Server System versions from Apple?

Well, they were called Mac OS X Server 10.x and the Software to manage the Server was called 'Server Admin' and 'Workgroup Manager'.



tags needed for 10.0 - 10.6

- Mac-OS-X-Server (the full Mac Server Version)
- Server-Admin.app
- Workgroup-Manager.app




tags needed for 10.7 - 10.9

- OS-X-Server (as an add-on to an installed OS X) 
- Server.app

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ask Different needs correct tags for 'Mac OS X Server' (10.0 - 10.6) and 'OS X Server (10.7 - 10.9)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As you can see, I sugest to change even to change the existing tag, so it would be easier to migrate to the new tags.

Let's keep the discussion on server tags on one thread.  Also - things can take a week to a month to get sorted out. Are you perhaps just being impatient? Let me know what you want. I can reopen this, but that will likely slow the effort to form consensus.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike because it is a meta discussion to be done. It is way broader than your original Question. And as told before: I did not repost my Answer. I took my text and invested some serious time to edit it and then posted a starter post for a real discussion. Yes it looks very similar, BUT it is not. And it is here because it is not an answer to your original Question. I had not the courage in the first place to put it as a new discussion. And I can wait ...

Cheers and thanks for explaining what you wants the post to be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please do a little research how our users use the Server related tags. e.g. The wiki had been visited 40 times and nobody saw the nice grammar typo (for 2 years). I'm serious about this. Nobody cares about how some admins set the tags meaning. They just use it as they like.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@josh-k what's your view on this discussion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tony-williams Hi, as a main contributor to the OSX-Server topic, I would like to read or see your vote on this very discussion. THX for your time.



















  can we purge this tag from the system


Yes, please. 


  … create a synonym to iOS?


idevice is not a word (agreed), so there's no need for it to be a synonym of anything.

The number to the right of the tag is the number of times you've posted with that tag — questions with that tag and answers on questions with that tag. Similarly (yet substantially different) is the number on the left: the sum of votes received on the posts.



For example, here is one of the tags from my user page:



The right number is calculated based on the total number of interactions I've had with the tag. In the example above, I have asked https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A37797+%5Bosx%5D+is%3Aquestion5 questions tagged with osx and https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A37797+%5Bosx%5D+is%3Aanswer178 answers to questions tagged with osx. Therefore, I have interacted with the osx tag 183 times, hence the number shown on the right.

The number on the left is the sum of the votes that I have received for my posts. In the example above, https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A37797+%5Bosx%5D+is%3Aquestion+score%3A14 questions have accumulated 12 votes and https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A37797+%5Bosx%5D+is%3Aanswer+score%3A1134 answers have accumulated 301 votes. Therefore, my total score for the osx tag is 313, hence the number shown on the left.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So is the number to the right only for questions, and the number to the left for both questions and answers? Or do both sides take both Q and A into account?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dwightk Edited to add clarification


















It's gone (for now). Ping us if it surfaces again after the 24 hour period needed to clean it up now that no questions are using that tag.

Again, a closed question is just fine if we don't expect it needing any new answers. They are still searchable by anyone and can do good.

The first thing to do is wait 24 hours. This allows the serial voting mechanism to undo the votes if you have been a victim of serial voting.

I am a very nice person after all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I doubt that someone that was hot would stop at only three down votes, but perhaps they had a change of heart after seeing some of your excellent posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike If a user targets a number of users with a few downvotes each, surely the system still flags this, even though it wasn't on a single user?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The algorithms are a) not disclosed publicly b) likely to change when the developers care to tweak things so any guesses here today might be totally wrong in 6 months or two years. I'm not aware of any requirement to not vote quickly across multiple users. Targeting is when one account targets another. Votes should belong to the exact wording of a post in relation to the guidelines and not to who posted the words.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Indeed, yet 'targeted' voting is not an official term that I've encountered like serial voting which appears to not have any requirement on targeting a certain user. Is there a Meta(.SO) post regarding targeted voting?


















I would say that only three votes could just be a coincidence and not some campaign. Your java post is clearly controversial - with more than a dozen people disagreeing with your stance that installing java is safe (or even a qualified safe thing to do). 

Also, voting is anonymous to all users - even elected moderators, so you won't be able to know who votes unless people offer a comment. Even then, they could comment and be an up-voter or non-voter, so not always are critical comments an indication of voting.

You can rest assured, that if one person continues to down vote your content, that pattern will get raised to the moderation team and we will handle that privately - like we handle all vote irregularity situations.

Here is some documentation on serial and targeted voting. (Where serial is targeted voting within a short time span):

But it is not worth doing it this time.


















Systematically, I'm not sure there's a tool / method to handle the abstract idea, however all seem manageable with the existing moderator tools on a case by case basis. 


Any moderator (user with sufficient reputation) can flag the deleted questions that are savable and flag the questions that are closed as dupe that would be worth reopening. 


Again, a closed question is a fine state for a question to sit for months or even an indeterminate amount of time if we don't expect it needing any new answers. Closed questions are still visible to all and can do good.

In the case of the last question, a vote for deletion might be a place to start on reviewing these.

Within a question or answer is it possible to write a footnote?

For example, if I use a tricky term, for many readers, some of them will
understand it at first reading, but some others might prefer a
correct explanation. To do this within web pages or written technical
documents I use footnotes.

Is this possible within StackExchange?

In my eyes they are related, and just a degree of how sustained your moderation efforts on the site relate to the voting buttons.

My hope is that everyone that decides to chase the Electorate badge is then so used to the positive effect of voting, that the site grows people that help moderate what content is featured.

We have, in general, a voting problem here on AD (there really isn't enough of it, especially question and answer up voting) despite having a fairly decent traffic and posting profile for the site.

Up and down votes are good and should be sent out fairly liberally, especially for questions where they don't cost you any rep.

I agree with @bmike: an up vote means an answer was useful.

Which is different from most correct or even completely correct really. Though I wouldn't encourage you to up vote anything that was blatantly incorrect.

The question has attracted a bunch of "me too" answers which have been deleted (and which you can't see). The software behind AskDifferent automatically sets a topic to "protected" if the ratio between deleted and non-deleted questions gets too high.

I've unprotected it again for the moment, if it keeps attracting "me too" answers it will get procted again automatically.

I gave what I thought was a possible solution this morning (early morning CET) and now all traces have vanished.

Answer questions! Vote! Participate!

The 1.8k in that user's profile badge is short form for 1800. Where 1800 is their reputation score on the Ask Different site. They've earned that reputation by participating in the site. Rep is mainly gained by answering questions correctly and having those answered voted up and accepted as the most correct answer for questions. But you also get rep for questions that are voted up. And other actions on the site can earn you rep too like peer reviewing pending edits and suggesting tag wikis and so on.

As for the flair badge for the site:


  (please note that only sites where you have more than 200 reputation will appear, and that flair is only updated once every 24-36 hours.)


This is from the flair page itself. You can see it here for your user account: https://stackoverflow.com/users/1369972/rajneesh071/flairhttps://stackoverflow.com/users/1369972/rajneesh071/flair

You don't have enough rep on Ask Different yet to get a flair badge. You need +200 rep on any site for a badge. Keep going! You're almost there!

Is it possible for SE to correct words according to a list or something?

Example:


IOS, Ios ios should be iOS
IPAD, ipad, Ipad, IPad etc should be iPad
apple should be Apple


These "mistakes" occur many times resulting in edits. I don't mind editing them, but if it is technically possible...?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it possible to autocorrect words?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5hey, newbies like me gotta get points somehow ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dwightk I fully understand you'd like to get points ASAP. But just editing for IPad to iPad is a bit pointless IMO. I did accept your edit though.


















I've a couple of times gotten feedback on flags where I selected "not an answer" which says "...should possibly be an edit, comment, another question, or deleted altogether..." and (for example the most recent time) the reviewer declined the flag, commenting that they weren't comfortable deleting it. In this particular situation it should probably be converted to a comment, not deleted.

I seem to do better selecting "other" and specifically saying "this should be a comment" but after reading the small print on "not an answer" I thought I'd just go with that one. 

Which is best? Selecting other and pointing out the reason, or selecting the correct flag type and getting declined. 

Edit: 

To be clear, I'm not offended that my flag was declined, I just don't want to irritate the flag reviewers.

If you want to link to some of the flags, it might help others as well as you since only moderators can see your flagging details easily.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5e.g. this one: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107493/mavericks-finder-spins-when-opening-folders/124906#124906 which is "I've had this problem for 2 months" with an incomplete portion of another answer copied and pasted below with no quotation indication.

I'm not sure what a good comment on that answer would look like.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5oh, and I didn't see that first discussion because my original search was too specific, I should have searched with just "flagging" before asking a new one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another example (and the reason I asked) is this one: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116951/whats-behind-the-hairdryer-fix-for-broken-iphone-4s-wifi/124862#124862


















As cosmetically-infuriating as these typos can be, they don't obscure the meaning or intent behind a question or answer so I would just: don't sweat it. I think you'll go a little crazy trying to right all those wrongs on this site if you can't find a way to live with them.

As a counterpoint (I would just comment, but I can't put images in comments):

This is what we see on the flagging page:



Under "it is not an answer" we see "It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether". It sounds like you are considering all the flags as requests for deletion when the flagging page mentions 3 other options. 

I will try to start commenting and voting rather than flagging (except for spam) but I am confused about the phrasing the flagging interface offers.

I think a tangential confusion stems from new users not being able to comment and so they go to the answer field (or maybe they don't even see the comment option, but even if they did it isn't an option)

 and yes, this should probably be flagged because it isn't an answer :D

I would say - we might need to have a discussion about _when_ to flag something as opposed to just voting / commenting / or voting to close a question. Let's see if you can post some items to chat where you're not certain how (or if) to flag and we can see if discussing those specific instances helps you put the guidelines into action (and also helps us moderators be sure we're on the same page handling flags).

I’m using an old version of IOS Safari (original iPad).  Of course, there a lot of minor irritations with the UI.  One of them is that on all SE sites, selecting a suggested tag takes anywhere from two taps to more than I’m willing to retry.

Except here.  Here, “it just works.”

Is it different JavaScript?

(edit)
Sigh.  Never mind.  Until now, I selected a tag with one tap every time in the site only.  This time, I gave up after ten taps.

I agree the naming of the options is confusing here. 

The solution you want is Looks Good.

Basically Looks Good means I have reviewed the post and taken all the actions I can do. Skip always means I don't know what do to here - leave this in queue for another reviewer. 

See this https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/143469/in-the-new-review-beta-what-does-the-looks-good-button-actually-doquestion about what the buttons do and this https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/147867/late-answers-and-first-posts-encouraging-unnecessary-actionsone for why this came about

Two factors will increase the minumum bounty. 


If you answered the question, you start at 100 for a bounty. 
If you offer multiple bounties on one post, it increases exact iteration.

I've put a hold on this question:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125358/does-anyone-know-any-good-diagnostic-toolsDoes anyone know any good Diagnostic tools?


It strikes me as something we want on the site, but as worded, it's far too vague to be searchable IMO. 

We don't have a specific ban on software-recommendataion questions, but the general advice from Stack Overflow is still helpful to me in deciding when to step in and pause a question:


  Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or favorite off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it.


This question could easily be reopened if there is an actual problem being solved. If so, let's edit it to describe the problem and then document what has been done so far to solve it.

If it's meant to be a subjective question, it might need some significant tightening of scope. From our help center:


  
  every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”
  your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”
  there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”
  you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”
  


To relate those words to the post in question. It seems like the following is happening:


What's your favorite diagnostic tool for Mac?
It's not actually stating a tool, but the answers read like what I would expect if someone posted "I use AHT for diagnosing Mac, what do you use?"
I think a more precise statement of what problem needs diagnosis, this could be reopened rapidly with an edit and then cleaning the commentary and answers that are now obsolete / not relating to the actual problem


Basically, it seems a community discussion of an open-ended "diagnosis" topic.

Undoubtly he has to try more than one tool to get the result he'd like to see, but that's too broad to answer


















It is not a answer to your specific question, just brainstorming:

I am "still" in favor of a pop up when asking a question, with some basic information to be filled in, ie model, OS, maybe some basic categories like, repair, improve, unknown error ect. that would help with many questions missing that. 

This would eliminate many questions from moderators attention for been vague.

In this case it would be not possible to ask a question spanning over the whole family of Apple products, that are usually open ended questions, since only one model can be entered.

Here is another example:



5 people looked and took the action of voting it down! even a moderator got involved to put it on hold?

Since the user only has 1 point anyway what does that do?

Having some sort of minimum to be filled out (as option) could prevent the fuss.

I do not know the solution, but seen the April joke in working, I wonder if same method could be used.

This will not eliminate the open field for asking questions, but will prevent the bad one.

Might make it easier to discuss furtherb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looking at the example you've added to the answer, how would entering a Mac model help here?

I’ve just proposed an answer to  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126687/which-macbook-screen-should-i-buy/126717Which MacBook screen should I buy? Because it seemed to me the underlying question went well before the scope of what the OP was asking, I took the liberty of writing the question https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126715/how-to-identify-which-model-is-my-mac/126716#126716How to identify which model is my Mac? (and proposing an answer to it).

My answer to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126687/which-macbook-screen-should-i-buy/126717Which MacBook screen should I buy? is thus little more (well, still more, but not much at all) than a link to the other question.

I think it's very hard to give a general rule here outside of: if your answer serves to address the question, it's a good thing to do. And in your specific case I believe that to be true. You've given the answer the user needs to move forward and solve their problem. I don't see any problem with this and wouldn't request to you avoid it.

There's a general dislike of links on the Stack Exchange network because they rot and you lose the answers, but in this case you're linking to another AD answer so no need to worry about rot.

this is my first visit here and my attempts to comment on a certain Siri post were halted by a prompt for registration. Upon meeting that requirement, my efforts were subsequently derailed by yet another prompt saying that said I needed 50 "reputation". It kind of reminds me of bronchitis... Ain't nobody got time for that. 

Now, is my opinion that the requirements for new users to participate in this forum are inane and exorbitant. I'm sure once I ask a few questions it will be smooth sailing, however, I can't muster up a single Apple questions so this question is my attempt to gain some reputation as well as share my opinion.

I understand that one need 15 reputation points to rate a comment up and 50 to even post a comment. This is most likely set in place to protect the integrity of the content, however, I don't think it's working...  One of your users asked if https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/118332/is-there-a-siri-on-mac-os-xSiri was available for Mac and they rated his question DOWN. Who does that? Where I come from, the only stupid question is the one not asked (and maybe this one).

As for myself, I am an engineer, Apple certified technician, computer store franchise owner, IOS dev and 3-time world karate champion. I didn't join to ask questions, but rather to help. Alas, if asking questions is how one gains "reputation", then you can expect questions like this from me. I'm just saying, I'm a seasoned pro. The multiple certifications on my wall is my "reputation". 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why can't I do anything on this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for your last point – doesn't it work like that in the Apple Forums? You need to help out in order to "get reputation" and level up. I feel like this is similar to what occurs on Stack Exchange. Much of what you described is characteristic of the whole SE network, as opposed to just of this site. That's just how Ask Different, StackOverflow, and sites on the SE network in general work


















You primarily gain reputation by answering questions. 

I did feel a little constrained when I first joined, but by answering a few easy questions I got above 50 rep in my first day of effort. Each up vote of a question or answer is worth 10 points. 

Rather than needing people to take exams or have certificates, the community gives reputation to those that put out useful content.

However, the other question of this user has been put on-hold for this off-topic reason.

AND as stated by dwightk, other SE only shows AD Meta....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Rob This is the difficulty of us debugging the code. I see different options as an elected diamond mod. Trusted users at 10k see more options than a 2k user which both in turn see more than an unregistered or low rep user. I have reached out to the community management team (SE employees) to assist us with determining if this is a code issue, a documentation issue or a bug that can be fixed on the configuration end.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Rob Custom close reasons are only shown if you vote to close. As you have less than 3k reputation, you are not able to vote to close and instead are flagging to close. Whilst this puts it in the queue, it doesn't vote for the closure and consequently you can't add a custom reason since it would serve no purpose anyway.

Having just surpassed 500 helpful flags (and got a wonderful gold badge!) I'm wondering how my accuracy in flagging is compared to the average user.

Where can I look for average percentages of declined to helpful flags for the various categories of flag?

In case numbers can't be disclosed, here is my current flagging history to allow for comments such as 'high'/'low':

Short Answer: You can't.

Long Answer: I'm afraid you can't ;)

Flags is like votes, you can see your own, we can't.  You have access to the raw data, and can compile stats from it, but there's no handy page, not even for a Mod, that will do it.

Was wondering if it would be helpful to moderators and to keep this site cleaner to do following.

On each negative Vote on the Question the Font gets reduced in gray scale color.

So for example on this one:



With 5 down votes the text should be barley visible ?

It is a shame the Spammer gets more that 30 minutes of promotion and advertisement without been able to do much until a moderator takes action.

UPDATE:

Statistical it happens more and more and as you can see 4 down votes and not one FLAG ? Means 4 users had to open the question and then all they did is downvote.



EDIT:

Well in conclusion let it just put this way

It is not acceptable in 21 century on a high profile and high traffic web site to have Spams just sitting there for a hour or more.

The current system 


  There is an automated system - it requires 6 flags and not votes see

"8 negative votes and not single Flag."* How do you know they didn't flag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, your -100 for posting spam shouldn't have come from your answer to the spam question in the screenshot in your question here — the question was spam-deleted but **balpha deleted your answer and didn't spam-delete it**, so that shouldn't have cost you 100 reputation. (can someone confirm?) Did you post another answer to a different spam post? Link?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dwightk Having a post deleted due to spam will cost you 100 reputation which is removed from a user in private (not shown publicly on the reputation history). This won't get put back when the question is removed.


















I do not think this is required.
The main issue is that people need to flag this as spam, down votes have no effect.
After 3 flags it will not be on the front page - so takes less effort by us that your suggestion
From meta stackexchnage https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/58035/136010answer

The spam flag is designed to eliminate posts with no relevant content and to penalize the authors:

3 flags (spam or offensive): post is banished from the front page.
6 flags (spam or offensive): post is locked, deleted, and the first revision owner loses 100 reputation.
1 flag from a moderator has the same effect as 6 flags from normal users: instant destruction.
Because a question with 6 flags is locked and deleted by the Community user, a 10k reputation user cannot undelete it.
Each flag carries an implicit downvote for calculating the post's score (it does not affect the user's reputation).

Questions with no or no upvoted answers (as the one referenced in the question) will get reinfected into the front page a few times automatically to get more attention. As no user is involved the user is shown as "community". 

Like many users, community has a profile page that explains what they like to do on the site. In this case, community is a robot that randomly pokes these questions:

You are always allowed to review pending suggested edits on your own posts. In this case, the user reviewed one of your edits to their question:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/59018https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/59018


The user will have received a notification like this in their inbox notifying them that their post has got a pending suggested edit:



Clicking this item in their inbox goes to the suggested edit queue where the suggested edit is shown in the same way that any other reviewer may review the edit. They may approve or reject the edit and have a binding vote similar to a diamond moderator's binding vote.

As shown in the review history, the user who reviewed it has the blue background on their username indicating that they are the post owner and therefore have the authority to have a binding vote on the suggested edit.



The suggested edit can still be reviewed by others in the meantime…


If the suggested edit is approved by someone with access to the suggested edit review queue before they have the chance to review it themselves, they receive a normal inbox notification informing them that their post has been edited. This is the same notification that a user receives if someone with >2k edits their post normally.


If the suggested edit is rejected before they review it, they do not receive any further notifications.


The user does not have access to the suggested edit queue outside of any pending suggested edits on their own posts. Once they have exhausted all the pending suggested edits they will be informed that the suggested edit queue requires 2k reputation — the same message a user without the reputation to review posts in the suggested edit queue and without any pending suggested edits.

Even though the user is the post owner and does not have access to the review queue, their approval or rejection of the suggested edit is still shown normally in the suggested edit review queue history, both in the suggested edit queue history (available at 10k)…



…and in the suggested edit history in the mod tools…

For some time now, I've had a retina avatar, but no longer.

I didn't change anything, but for apparently no reason my avatar is now very pixelated everywhere but my profile (and the top bar because it's scaled so small that it looks retina).

I've tried changing my avatar to my Gravatar and back to an uploaded image, and to an Identicon (I've never had a retina Identicon — some people do though) but none of these are retina.

I've just reached 20k and got the ability to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/trusted-uservote to delete posts that are -1 or below.
I don't understand the purpose of this, or how I should be using it.

Currently, when I see an answer by a new user that is NAA, I flag as such and add a comment explaining where they've gone wrong and what they should do instead. Then, once a moderator comes along, the flag is seen and the answer is deleted.

Now, according to the privileges page, I should vote to delete when…


  The answer doesn't attempt to answer the question; it may be a comment or a separate question altogether.


Therefore, as far as I know, I should be voting to delete such answers, which is fine. However, this means I have to downvote the answer — should I be doing this? I haven't been doing this before for new users' NAAs as I thought it'd put them off participating further, yet voting to delete requires the answer must be downvoted.

Also, should I be voting to delete instead of flagging as NAA, or as well as? Flags go into the flag queue which are immediately noticeable on the top bar, yet voting to delete goes to a relatively hidden part of the 10k tools. Do ♦︎ moderators see delete votes differently to how the 10k tools hides them?

Finally, taking a step back, what's the point of all this? There are currently 4 other users with 20k, one of which has binding votes anyway. It takes 3 delete votes to delete an answer, therefore it needs 3 of us to be online at some point, open the 10k tools, go to the pending deletion votes and take action, or https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/low-quality-posts/statsbe active in the Low Quality Post review queue all before one of the many excellent timely moderators swoops in and kills the post anyway.

I'll try to address what I see as the main thrust is that the Stack Exchange idea is that the community and not elected moderators should be able to handle the majority of the moderation.

Yes, the site had a period where we didn't have enough users to vote to close without a binding vote by a moderator (elected or employee). Now we're at the stage where that happens without a moderator needing to act. As the high rep user base grows, the deletion will also follow to be something that can happen without needing a flag or a moderator to cast a binding vote.

Looking at forest and not the trees - delete content that is so bad that you feel no normal user should even have to see it.

Posts that should be deletes are where the only content is:


offensive (racist, homophobic, juvenile, curse)
in no way on topic (astrology adverts, soccer match, handbag sales, etc...)
completely redundant and inferior to an existing answer/post


If you can remove the problem parts of a post by editing, that is the way to go and not deletion. Also, since the deletion tools put the items in the delete queue, it's probably better for you to use that instead of flagging since we know a high rep user can only cast a delete vote, but when we're processing NAA queues, it's more mixed in with anything that could be flagged.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So I should downvote so I can vote to delete, then vote to delete, rather than flagging as NAA/etc?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside Yes, I would say down vote / delete is the best and first option. If the post gets deleted within the window where votes get reversed, only the deletion will be permanent. Once you used the normal tools, you could flag it if it was so bad, a binding action by the people that handled the flag queue seems for the good of the site.


















If you vote to delete at 20k, I think it just deletes it as if you were a Mod (is this right?).  In my mind there is no need to down vote if you are deleting, but I would always comment why you are deleting, and where possible use a generic templates response that shows the OP what happened without it looking like you got personal.  Here's my default response, which OSX and iOS expands when I type "rnaa":

Hi, I removed this as it is not an answer to the question. Answers that are discussion/commentary/another question/me too/thanks etc are against the sites posting policy in order to maintain a focus on high quality answers.

Others use similar versions (If your vote isn't immediately binding, I could have that wrong, then adjust your language accordingly), it doesn't matter what but do try to include something to let the OP know.  Some of us tailor the response, but I find that can result in discussion, so I leave if for them to work out what's wrong with it - self education generally works better ;) :

"Your post is another question"

"No it isn't, it's just asking for clarification because my X is similar to his Y"

If you use this, don't double mod the post by flagging too.  This is flagging of a sort, just specialised.

As to the point?  Well, often the other sites that have a more rigorous Mod team involvement leave this sort of stuff to the high rep non mods to sort out, and only step in for the more serious offenders, luckily we don't really have any issues or at least enough of them often enough to make the Mods need to ring fence their time to operate on the worst cases, so we often dip into the normal review queues and hit stuff with the mod hammer before waiting for user vote accumulation, which as you say may take a while because we are also historically a low voting and hence low rep site.

Don't they go to a single accumulated queue?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside Odd - it seems I wouldn't ever vote to delete a post that I hadn't down vote. Could you explain how you find a post useful, yet still want it deleted? In the most basic sense, a down vote means "not useful" and a delete means "so unuseful that it's actually harmful" - shouldn't one be a subset of the other in almost all cases?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike If I should vote to delete instead of flag as NAA then for new users' NAAs e.g. 'Me too' I wouldn't really want to downvote — it might add extra information that should be a comment? I guess I'm still confused about all this…


















I was on the fence trying to figure out how to convert your post into an actual answer. Why not start with answering the question and let's leave aside why the other answerer is so wrong. 

I've undeleted your post since clearly you are interested in helping out. Let's work on getting you some reputation so you can comment constructively (telling someone their post is wrong is encouraged - especially when backed up with facts or at least an opinion that can be understood.)

Can you clean up the answer to be sure to address first the question at hand and then perhaps an aside as to why and how the other answer is not helpful.

If your post only is "me too", no matter how eloquent, it will get removed again since that's just not how the site works - high reputation or low reputation. Your best bet would be to ask a new question explaining you want to do surface mount soldering and ask for details. Then we could have a question for what most people do - go get a component level repair and what you seem to be seeking - how to repair a damaged/failed component.

Basically - the dealer might replace the engine in a car under warranty, but a car enthusiast might rebuild the engine of a car - especially when the engines are no longer being made.



Meta note - Thanks for asking - do realize that this is exactly how the sites are designed to work to start people on asking/answering and then only allowing comments once you've gotten the hang of each site. Also, this isn't a forum in the sense that there are no norms and rules - so please have a look at the https://apple.stackexchange.com/helpHelp Center which tries to explain how the system allows others to vote you the privilege of commenting in general.

It was only after a while that I decided to post about the rep problem, and I originally did it at Meta StackExchange as the implementation is across all Stack sites.  I will see what I can do with my post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nap if you want to reach out to us you can always [drop in to the chat channel for AD](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat).

Have to figure that one out, since I don't appear to be logged into it, yet I'm logged in here.

You're in the right place to ask this sort of thing here, much better than editing  similar questions into a deleted post which only you and the Moderators can see anyway.

The most basic answer is that your answer was deleted because it was not an answer, which you are already aware of.  As such it was flagged by another user of the site (actually it was flagged twice by different users) which brings it onto our review queue.  @bmike was merely the first person with the authority to handle the flag who saw it, and he removed it as per our posting guidelines, because answers that are commentary/discussion/me too/thanks/another question etc are not valid ones, and he indicated as such in a comment to explain why he removed it.  I just need to make sure you understand that an Admin didn't "just come along and remove it" for no reason, it went through our proper flag and review process, and I would have reached the same conclusion and removed it also.

Now, as for why you had to do it this way because of your low reputation score, that's another story.  I have to disagree with you when you say "It doesn't make sense and works against the boards intentions".  To my mind, it makes perfect sense, and that's only partly because I get to see everything that is posted, including all the stuff we have to remove regularly to keep the site on topics and used as it is meant to be used.  It takes https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesvery little effort to earn enough rep to be able to vote and comment, and you should really try to gain these privileges in order to then progress your own questions properly.  The privileges are earned in a way that allows you to contribute properly and to guide your contributions to ensure they are appropriate by not allowing your to, for example, engage in lengthy discussions in comments (Not saying you would have, but it happens, and when such stuff is then subsequently flagged, I can almost guarantee it's a low rep user who hasn't quite got it etc).  Making you earn your privileges avoids a lot of clean up required by the Moderators.

Now, finally as to the existing answer, and why it wasn't removed you just need to consider that when a contribution is flagged, there is no requirement for whichever of us volunteer Mods to then go and perform a full audit of the Question and all it's Answers that haven't been flagged.  It's there still because no-one has flagged it, because it's got votes, and because while it's not a solution to the OP, it is still a valid answer to my mind.  If you don;t think it is, you only need 15 rep to flag it to us in the same way your post was flagged, and we'll review it.  Please consider that this isn't a personal tech helpdesk service where we have to answer your question the way you want it in a "customer is always right" sort of scenario.  Everything on the site, from the moment it leaves your keyboard, is community owned and community edited and moderated.  While the answer might not be what the OP and yourself are looking for, if we feel it may well help other people in the future, we can leave it there.  The community will up and down vote and flag as appropriate to ensure that answers are useful overall, and very often a *"You can't do that" is appropriate.  In this particular scenario, while I imagine that a couple of people may have the skills to identify and solder individual components onto a motherboard without damaging it, I imagine there are also a lot more people who would appreciate being told that this is the only way and the replacement at a part level is maybe a better solution for those of us without mad skills with the flux.

Anyway, I hope this explains the general reasoning behind why what was removed was removed, and why what is still there is still there.  Please just take the time to look around for a couple of questions to answer.  Just 2 upvotes will give you more rep to do more things on the site.

I edited the deleted post as it was the only way I could say something about what happened.  This is not the only stack exchange where I participate, and whilst I don't have a lot of rep, I have enough rep at StackOverflow (which perhaps could have been carried across with my other account credentials when I joined this board) to post comments and more. I understand how the game is played.  I have a broken computer next to me which I would like to fix. And I do know how to solder, and there are a lot of hobbyists around.

It's taken me a long time to get to that, over a year.  I only speak when I have something to add, and I spend a lot of time researching my problems before I post a question, which doesn't leave many questions to post.  So, not being a chatterbox works against me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nap you can now post an answer to your own question when  you post the question, adding to the zeitgest and knowledge base -- so even you don't need an answer, consider adding your knowledge! You get rep for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IC..  Not the same as helping someone out though.  But I'll keep that in mind.


















Sometimes Community (diamond) bumps questions which not have had an accepted answer to the top of the questions queue. However, some questions of these are over 2 or 3 years old. 

Sometimes I'm close to putting a comment to an answer/a question and then see last second before posting it, the answer was about 2-3 years ago (and so was the question).
The comment is irrelevant at that point because example now; someone was explaining Windows XP in bootcamp, which isn't supported for a long time anymore (at least since OS X 10.6)

Could it be an option to display the date (on the bottom of a question and answer) in red if the date is 2 or more years old?

The name "AskDifferent" is downright confusing and not useful.

Change it to something more useful like:

AskApple

AskOSX

AskiOS

AskMac

AppleExchange

MacExchange

etc.

If the site is to remain about anything-apple, then I like AppleExchange. However, I feel the different devices/os's are different enough to warrant their own exchanges. I would like to see them broke out into an iOS exchange, and a Mac/OSX exchange.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Change exchange Name to be more Descriptiveb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/205/official-site-title/207#207b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1345/rename-the-site-as-apple-user/1635#1635b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286/ask-different-really-surely-ask-apple


















Anyone with a little bit of Apple history knows that it is  merely an allusion to the Think Different marketing campaigns that Apple used to run.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_differenthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different


  "Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.
  
  The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have
  no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them,
  glorify or vilify them.
  
  But the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change
  things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They
  create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.
  
  Maybe they have to be crazy.
  
  How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or
  sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a
  red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
  
  We make tools for these kinds of people.
  
  While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the
  people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are
  the ones who do."




Any choice of name would be down to personal opinion and preference, but I think it's far better than any of your suggestions which are all too narrow in there descriptive ability  other than AskApple, which has trademark and copyright issues. Using "exchange" brings to mind Microsoft, to me.  As you can see, logos and slogans etc have to be chosen very carefully.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's 97-2002 actually, or early modern era Apple. I never had an Apple device until 2007, and it still works for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It even works for my kids (born in the late 1990s) :-)


















One could say the name "Apple" is downright confusing and not useful — it's a fruit, and it doesn't suggest the products they actually sell. But it's the name of the company.  Similarly, Ask Different is the name of this community. Names aren't descriptions; they're identifiers.

I'm troubled, though, that you would wander into a community and, without getting to know anyone or participating in the community, tell us that we need to change our name. If someone took a plane to New York and, upon arriving, started asking people to rename the city to something else, they would rightly be laughed out of town. This community was named by its participants early in its history. There were indeed discussions at that point about what an appropriate name for the community was (and we were originally called apple.stackexchange.com). But proposals for something as drastic as renaming a community really should only come from people who are deeply involved in the life of that community. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question is part of an overall campaign to help clean up stackexchange. There has been a lot of new exchanges cropping up, and unfortunately they are not of the same quality the original exchanges strived to be. Many are primarily opinion-based such as The Workplace, and this has been acknowledged by some of the community leaders. Changing this exchange name would only help the community - not every Apple device user knows about an old marketing campaign - nor is it descriptive to a casual passer-by. Splitting into multiple exchanges would help focus questions and answers, better for allb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't fix things which ain't broken. If you really think SE as a whole need to be cleaned up, take it to http://meta.stackexchange.com for discussionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix I have, and was directed to post these sort of things on each of the exchanges by the mods there. my only mistake was I could not locate the meta for this site for my OP. I feel very strongly that all of the different apple devices should not be blanketed under one exchange. it's too broad. OSX issues have nothing to do with iPhone charging problems, etc. At the least, there should be an Apple Software, and an Apple Hardware exchange...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why "should" there be different sites in your opinion? Which existing/observable problems would this solve?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix I think it's more beneficial to split at the very least, devices and operating system's. For example, replacing the screen on an iDevice is not similar or related to fixing a broken Parallels install due to an update. It would help focus each of the exchanges. In Apple's world, the devices/hardware are unique enough to warrant their own exchange and not be lumped into a general "pc hardware" exchange, I can give you that. As this exchange grows (it will), keeping it focused will benefit all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix also, my personal opinion is the current name is a giant advertisement for Apple, and is also slightly esoteric and brings a certain, "air" to the exchange if you catch my meaning. It should either be named for what it is "Ask Apple" (we already have AskUbuntu with no trademark issues, just don't use the Registered logo and you are safe), or should be named more descriptive like "Ask About Apple Products" (admittedly not as sexy). A googler should not have to be already familiar with this exchange to understand it's an authoritative site for answers about their apple product(s).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you want to edit your question (or raise a new one on meta) to elaborate your reasoning a bit more? Please also take the time to understand how the site currently works, how tags are used to separate questions by various topics and how (in a HW/SW split) questions like "My iPhone Home button is broken, is there a HW or SW solution to fix it?" would be handled.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Answer for your Apple questions" is actually written below AskDifferent, so I don't see your point here. People don't just stumble over this site after all, they mostly come in via Google/other search engines or via links shared on other sites. So in a way the name doesn't matter at all.


















I'm all in favor of killing it (and adding a requirement that new tags can only be created by people with >15k rep), but my main concern about killing off tags is the bump to the top of the queue of all the edited posts. I'm utterly convinced that we're better off without that tag, though.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we manually edit a post to remove a tag, it gets a bump.  If the tag is removed, or renamed, does the resultant bump actually happen?  I'm not sure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with killing it but the rep requirement for new tags is much too high even if there should be one - should be around a few hundred if any. We just need to review new tags more quickly there aren't manyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark The current requirement is [300 rep for new tags](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tags). IMO this is fine since there are so many new tags that it goes past the 10k tools list.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside I agree that rep level that seems reasonableb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any progress on this? I would retag manually but the questions seem appropriately tagged otherwise —cc @stuffeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We need an answer on bumping.  If binning a tag doesn't bump, then I say bin it.  If it does, then it's worth ignoring on the basis it's just untidy, but not a real problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GeorgeGarside as far as I know, no, we can't do that.


















The comment has been deleted after your message was sent and before you got a chance to check it out.  The system isn't clever enough to recall or cancel the message, so it sends you to where is was, even if it's gone.

26 is what is left after the bounty.  A bounty is removed from your rep the moment you offer it, not when you award it to an answer.  You lose that rep even if you don't then offer it to anyone.

Look for an official launch blog post next week if no show stoppers are found, however, you can download the Stack Exchange app now from the App Store.

[I thought of posting this as an answer, but realized it might be flagged as "not an answer" and removed :P ]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Meta has a long standing announcement function, plus the discussion tag is for pure discussion that in any way relates to the site. Is the concept of discussion on meta really unclear to you?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't visit meta regularly like I do the main site. So I wasn't aware of the announcement mode. Nevertheless, the usage of a Q&A format to announce things (where upvotes/downvotes don't really make sense) seems like the right tool is not available/used. The "What's Meta" (http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-meta) page does not mention making community announcements either. And a discussion tag, as that page says, is "for posts that may not have a clear-cut right or wrong answer and are often subjective".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tradition and long standing usage aside, I feel that a blog (or a proper bulletin board) would be the right place to post or share announcements and invite comments. In my opinion, announcements would be better shared at http://apple.blogoverflow.com/ (where, incidentally, the last post is dated November 2012).


















However sometimes the question and the problem describe show that the OP does not know how to ask the right question based on the problem. 

I would say that in those case it is OK to answer the question based on the problem described rather then on the question asked.

Or alternatively use Edit to improve the question asked. I tend to avoid doing that since some OP are sensitive to changing they question to that degree (that is not what I have asked ect..). To avoid that kind of conflicts I just give the answer based on the actual problem described even if it does not fit the question asked.

Mostly those problems are in the Title of the Question.

This is what I do based on what I've seen other more experienced users do, including yourself :)

If a question is vague based on how it's written, I'll usually edit it, with a comment such as:

I've edited your question in an attempt to clarify a few details regarding [type here] — please edit further to extenuate any details and further clarify the problem.


If a question is vague because it's missing essential details, I'll usually write a comment myself from scratch explaining what's missing then vote to close as unclear.

However, there are some questions that need a general assistance in being written. If I think a link to the How to Ask page would be useful, I'll comment the following, then VTC:

Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking. See the [ask] page for help clarifying this question.

This is usually prepended automatically with 'Welcome to Ask Different!' as the user is usually new in this case. ARC is a wonderful thing :) If anyone's interested, here's my http://georgegarside.com/o/se/arc.htmlcomments that I use for reviewing posts on Stack Exchange.

This isn't really a case like the others above and doesn't happen often, but something that can make a question unclear: a title and body that doesn't match. If the body is longer than the title, I usually edit the title to match the body, adding the following comment when I do so:

Your title and body seemed contradictory, showing two different problems. I've edited the title to fit the body, but feel free to re-edit and clarify the situation.

I am more reluctant to change a body to match a title.


In summation, I believe the above works generally well and although some data would be helpful here, it seems that…

in the first case the question usually gets a suitable answer, either from myself or from someone else,
in the second case the OP either edits before the question gets closed and so avoids closure or edits after closure and is reopened either by someone seeing the question or from the Reopen queue,
in the third case the user either edits their question or never comes back and the question gets auto deleted, and
in the fourth case, nothing else really happens and people carry on as if the title had been written originally.

In rare cases, I'll sometimes do one of the above and also answer myself based on educated guesses. This is either approved by the OP and I edit the original question based on the information that I've presumed, or is declined by the OP and lets them see exactly how their question could be perceived, which is generally different to how they believe they've portrayed their problem and is the reason for the lack of clarity.

The exact algorithm used to denote whether a post is low quality has not been released publicly to prevent gaming the system.

However, from the little information released on Meta.SE, it seems each post is given a score based on its content. Good things increase the score and bad things decrease it. The old 10k tools used to show this raw score directly, however as the 10k flags have been obliterated, it's no longer possible to see (except diamond mods).

With the above answer, I'd hypothesise that it was just on the boundary, with titles that didn't start with capitals, multiple links and 'advertising' of a 30 day trial.

Can we change the chat to be accessible for writing at +5 rep for AskDifferent? If it's based on a "permanent" number, could SE maybe update this so it's variable for each different site?

I think it's enough to have +5 on AskDifferent as we have awesome mods who will delete a user if he starts spamming our AskDifferent chatroom.

First to note StackExchange works by everyone uses the same rules - so down vote is the only way to show that a question or answer is not good. This question is better asked on a meta site which talks about how StackExchange works (This question will probably me moved to AskDifferent's http://meta.apple.stackexchange.commeta site). On these sites a down vote means that a person disagrees with the question. All information is public and direct conversation to a user is not supported.

Android Enthusiasts is not for Android developers from the site's https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp centre 


  Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange is for enthusiasts, power users, and regular people who use the Android operating system.


Development code issues are off topic it seems and should ono be on http://stackoverflow.comStackOverflow (there is a heavily used android tag)

For iOS devices this site AskDifferent is the equivalent to Android Enthusiasts although we also cover other Apple devices and software. Like the Android site development and especially Objective C issues are off topic here and should be asked on http://stackoverflow.comStackOverflow

To see what sites Stack Exchange has either look at the bottom of every page or the drop down box at the top left found by clicking on Stack Exchange there.

I think like stackoverflow, here also i can't accept two answers together as an "Accepted Answer" isn't it?


















Welcome to the site!  I'll try to answer your questions.

OK, you have a little misunderstanding about the nature of Stack Exchange sites.  Stack Overflow was the first and original site, and then Stack Exchange was setup to create further sites along different topics.  These days there are SE sites for everything from coding to parenting via philosophy and bicycling.  You can see a http://stackexchange.com/sitesfull list here.

We don't have groups, as such, but each sub-site (usually called sitename.stackexchange.com e.g. apple.stackexchange.com but sometimes with their own redirecting URL such as askdifferent.com for our site etc) is essentially a wholly seperate entity, with their own topics and their own rules for what is on-topic etc.  Clearly asking about nappies on a Ubuntu site is not appropriate! ;)

What can link them, is you - your user account can be linked to many such sites, you have a profile on each site, and nominate one (usually your first) to be your parent profile under which all others are linked.

When you do this, if your reputation score on one SE site is sufficient, you can a 100 association bonus, the purpose of this is to remove the early privilege limitations whereby you need to earn reputation in order to do more than the basics - as the message says when you are awarded the bonus, you are trusted to know how to use an SE site, and don't need to prove that again.  The reputation is added to the profile in the site you just joined, purely to remove the new user restrictions - you can't add it to your rep from another site.  Overall, it is calculated in your total rep across all sites, but you cannot, for example, join 50 sites and get a 5000 bonus on your primary profile...

Now, as for Objective-C programming, the main coding site is still Stack Overflow.  There is an Apple group, as you have found, but programming in anything other than user facing utilities like Automator, AppleScript, and a bit of Terminal is off topic here.  Likewise, a similar restriction applies to the Android site.

The Stack Overflow site is the primary source for all programming questions, regardless of your platform or language of choice.  You can filter by tags to ensure you only see questions which are appropriately tagged with Objective-C or Xcode etc, but they are still all included in the same site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5♦, Thanks a lot for your clear explanation in details about this matter. Now it make sense to me. But, when previously i linked my primary profile (Stackoverflow) with "Stackexchange", i was got `100` Bonus "Associate Reputation" in **Both profile** (Stackoverflow & Stackexchange). Here according to the post topic (Android Enthusiasts), a person get `100` reputation in his/her both profile too. So, what's the reason here, to give a person's primary profile (Stackoverflow) 100 Bonus?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tulon if you have a certain rep in one site then you will get the association bonus in any new site you join see http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/141649/136010b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that it is the same 100 shown twice.  Because you joined a new site, you get 100 *in that particular site*.  But that 100 is also shown on your *network* profile, which will be linked to SO which you joined first.  It's not 200, it;s 100 being shown twice.  I think!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark, @ stuffe♦,
Yes, i got it. Thanks again to both of you. Ahh, i love "Stackoverflow and all others SE sites. :)


















Migrated questions leave a trail. It's been like that as long as I can remember.

Take https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/131467/missing-a-lot-of-options-from-finders-right-click-context-menuthis question for example. It's a good question, but there's no definitive answer without going through some of the initial troubleshooting steps I point out in my comments in order to isolate the problem. 

We are encouraged only to answer questions in our replies, rather than respond with speculations as to the problem - but in this case, and in many cases, isolating the problem using the comment section is crucial to actually delivering an answer. Should there not be a "reward?"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why don't "up-votes" received for a comment contribute to reputation scores?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For this specific question one option you have is to go back and add an answer based on the comments to offer all troubleshooting tips together.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If this is a feature request, can you make it more like a feature request? I.e. rather than asking why they don't provide reputation, say why you think they *should* provide reputation. I've removed the feature-request tag for now. Also, see this Meta.SE post: [Reputation for comments?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/296/reputation-for-comments)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside perfectly reasonable. i've marked as answered. **stuffe's** response was on point, and **patrix** made a great point about answering the question after the fact. Thanks.


















Because comments are transitory, and should be used to indicate clarification etc. An upvote on a comment is further evidence to the OP that it's a good one that may allow them to amend their question/answer.  If that results in an improvement etc, then the vote should be applied to the question/answer (if that's not already been done), not the comment, which should then be removed.

Essentially, comments are post it notes.  In the ideal world, they all get binned once they have served their purpose to further the efforts to improve a contribution.  Comments can spill over into chat if too many are created, and as such it's just like starring a chat comment - it signifies it adds something, but it isn't a formal part of the q or a.

On extremely busy posts, votes push up the best comments while the rest are hidden from view, so votes on comments aren't in the same rep giving class as actual posts. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also worth noting that you cannot downvote a comment, just like you can't dislike a comment on Facebook, or anti-favourite a tweet etc.  Think of up votes on comments more as *likes* or *favourites*, just a little something to let the poster know it was well received without people competing to get rep through them which would probably result in an increase of crap ones

Ask Different doesn't seem to migrate many questions anywhere very often; in the last 90 days, 7 questions were migrated to SO and 1 to SU (and 6 to the child meta).


  Migration paths are only created when there is a history of many good migrations having happened between site A and site B.


Source: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/817/Can we have StackOverflow added as a site we can migrate questions to

There hasn't been a migration to UX in the last 90 days (I can't go back further in time, but I don't recall any others that have been migrated).

You can always flag for a moderator to migrate it though:


  you can flag a post for moderator attention and a moderator can migrate it to any SE site if it needs to be moved


Source: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/267/Closing question as should be on other SE site



With regard to the specific post in question, I saw your off-topic flag and voted to close the question with a custom reason (which you can do at 3k)—you can see the reason that I gave as it is added as a comment: I mentioned UX as a possible destination to the question. If the question is closed, the user is free to ask the question on UX anyway, if they wish, or request that the question be migrated themselves by flagging their own question.

In this case, as your off-topic flag doesn't 'count' it doesn't really matter which reason you give, as the reason for the closure (shown in the blue post notice) will be determined by those who actually vote to close the post (whether that be 5 users or a ♦ moderator) rather than those who have flagged as off-topic. Your flag simply brings it to the attention of other users who have greater than 3k reputation. When you reach 3k, you will be able to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questionscast your own votes to close questions (and also view the https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/close/Close Votes review queue). You will then be able to write a custom reason in the free-form off-topic box which can be used as the actual reason for the closure:

It's overly broad and asks too many questions rather than showing research and asking for specific advice.


















The OP has to award the bounty, and it is not linked to acceptance. It's a separate process, and it's entirely possible to award it to an unrelated answer.

Because they are not linked, the OP will instead be told when it has expired that he has a couple of days to award it, and will get bugged to do so. I think if the OP does not specifically award it, it can be auto awarded to the highest scoring answer if it's above a certain level, I don't recall the exact mechanism.

Check the question, if the bounty is still active, then just have patience until it's expired and the OP gets prompted.

The asker of the question decides whether and to whom to assign the "accepted answer" checkbox. The issuer of a bounty decides whether and to whom to assign the bounty. These are separate decisions, even in the case where the asker and the poster of the bounty are the same person. In this case, the poster actually left a note:

"Update 2: The bounty and the accepted answer are both great - couldn't decide so I split the accept and the bounty between them."

Looking in the Answer with Bounty, I find it very week.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You may well disagree, but it's not your call, nor mine. The one who pays the piper calls the tune. If you want to agree with some bounty awards, hand them out yourself.


















Maliciously wrong answers, which do something unexpected and harmful to the user, should be flag-worthy.

For example, if someone asked:


  How do I change the permissions of a directory?


Then the following answer should be flag-worthy, because it does something unexpected and harmful:


  Do rm -rf directory


By contrast, the following is incorrect (the command name is mis-spelt), but wouldn't be flag-worthy:


  Use the changemod command


I recently flagged an https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/68906/691answer as maliciously wrong, but was declined for doing so.

It said:


  You just click on the red maximize button


The red button doesn't maximize a window, but closes it instead, which is unexpected and harmful behaviour.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maliciously wrong answers should be flag-worthyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could you provide a link to the post in question or the edit? Often a comment explaining the danger is better than asking moderators to censor or even be able to judge what is malicious. Some things like an operation or terminal command is fine in the hands of an expert, yet prone to disaster in someone not aware of the power being wielded.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Done, thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I think this should definitely be something flagable!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this case, editing the post to change the word "red" to "green" would fix the problem. If it was a mistake on the part of the poster, they will appreciate the fix and readers benefit also. If they roll back your edits, that starts to look like evidence of  malicious intent.


















Thanks for raising the issue.

I examined the account and the post. I don't think it's overly malicious - especially with a slightly more verbose comment (I edited yours to show you what I mean).


  This answer is potentially maliciously wrong. Pressing the red button will close the window or application and in some cases, you could lose data if the app doesn't save periodically or restore it's state when you re-launch it.     


But, the answer is just noise, so a low quality flag would be sufficient to get that post deleted. It's cleaned up now - again thanks for raising this on meta -the perfect venue for this sort of discussion and clean-up.

That's right , something to strive for...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also cleared the flag -- didn't think it was overly malicious.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, there can be a whole world of difference between the same answer depending on if the *intention* was malicious, or if it was just borne from stupidity, ignorance or even a simple typo.  In your example, I think the OP likely meant green not red, but had a brainfart - In this instance simply editing the content to make it correct where there was an obvious fault easily corrected might be best.


















I have been seeing questions about the Swift programming language here and on StackOverflow, and other technologies that are currently under NDA. Should these be flagged or closed since Swift falls under the Apple Developer NDA?

If so, what category should be used for the reason?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should questions about the Swift Programming Language be dealt with?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apple has a free ebook in iBooks on the swift language without NDA.


















No - we don't really enforce NDA directly so that's generally not a good reason to flag anything. Also, as Daniel explained in a comment - the language itself is documented publicly in an iBook without any NDA required to learn the syntax. Similarly, all of Cocoa with the exception of pre-release API and changes are all available on http://developer.apple.comhttp://developer.apple.com with no NDA or account needed to learn / discuss / use Cocoa API.

All the swift questions I've seen so far are clearly code level programming questions and/or vague requests for classes / books and those aren't really on topic here or SO per both site's help center guidelines. So, I'd say the generic programming close reason is how you might handle most Swift questions in the future.

If you want to suggest some specific questions to discuss the proper close reasons, we can add them as comments here or an edit to your question, but there's little to discuss here until Xcode itself is generally released as it's unlikely Swift will be on topic here any more than Objective-C and C++ and Ruby are today.

If it turns out that Swift is actually some form of scripting, then we would probable allow those questions once some version of the language ships on an OS or Xcode that's available to anyone that chooses to download it. At present, I'm only aware of Xcode for developers which is both NDA + Pre-Release with the Pre-Release being the primary reason it's OT here today as opposed to the NDA directly.

I wouldn't even migrate though, at present, just close with a custom message suggesting to use the Dev forums which they have paid for instead, as that is *clearly* the appropriate audience.


















I've just typed an answer on AD and it's way slower than typing a question or answer on this meta for example.

Yes ofc your questions are valid


















I've seen a default "Not about Apple products and not in scope of this site etc." as closing reason.
It does not show up in my options, is it diamond mod only?

Can this be added to the 3k rep closing vote?

I've always wondered what the proper way to go about this is.

I posted a question on both Apple Support Communities and Ask Different. I got a response on the Support Communities first and it solved my problem.  Is it right for me to go ahead and put the solution to my problem in the Ask Different question?  For some reason I feed wrong doing it.

From https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/self-answerthe FAQ:


  Yes! Stack Exchange has always explicitly encouraged users to answer their own questions. If you have a question that you already know the answer to, and you would like to document that knowledge in public so that others (including yourself) can find it later, it's perfectly okay to ask and answer your own question on a Stack Exchange site.


So please go ahead and fill in an answer with a solution that works. There's a grace period before your own answer becomes something you can accept but otherwise it's a-okay.

How many times have I seen questions such as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/135461/characters-do-not-echo-in-os-x-terminal-unless-i-hit-the-delete-key#135469this in my few months participating in the community? Too many times. 

I brought up a https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2130/why-dont-up-votes-received-for-a-comment-contribute-to-reputation-scoressimilar issue on meta before, regarding the value of comments leading to solutions vs. speculative answers in replying to a question. 

In a way, it's the nature of the beast. We are, after all, not asking about http://english.stackexchange.comEnglish Language & Usage, but asking......."differently:" outside of the box. 

By the same token, it's a plague. 

I believe there is a fundamental dilemma with Ask Different's moderation system (note, I mean 'moderation' in a broader sense - not in regards to the current mods., whom I find excellent). 

The fundamental issue is that too many questions require clarification and more detail on behalf of the OP.

As a growing SE site, part of me believes it's not appropriate to place more stringent requirements on questions. Naturally, participants will be less inclined to participate in this community if they are even hesitant to ask a question. Membership and participation is paramount. 

The other half of me feels constant frustration when reading through some (most) questions, which require more work to clarify a question than to eventually provide its solution. To boot, I believe this has brought about a culture of speculative and often innacurate answers-even from notable, experienced members. This, in my opinion, is detrimental to the community as a whole. 

I joined Ask Different, partly, because I was sick of the continuously mundane questions (along with close minded 'fan-boy' ideology) over at https://discussions.apple.com/backsoon/discussionstempaway.htmlApple Support Communities that could be answered with a simple Command+C of my previous responses.

1) Do you agree there is an issue?

2) If so, who does the burden fall on?

3) What steps can (or should) be taken to ameliorate the issue?

Interesting post.  I think we have covered it a few times before, but I don't feel like hunting for duplicates, I think engaging users in fresh conversation on such topics in Meta is more important than pointing them to what has been said before.  Not like this place is high enough traffic to worry about the odd duplicate.

I won't answer your 3 questions directly (well; yes, everyone, not many) but rather discuss a few things about this site which might well result in a few insights why I genuinely think that Ask Different really is different from most of the other SE sites.

Let's go to other sites first.  Here, for example are a list of a few other other sites I use; Bicycles, Arqade, Science Fiction & Fantasy.  I use those sites differently to how I use this one (even before I was a Mod too) - those sites are centred about topics for which the majority of users share not just a common interest, but a common passion.  For many of the other more IT related sites (Ubuntu, Super-User) those people too are there not just because they have a problem, but because they have a passion for their subjects, or in the least for the technical IT sites are at least skilled and knowledgeable enough to be able to participate.

Now, with Ask Different, things are different.  We don't have such a well defined audience of people (either passionate or highly skilled).  A lot of our users are here not out of a passion for Apple, but out of frustration due to not being able to do something as a normal everyday person.  And that something is such a wide remit.  We are here to discuss "Apple", the company and anything it's name can be loosely associated with.  And these days, that covers so much stuff:

Hardware:


Desktops


Servers
All-in-ones

Laptops
Monitors
Tablets
Phones
iPods (from nano to Classic via Touch)
Headphones
Peripherals, Mice, Keyboards etc
Routers
Backup Systems (Time Capsules)
Accessories, from covers to cases to docks etc
Apple TVs


And these are just the first party hardware topics  Imagine if I bothered to create a list of the software topics, everything from Apple Script to ZFS...

This is the key, our focus is so overly broad that while we can and do have a core membership of highly skilled, experienced, and generally perceptive users, our core membership consists of people that bought something in a shop and can't get it to do what they want.  And basically, most Apple stuff these days is by and large a commodity product.

It's the difference between having a site revolving about engine tuning and performance upgrading etc, and one for "Ford".  We are guaranteed to get the dumber questions, the ill-informed users, the poorly thought out content.  It's just the nature of the massively wide audience we have.  Other sites take the cream off the top of their particular areas of interest, and gather them together to form a community.  We simply take in randoms off the street, people who aren't here to stay here, but people who want to get in, get help, and get out.

Now is this a problem?  Yes in many ways, I doo feel our participation levels and community feel seems lesser than many of the other sites we use

Who's burden is it?  Well, it's everyone's, but being practical it's really (and unfairly) on the Mods, the High Level users, the Long Term users to try to corral everything into something like quality content, and we simply don't have enough of those as a percentage of all users like other sites do.

What can we do?  Keep calm, and carry on.

As an aside, the first link you direct us to about the Terminal problem, I think is actually a good question.  It's a genuine problem, well described with enough info to ensure it get's a proper answer.  And I suspect that is where some of the frustration behind your question comes from (good frustration, expressed properly, not having a go here).  You and I probably know where to look or how to have a quick Google to fix that in seconds.  You're obviously a skilled and experience IT guy.  But the OP?  Chances are he's a guy who bought an iMac after loving his iPhone, has played about in Terminal so see what it is and such, maybe fiddled with settings, and now has gotten stuck.  He's just a guy off the street with an IT problem.  He's not an IT guy on an IT site participating in an IT community.

It's a tough one, and hits at the heart of the biggest problem with this site.  I don't see a fix.

I wasn't clear in posting my original question - I do actually feel that many of these posts *are* actually good questions (as the Terminal Q I linked to), but just need to be refined; in fact, it's usually the good Q's that require a bit more detail to get to the bottom of :) ...Thanks again for your thoughts and wisdom. Cheers.


















There is a little yet annoying bug in the site.

I am writing a (big) answer.

In the text area, I have the view at the top. The cursor is at the end.

With the handle, I make the text area taller.

Expected behaviour :  The text area gets taller. And that’s it.

Actual behaviour :  The text area gets taller. But the view jumps to the end of the text area.

There is also a variant of the bug :

In the text area, I have the view at the end. The cursor is at the beginning.

With the handle, I make the text area taller.

Expected behaviour :  The text area gets taller. And that’s it.

Actual behaviour :  The text area gets taller. But the view jumps to the beginning of the text area.

End of the variant.

The native resize handle of Safari for text areas does not have this bug. This bug is especially annoying, because the text areas of the site do not have the native resize handle of Safari — the site overrides it.

The bug also occurs when I am writing a question.

It would be nice to fix this bug. Thank you.

I have Safari 7 Mac.

I encountered this question via an organic search result in Google. Can a mod please unlock it so that I can upvote it? 

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16759/how-can-i-make-safari-show-the-url-when-i-hover-over-a-linkHow can I make Safari show the URL when I hover over a link?

The question has been locked for 7 months, and the system doesn't trust me that my upvote would be not genuine. A user's combined reputation should be a good indicator that they're not messing around.

This leads to a feature request: provide the mods an option to expire the lock after n days.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unlock this question, please.

Rare occasion. I actually have two questions about Apple products and it complains

What gives?

I don't quite understand the rationale whichever way I think about it. Even if this is something to deter spammers, am I expected to turn into a spammer on an individual SE site suddenly, although having gained rep on several others already?

To add insult to injury I was handed a CAPTCHA on the last attempt. Perhaps because I kept retrying to post the question? Although, I kept retrying because there is no indication of when the 20 minutes are through?! ;)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"You can only post once every 20 minutes."?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it helps, I get CAPTCHAs now and then as well, especially while moderating a lot of flagged posts in a short time :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - CAPTCHA's are actually more necessary for high rep users as opposed to low rep users. Imagine the mess that could be caused if a cookie from a moderator were used by a bot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike: yes, this is a fact I didn't consider. But that's only the CAPTCHAs and not the posting of questions. Thanks nevertheless for pointing it out. Much appreciated.


















It's considered to be a feature, see https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=20+minuteshttps://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=20+minutes for quite a lot of information about this. 

The error message should have explained that this limitation is lifted for users with reputation above 125. If that notice wasn't provided, please indicate that and we'll turn this into a bug report.

This behavior is documented at:

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/65423/why-are-low-rep-users-rate-limited-when-posting-questionsWhy are low-rep users rate-limited when posting questions?

The rational for implementing this feature is covered in this blog post. I think SE is a bit proud that most people don't see the crap that gets posted (or wants to be posted by spammers / scammers / disruptive people) on the sites.

You should have the option to rollback any edits done to your posts in the revision history (the link you've included above). In your case, just click on the "rollback" label on version 2.

Personally I would recommend against doing that though.


















I'm thinking along the lines of http://www.quora.com/Thanks-Quora-featurewhat Quora does.



For two reasons:


Out of common decency. If someone edits the content of my post so that it substantively improves my answer, I'd like to just say thanks. 
So those who do so can be recognized somehow for providing excellent edits. 




Notes: 

Since editing badges just reflect volume of edits, I'm not sure (2) is satisfied to the same extent as an explicit thank you. 

With that said (1) is my primary focus in this request. - it's not a "why edit?" question - what I'm asking, simple and trivial as it may be, boils down to: "why can't I thank you for doing so?"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why not incorporate a "thank you" button for helpful edits to your post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could you document what you like about quota's implementation? It seems to behind some log in wall to actually read the link you posted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I signed out and tried the same link again and it still resolves - odd. At any rate, I've added a screenshot for clarity's sake. Thanks.


















For sub-2000 rep users I'll argue that the "thank you" comes by way of the edit being approved.

You have to remember that, under the terms and conditions of the site, you assign ownership of the answer to the community when you submit. It's not really "your answer" any more, it's the community's answer, so you personally thanking someone for the edit is not really important to the idea that is StackExchange.

In the case of https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit+2k rep members who don't require approval for edits, I'd hope that they understand the way the whole Stack Exchange model works well enough to not seek "thank you" notices for their edits.

You edit because it makes the world a better place, not because someone will thank you for that edit.

Your second request is covered by the Editor, Strunk & White and Copy Editor badges. Approved edits are counted and used to earn those badges. Badges represent excellence in editing (to some degree).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your input. I agree with the philosophy of the community and your personal sentiments as well. I also agree with the sub 2k argument. My original intention may not have been clear - it's not a question of "Why edit?", but rather just a feature, I feel, would be nice regardless of the motivations of the editor for performing those edits. *Nice* is not the same as *useful* though, which I understand. In the grand scheme, it's trivial, but what prompted me to ask this is a particular member (one of you mods, actually :) ) has provided crucial edits to a few of my answers as of late.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@njboot I'm curious to see what the SE devs have to say about the request. My opinion on the matter is, of course, my own and probably not shared by StackExchange. :)


















How to format reserved words within:


question title,
question body,
comments?


By 'reserved words' I mean words which aren't code and which
don't require to be emphasised but to be identified clearly as non common names. Here are a few examples of such words:


application names:

Grab, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, Preview, Terminal…
reserved directory:

Applications, Library, System…
menu entries:

File > Save…
OS names:

Lion, Mavericks, Ubuntu…




My personnal choice I tested for many months is to use backticks which are reserved for code.

Is this an acceptable practice?

Is it worth pursuing a feature request to introduce another mark to markup these reserved words?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Markup of reserved words?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've removed the feature request tag and wording to get some discussion going first. The best practice for a feature request is to make a concrete request rather than open discussion. What do you think of waiting on that until something concrete is ready to hit up the developers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, thank you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you give a reason why they need to highlighted - they are already emphasised by using a capital letter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Relevant to discussion: [List of Supported HTML Tags](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1777/what-html-tags-are-allowed-on-stack-exchange-sites)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5→ Mark: I would like to disambiguate the use of the word `for` as used in C from the same word "for" used in usual english and from the name of a colleague "For".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is still not a readable use - in the for case see programming books They just use English plain textb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No they don't. Most of the time scientific books use `cmr` or `Courier`.


















Code formatting for things that are not code is incorrect use of formatting and I edit posts to remove it regularly. Code formatting is https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135112/inline-code-spans-should-not-be-used-for-emphasis-rightnever a form of emphasis. Using code formatting for things that are not code…


makes the text very hard to read (https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/137755/reject-an-already-approved-suggested-edit-when-rolling-it-back"My eyes hate you now, well done —Tim Stone")
means that web readers for the visually impaired read it l-e-t-t-e-r b-y l-e-t-t-e-r


Inline code formatting should be used for short snippets of actual code, including but not limited to AppleScript and shell scripting. Short shell commands such as ls ~ should also be formatted as code, but referring to shell commands such as 'defaults' doesn't need formatting (although some may disagree with this and I'm unlikely to edit to the contrary).

Inline code formatting should not be used in any of the cases listed in your question:


Application names are not code and should be read normally, so they should not be formatted as code.
Directory names, regardless of whether they are system directories, also should not be formatted as code.

However paths may use code formatting; I usually don't for simple paths such as /Applications, but do for longer paths, especially https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/140226those containing globbing such as /Sy*/L*/Priv*/Apple8*/V*/C*/R*/airport, although I may even use block code formatting in cases like this (prepending with four spaces):

/Sy*/L*/Priv*/Apple8*/V*/C*/R*/airport

Menu entries are not code, although in some cases extra formatting may help here. I sometimes write longer menu entry paths with bold formatting such as File → Import From → Bookmarks HTML File… as the path then stands out more from the actual text, usually just write it normally as File → Save.
OS names are like application names—never code. The OS build may be formatted as code depending on its context as these are longer and read character by character.


Also, I've seen code formatting used in other cases, and would like to address that here too:


Web URLs that shouldn't be clicked can use code formatting, but it's not really code and I prefer simply rendering the URL as un-clickable either using a zero width joiner http://​example.com or HTML comment http://example.com (check the source of this post to see how the aforementioned examples are done).


All of this applies to question bodies and comments. Titles do not have code formatting and therefore any Markdown is superfluous.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5THE thing THAT makes TEXT hard TO read IS not CODE formatting PER se BUT rapidly ALTERNATING between ONE format AND another. UNFORTUNATELY pedants OF the WORLD appear TO be TAKING the ABOVE answer TO be DEFINITIVE and NEEDLESSLY removing MORE careful FORMATTING thereby RFENDERING the TEXT in QUESTION l-E-s-S r-E-a-D-a-B-l-E.


















My first post on Meta & I didn't find anything similar by searching...
I see this a lot, on various question/answers - the last line of a code section hidden behind the scroll-bar...



If I check Edit, there is no fault with the user's formatting, they have added lines underneath [& incidentally if I then Cancel the formatting 'fixes' itself]

Is there a 'higher-up' who could have a look at this & fix it?

Some questions just aren't questions, usually meant to be an answer on a question or similar, but there's no NARQ close reason any more.

What should I vote to close such questions as?

This is the question that prompted me to ask this: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/144450/transparent-backed-ios7-status-bar-enjoyhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/144450/transparent-backed-ios7-status-bar-enjoy

Some sites have an off-topic reason for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For lack of NARQ and no doubt this there are long threads on meta stack overflowb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark Yes, but none seemed applicable to this site, which is very different to SO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rather than asking what close reason corresponds to NARQ, I'd suggest you ask whether the post needs to be closed according to one of the current close reasons; if yes, use that one. If no, don't vote to close it.


















We had "Not a real question" as a close reason in the past, but some people might see it as offensive (because usually the OP did think it was a question). Voting to close such posts as "Unclear what you are asking" seems a reasonable alternative (and already hints at the fact that the question needs to be improved).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I thought that any similar text to the old NARQ in a custom close reason would suffer from the same problem that NARQ did originally.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which  was one reason for SO removing NARQ as well


















This is a very hard thing to give a definitive answer to -- it's largely a judgement call on a case-by-base basis.

But if pressed...

Generally I think the answer is no. "Conversations" as answers and subsequent comments should be had in http://chat.stackexchange.com/question-specific chat rooms with the resulting resolution being posted as the answer. You want to keep the Q&A format succinct so the information is easily digestible long in to the future. A rambling conversation on an answer destroys that nice property of the SE Q&A format.

Sometimes, though, the answer is yes. In particular, if the question is asking for something specific but you realize it's not possible but there are alternatives that address the spirit of what's being asked though not necessarily the letter. And, of course, sometimes the question is literally "how do I work through this?" in which case a general answer that aids in debugging and doesn't give a specific resolution to a specific problem is a-okay.

In any case though, if you happen to answer with something the community deems isn't really an answer and fit for the site, it should get flagged and reviewed. Intuition and peer review is, ultimately, the best way to decide these things rather than a set of hard and fast rules.

This site has a longstanding policy to close pre-release software questions as off topic.

Is there clear consensus to expand this to include:


"pre-release software and hardware"
"pre-release products and services"


We can edit the existing default close reason to be either of the above, but I would like to see if there are any downsides to either of these suggestions.

The current default close reason just refers to software

Yes it makes sense to increase the scope from just software to include hardware, products and services.

I've noticed that solutions to questions that require jailbreak are only mentioned if specifically requested by the asker.

There's some discussion on whether to formally extend the prohibition on pre-release topics to explicitly include hardware - so at the moment it's not spelled out in the [help] for the main site.

That being said, questions speculating on Apple's future plans in general are closed as off-topic even without a pre-release hardware clause.

That question fails mostly at the guideline of "Focus on questions about an **actual problem** you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do." In this case, the OP didn't provide what problem is to be solved so the question should probably be closed on those grounds alone. Let's presume there is an _actual problem_ to be solved. I would be willing to allow it to stay open to see if there were authoritative answers...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5- even ones based on the 3000 people that have had a chance to physically measure and report on the pre-release sizes. However, we would want to be very clear, that there's no guarantee the specs won't change. Apple is very clear listing dimensions down to the mm at http://www.apple.com/watch/apple-watch/ so I don't see a problem with someone calculating the size based on clear photographs of the prototypes by Apple.


















I can't comment, can't do jack until i've gained rep, but can't gain rep because can't do anything. Surely a captcha would do the job as well?

Cut-and-paste wholesale from the excellent answer to: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/214174/151364Why do I need 50 reputation to comment? What can I do instead?



Why does this limit exist?

We realize that new users may have valuable comments, and that we may lose some of those contributions by requiring 50 reputation points to unlock the feature. 

However, history and experience have shown that the downsides of allowing everyone to comment are far greater than a few good-quality comments:


There are big problems with spam. Automated filters cannot catch all of it.
Even among the real comments, most would either say "I have the same problem" or "I agree". Such comments do not add any value, and have to be manually removed. 
Comments are very painful to moderate. Stack Exchange sites have a process of community moderation (voting, flagging, review queues) that works great for questions and answers, but not so much for comments. Comments cannot be downvoted or closevoted, nor searched (nor do we want that).
Comments are second class citizens on the Stack Exchange network, not designed to hold information for all eternity. They may get cleaned up at any time. Generally, truly important information should be incorporated into an answer of its own anyway. [Ed.: THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY OPINION!]


Providing good answers will get you 50 rep points in no time. Alternatively, you can https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76251/how-do-suggested-edits-worksuggest edits that improve existing questions and answers. Each of those will gain you 2 reputation points.

But I want to contribute  now. What should I do instead?

Can I put my comment in an answer?

No.

Asking and answering, the core actions on the Stack Exchange network of sites, are open to all users regardless of reputation. 

However, this is not meant as a workaround to the comments barrier. Comments posted as an answer are subject to removal. 

To make requests for clarification, or mere responses to other answers, you need to wait until you have the comment privilege.

How do I write a good answer?

If you are sure you can provide a real answer, then you are of course welcome to go ahead, but make sure it's a https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/214174/151364full, valid answer to the question. If you saw something wrong with an existing answer, do mention it and its flaws, but make sure you provide an alternative solution that can stand on its own. Do not just copy and paste your original comment into the "answer" field.

But I can't write a good answer without more information!

Answers don't have to be exhaustive or infallible, they just need to try to answer the question. It's perfectly fine to post an answer saying, for example, "I'm not sure what the cause of your problem is, but if it's X, you can solve it by doing Y. If that doesn't help, try Z and let me know what it says."  Also, if further information does become available, you can edit your answer later to make it more precise. This is a good habit to get into even if you can comment! 

Welcome to the community, and good luck!

How do I gain reputation?

Another cut-and-paste from this meta question and answer: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/17204/six-simple-tips-to-get-stack-overflow-reputation-fastSix simple tips to get Stack Overflow reputation fast

Aww heck I can summarize it: ANSWER QUESTIONS WELL. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/17250/151364But you should really read the top-voted answer because it's excellent.

If you manage to accrue 200 reputation on one site, you can get an automatic 100 rep on any new site you start on, which gives you access to meta, chat, etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5to muzzle users until they provide enough good answers is just stupid, imho. you are going to miss out on tons of experience from people with skills because they can't be bothered to jump through the hoops of trawling for places to give answers that are not already covered. for example, you have lost me, as i'm blocking stackexhange from my google results.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@flowin this couldn't be further from the truth. First, no one is muzzled. You can post questions and answer questions with no rep. If you have expertise, you can apply it freely. If you have a question, you can ask freely. The only thing you can't do is comment. And this is blocked because statistically speaking, new users abuse comments and try to treat Stack Exchange sites like forums, with a back-and-forth exchange. And that's not how the format works. Requiring users to invest a little time understanding the format before unlocking features is far from onerous. Sorry you think it is.


















Being elected as a moderator doesn't mean you have to continue serving for the rest of your life. Moderators sometimes resign, but sometimes they fade away, becoming less and less active on the site over time. This is a natural and healthy thing.

There seems to be some sort of cleanup process by which Stack Exchange eventually removes the names of inactive moderators from the list of moderators for the site.

Some moderators not active today played instrumental roles in the early days of the site, such that the community would likely not exist today in all its helpfulness were it not for their great work.

Is it possible for there to be some mechanism whereby we can honor the work of our retired forbearers without simply making their names disappear silently from the list of current moderators? Reputation stays forever, and the list of users by reputation acknowledges reputation earned long ago by users who are no longer active. Can the moderation service of our founding elected moderators be similarly honored and cherished?

Actually, asking here on Meta is the correct / canonical way to have someone create a new tag when you can't do it yourself. Commenting may sometimes help, but that's not really why comments exist.

You would want to link to the question here and explain what tag should be created for the item. Feel free to edit your question and tag suggestion into the question above or start a new thread on [meta] here with the pertinent details and we'll see what can or should be done.

I was just about to type up a question regarding installation of OSX Server 4.0 inside VMware Workstation on non-Apple hardware.

The more I typed my question, the better the suggestions in the suggestion box got.

So I checked out the first three and all of them ended up answering an inherently technical question with a reference to the EULA.

Example for one of those questions and answers:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/52789/65841How to install Mac OS X as a guest OS in VMware Workstation 8 (running in Ubuntu host)?




Now don't get me wrong. It's fine if this reference to the EULA accompanies a technical solution (or the statement that it's technically impossible) to the purely technical question. But for the life of me I cannot figure out how such an answer which is borderline legalese can garner so many upvotes or even acceptance.

Questions about the EULA are inherently tied to the jurisdiction under which this EULA is accepted. The relevant jurisdiction is neither clear from a purely technical question (though the assumption always appears to be that it's the US, despite English being official language in many countries) nor would giving the jurisdiction generally help anyone. Who knows what the relevance and validity of the Apple EULA in Zimbabwe, Russia or China is?

If I'd ask a question about the EULA I'd be lucky not to get my question plastered with "IANAL" comments or answers. However, somehow it's legit to answer a completely technical question with a reference to a EULA, taking the EULA at its face value.

A EULA is nothing but a contract and always governed (and overridden) by the jurisdiction under which it is accepted. Assuming what's in the EULA is true to the comma means disregarding that fact.

Yes, I've read https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here?

So could anyone shed any light on how and why such answers are acceptable?

To me it would seem more logical to close such a question as off-topic from the outset, if it is (off-topic). But answering with borderline irrelevant information isn't helping anyone.

Thanks for reading. Double thanks for answering.

I personally am a proponent of letting great questions remain - especially when they have solid technical foundation. I would say, ask your question on the main site and we can open a thread here to discuss improvements if or when it gets closed.


















So many times, a simple question is given a 'correct' answer (I shall use one of my own 'answers' as an example - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/150889/upgrade-iphone-5-from-ios-7-0-4-to-ios-7-1-2Upgrade iPhone 5 from iOS 7.0.4 to iOS 7.1.2)

The chances are that this is the 'correct' answer, yet the OP will never return to show it as such (it doesn't matter for this case whether my actual answer was right or not, it's just an example) & so this question will hang in perpetuity, hogging valuable Google space if nothing else.

The question already has a few up-votes, so the regular 'bad question' scenario doesn't apply.

I guess my real question would be "Does this type of non-question/non-answer" quickly drop off SE after some time, or does it really hang around forever?"
.. or "Can this stuff be cleared up manually?"

I'm convinced editing is the best way to receive rep. All you need to do is fix a couple of typos and bam! You have +2 rep. I know answering is probably the best was to receive rep, but, if you look at my (or most people's answer history), you'll probably notice hardly any have been check marked. This ruins the motivation for answering.

Moreover, answering has a risk/reward factor. While editing only gets a little rep, there is no penalty for it if rejected.

Opinions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Editing most effective way to recieve rep?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The motivation for answering is to improve the site:) You get more rep for being upvoted than you can get for supplying the accepted answer. (10 for **each** up vote and one lot of 15 for being accepted) and even if you don't get the up votes and just acceptances you get a badge


















Editing posts is definitely a way of earning reputation, but it's not the most efficient. The nominal 2 reputation you receive per accepted suggested edit won't earn you a great deal of reputation unless you edit a lot.

https://stackoverflow.com/users/1549818/grgarside?tab=reputationMy Stack Overflow profile mainly consists of editing posts. At the time of writing, I have over https://stackoverflow.com/users/1549818/grgarside?tab=activity&sort=suggestions400 approved suggested edits, earning me https://stackoverflow.com/users/1549818/grgarside?tab=reputation748 reputation out of a total ~1100. However, these 400 edits took a large proportion of time compared with the https://stackoverflow.com/users/1549818/grgarside?tab=answers13 answers I've provided, earning me ~300 reputation. Those 13 answers didn't take very long to write and the reward for the effort I gave was worth it far more than the suggested edits.

In a more extreme case, here on Ask Different, I've earned 160 reputation from my lifetime of suggested edits, including tag wiki edits—an insignificant contribution to the ~35k reputation from https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/37797/grgarside?tab=answersother means.

Only when you edit many, many edits very quickly do they become a worthwhile strategy for earning reputation, but suggested edits should be substantial improvements to a post and making minor/bad edits would get you suspended if they get rejected.

Posting great answers will earn you https://apple.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=allplenty of reputation, far exceeding that from suggested edits.

Finally, a point of note regarding rejected suggested edits: yes, there's no penalty for having a few rejected edits, but having a high reject/approve ratio will get you suspended, if not manually by a moderator.

I declined your flag since I try not to delete things that are not actually harmful. In this case, someone had already commented asking the poster to improve the post.
It's sometimes a decision point to leave something up so a new person to the site can see how edits / collaboration work. Often the community editing process can fix things and the OP can learn directly as opposed to reading some FAQ or catching another post get improved.
It's another thing to remove totally off-topic comments.
In this case I chose to leave that post up in hopes that the first answer by that user would get improved and we don't shut the door on that person.
Also keep in mind, we do not delete posts that are blatantly incorrect. (Those should have votes and constructive comments to explain how they are wrong.) Deletion is for keeping the post on topic and I saw some faint merit in leaving the post up. Apparently the moderator that deleted it felt differently as that can often be the case on marginal posts.
Bringing it up here on meta is the best thing since everyone can see, discuss and learn. For me, the harm in a marginal answer on a question from 2011 wasn't worse than shutting down a new user trying to contribute their first answer - especially when a comment had already pointed out politely the weakness of the first version of that post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would second that approach. Alienation is not the aim; improvement & learning is. Though I appreciate the original meta question, this provides a good balanced overview of the process.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whatever the merits of this particular case, as someone who comes to find good answers more than to provide them, I think failure to remove blatently incorrect posts is not a really positive aspect of the forum.  We already have a bunch over at Apple where nothing, no matter how stupid, is ever removed (unless offensive in some way).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomGewecke The [voting system](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/why-vote) is designed to hide blatantly wrong content without needing removal. The editing system means that even the most incorrect or marginal post is easily corrected by anyone that cares to submit an edit. We only remove _harmful_ posts and even that is done with great care to ensure an edit can't save the post with a proper disclaimer of the potential harm.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The voting system (for answers, anyway) is designed to cause blatantly wrong _answers_ to fall to the bottom. It wasn't an answer. If the consensus is that comments posted as answers to get around the reputation barrier should be left (which to me is a textbook reason to flag the answer), then I am unclear for what the flag "this is not an answer" is intended.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mike, specifically to your point in your answer - the commenter ("User A") wasn't trying to contribute an answer. User A was calling another user ("User B") out on User B posting an answer to pick on the OP, instead of User B actually trying to answer the OP's question. Given that I'm not sure how much encouragement should be given for User A trying to start an argument on, as you note, a post from 2011.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Couldn't agree more!


















The proper place to propose a tag, if you really want to, is here on meta, but my proposal for where to propose a tag is nowhere.

Please think twice before proposing a new tag. We have far too many tags already. Tags are for filtering: people with particular expertise can search for questions tagged with their preferred subject matter.  People with topics that do not interest them can use tags to block posts they don't want to see.

If you really want a tag to exist, be ready to explain why you think there is a population of people who are specifically interested in reading or ignoring questions tagged with that tag that would not have their interests defined by existing tags.

Tags are NOT just to convey information; that can go in the body of the post. Tags are for filtering.

Feel free to start a separate discussion regarding this.


















Sorry for the ambiguous title.

Better but more wordy question ought to be...
Is it policy or does it make sense to upvote a question where the user obviously did something incredibly dim, but the question/answer itself could be useful to other people?

I use this as an example [the fact that I answered it has no bearing, I'm still tempted to upvote the question as useful]
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153000/mac-stopped-working-after-deleting-hidden-filesDeleted hidden files and now Mac won't boot, how do I fix this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Policy/opinion on upvoting a questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Allow me the soapbox for a moment: there is far too little voting on this site, both up and down. Voting tends to follow along the "well, I wouldn't do that so no vote from me" lines which isn't really how it should work. A good question is a good question. Similarly multiple good answers in a question can be upvoted because a good answer is a good answer.


















From the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/why-voteFAQ on Why is voting important:


  Voting up a question or answer signals to the rest of the community that a post is interesting, well-researched, and useful, while voting down a post signals the opposite: that the post contains wrong information, is poorly researched, or fails to communicate information. The more that people vote on a post, the more certain future visitors can be of the quality of information contained within that post – not to mention that upvotes are a great way to thank the author of a good post for the time and effort put into writing it!


So the key idea is not to vote on the actions/problems of others but primarily on whether a question is "interesting, well-researched, and useful". Which also means that down voted questions can have up voted answers (and vice versa, which is probably the case more often).

But also keep in mind that the SE network is all about sharing information and giving back to the community. So if you see ways to improve a question, go ahead and do so because it will benefit all parties involved (the OP might learn how to write better questions, you will get some reputation for the edit and the community has a better question attracting better answers).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question I referred to has no merit except to warn others not to do the same, hence my hesitancy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tetsujin that question you linked to is great, if maybe a little poorly worded, "I deleted hidden files and now my machine won't boot, how do I fix this?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. All yours if you want to change it to a simple 'I blew it, how do i fix it' question. I do feel the idea of the question is useful, however awkwardly it's currently worded.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tetsujin I encourage you to improve, not flag, questions and answers on the site when they have some merit to them. I'll use this as an example if you need a guide, but it's not on the moderators to do all the question clean up here, it's on the community as a whole. Edit: I didn't need much work at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. Thanks. I do make edits, but as I'm still a relative newbie, I avoid the ones that may need major revision or a more experienced mod, I tend to stick to the 'inline an image, clarify some syntax, fix a typo' etc for now.


















All moderators can (and will if necessary) reopen questions, but so can high-rep users if a question is flagged for a reopen. Flagging for reopen can be done either explicitly (by clicking on the "reopen" label below the question) or be editing the text of a question.

In the question linked above, the comments indicate why an edit is deemed necessary, primarily because as written the question doesn't say anything about the solution in the linked question not solving the problem in Yosemite any longer. So if you want the question reopened, the easiest way would be to rewrite the question to show the steps already tried (e.g. changing the setting in iPhoto).

PS: Please keep in mind that it's not just the moderators who can moderate/improve the site -- all users can (and are invited to) do that.

If a question is a duplicate of one without an answer, the question **cannot be marked as a duplicate of it** (unless it's an edge case where both questions are by the OP for the purposes where OP reposts their question). As far as the system is concerned, the linked question does answer the same question as the one you asked (as marked by a user—not trying to imply any AI/etc here) and is therefore marked as duplicate. This means you should edit your question body to explain why it is not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did. @grgarside
I will never again contribute to this site. Not worth the frustration.


















I'm tempted to merge the long tag into the short one.

If someone wants to type mobile... they will see and select the synonym, but MDM is a great tag IMO.

Before I merge things, let's see if there is more support for your request to point the short tag at the long one...



Clearly, we should merge these - the only question is which way (which we can easily reverse later if needed).

You do not have to award the bounty to anyone. You cannot award the bounty to yourself.

The point of the bounty is to "buy" exposure and attention for the question. That's what you paid for; that's what you got. If it results in a great answer, awesome. In this case, you determine that it did not generate a sufficient answer from someone other than you (and you get to make that call - you paid for the bounty). You don't have to award the points.

I've cleaned up most of them now. If you run into more, just flag them as usual.

As for the reason, I can only guess. Maybe there was a change of rules on CoC server side which triggered some changes in the app.

This kind of thing is very common on Ask Different when a change occurs with something within the scope of the site. It begins with a reasonable question on the subject, and thanks to SE's very high SERP rank, is the #1 result for many search queries.

People then post 'me too' answers, either because they want to participate in the question so that they believe they can be updated when the question is updated (like some forums do, unaware of the 'favourite' feature), or simply because they want to express that they are experiencing the same problem.

Especially with the topic of Clash of Clans, where the stereotypical demographic of the general user base usually results with low quality posts, the situation is extenuated, but the same thing happens with other topics as well.

Downvote, comment and flag the posts. If you have >10k, protect the question to prevent further answers, and vote to delete the posts if you have >20k.

Editing for the sake of bumping is discouraged, as is posting duplicate questions. Bounties are appropriate, but you only have 121 reputation.

It would be reasonable, though, to ask a new question and specify that your new question is asking specifically about what is available in 2014 using iTunes version (whatever) running on operating system version whatever. Even link to the old question to let people know you know about it but are looking for something more current.

I am sure you are aware of this web site that pops up in Google search using the Titles from the Ask Different.

All it does is it shows the copy of the Title or the question, but not the answers.

It is loaded with adds ect..

Just wondering is someone has found a great way to get high web site hits and make lots of money that way?

Maybe it is my Google search but the Tile is definitely the same the time of post is with in a hour and sometimes even the body text is almost the same.

We currently (as of November 19) have 65 questions tagged "Clash of Clans" on the site, with an average question score of 0.2. Currently, these questions have generated a grand total of two answers that have received multiple up votes. This isn't a recipe for quality Q&A, which is what the site is designed to encourage.

Accordingly, I'd like to make questions about the particulars of specific games to be off-topic for this site. Maybe there are fora that can generate constructive discussion about "how do I change users in Sonic and Zelda Assassin: Grand Theft Unicorn Edition," but it doesn't seem to be working here.

The only two CoC answers with multiple up votes are pretty trivial answers themselves: one quotes the documentation for the game and the other indicates that there is no OS X version of the game. Good information, but if these are the best responses CoC questions generate, maybe that's a sign that the site is better off without CoC questions.

Yes. This makes sense to me. The answer to the vast majority of these questions has been: contact the developer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Accomplished: http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanielLawson Not sure if the wording accomplishes the goal. "Questions about the particulars of specific games" seems to imply that "How do I get to level XYZ" is off-topic, but maybe not "bugs" (such as "I can't login to my 12th CoC account because it keeps crashing") or [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/92852). I would change it to "Questions about the particulars of specific games, such as game account or in-app purchase issues, should be directed to the game's developer." Also disagree with "manufacturers" in the current wording, but that's a definition quibble. :P


















"questions about the particulars of specific games to be off-topic "  

That hits the nail on the head for me. 

CoC had a few days of irritation, due to server issues, but in the relatively short time I've been here, it's the only game that seems to crop up as a taggable one. The rest don't seem to generate questions here. So, blanket ban on games questions would almost seem to be 'CoC only' anyway.

Having typed that, I'm not sure whether I voted yes or no, but games just don't seem to fit AskDifferent's ethos anyway; there are a million sites better-suited.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not in any way opposed to questions about games, by the way. It's just that those questions don't tend to produce very good answers here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They tend not to be very good questions, gigo ;-)  tbh, banning them won't stop them happening, if something like the CoC server issue happens again. The downside of getting good Google results for SE is it's easy to find.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They have been terrible questions that have led to great answers. These aren't them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'I dun gone & busted it' rarely gets good answers ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5AskDifferent should be about the OS, hardware, and software relationships to the OS and hardware of the Apple ecosystem only. Not **crap like this**. If someone is asking how to install, remove, or get a refund from their kid spending $$$ without their approval on a stupid F2P game, that's okay, because it's not about the game or service provider. Anything else == trash.


















I'm going to say we don't need to make COC off topic.

It seems odd to rule out one app because we already have all the tools we need to close low quality (and total crap) questions.

If someone can show me a question that needs to be closed as "off topic" if we were to implement this request, my suspicion is that it could also easily be closed as low quality, unclear, or duplicate.

If people don't document the exact build of COC and the iOS version, then that's good enough for me to close it as too broad and/or unclear.

I'd rather a few canonical answers get assembled and then we can dupe vague questions and/or close them with little to no additional effort. I don't see how adding a clause to the off-topic makes things better for anyone.

As things stand, we have this clause:


  Questions about the particulars of specific games, such as game account or in-app purchase issues, should be directed to the game's developer.


What if we substituted running apps or Apple apps for games. Isn't this a big broad ban for no real benefit?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The thing is, there are no canonical answers. Most of the questions revolve around "How do I use two (or more) accounts on the same device and not have it screw up like it just did?" There is no answer to that, because the developer explicitly does not support playing more than one game (account) on a single device, but they haven't managed to keep it from working (most of the time). With all the stunts they pull to keep you from even restarting your game, I wouldn't be surprised that they have something built-in to thwart multiple account use which in turn drives all these questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding your last question, I would say that account or in-app purchase issues should be directed to the developer of any app, not just games...but the questions we get are about CoC and some of its ilk (to a much lesser degree). I wouldn't be opposed to expanding the wording to include all apps for those particular issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tubedogg Wouldn't a canonical answer tell the asker explicitly where the developer site for support is for that specific app? Instead we are brushing all these questions aside and not even answering them IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This strikes me as no different than Hackintosh questions. We chose to make them off-topic because they didn't produce helpful answers; we didn't like the effect the questions had on our community. If the questions led to good answers, we'd want them, but I don't see any evidence they do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whilst I really don't like the general question quality of Clash of Clans questions, I support what is being said in this answer. I don't think Clash of Clans or other iOS game infrastructure should be off-topic as it is essentially Game Center. All that's required here is [more proactive duplicate closures](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/16563111#16563111) and possibly effort in a canonical question regarding the main problem that people are facing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, stating that Clash of Clans is off-topic without an actual closure reason has lead to some [very poor closure reasons](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/158339/game-center-and-clash-of-clans#comment186158_158339). I would prefer that iOS games and other apps remain on-topic, and poor questions closed with the standard closure reasons of unclear/broad/etc.


















I'm adding this as another answer just to make one specific point/question/poll…

How many of the mods & high rep others here have ever actually played CoC? or had any of the issues we've seen described on the topic?

Or are we, between us, providing the best LMGTFY service to single-digit AD users that we possibly can, yet coming up far shorter than we would on a question about, say, Terminal & how to use sudo?

Personally, I wouldn't expect a 50k rep user on here to be a gamer; I'd expect them to have a deep knowledge of MacOS & iOS - that's how they got their rep in the first place. 

I'm not casting us as old, crotchety & bah-humbug - I just think there may be a significant proportion who wouldn't give a rat's ass for gaming & would consider they have far better things to think about.

[Doesn't really need comments, though who am I to stop you;-) but just a straw poll by voting this up or down might give some indication as to degree of agreement with my point]

Those questions are not only on topic, but I view them as good ones. My guess is someone doesn't like questions about third party products.

I'll watch for vote patterns, but so far nothing is in "moderator needs to act" range. If you see two dozens of votes, please flag a post or bump this again and we can see if there is a pattern that would merit intervention.

I was attempting to upload a picture to add https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/161701/how-can-i-force-or-an-application-to-be-launched-to-the-2nd-monitorto my question here but I kept getting this message box (which I've never seen before across StackExchange):



Which, after clicking OK, lead to this page, which I've also never seen on StackExchange.

What is "framing"?  I've never heard that and had no idea my pictures had this.  Is there an easy way I can remove the framing from my pictures before attempting to upload them so that StackExchange doesn't crash when attempting to do it?

The maximum image size you can upload is 2 MB. If you try to upload an image greater than this size, you receive this error.

Framing is regarding the error message that Imgur provides, not the image itself. Stack Exchange does not allow framing in general and Imgur trying to do this will cause this error.

What is the recommended practice to avoid or eliminate been bullied by another user that seems to have a OCD problem.

Clearly that user is targeting me, and even commenting to my comments with negative replies.

Is there a corrective action moderators can do to stop this?

Often people are correct about who is doing what, but when they are not, it's very bad form to falsely accuse the wrong person. Personally, I don't recall a flag with "bullying" in it so if you can elaborate on what "flagging constantly" looks like in your situation this might be something a moderator can help with.

(similar to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27897/making-fonts-larger-in-apps-under-lion/"How to make text appear larger in various apps in OS X")

I would absolutely welcome others to contribute to the list.



What is the best way to do that?


Add a table to https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/163399/54644the original question where it is very relevant (but not asked for directly), and adds much specifics to general statements like "some support, other don't; some are larger, others are the same"
Post a separate question, similar to "How to make text appear larger in various apps in OS X"--which is definitely better and easier for others to contribute and reuse




Should I definitely mark the question (and/or my answer) as a "community wiki"; how do I decide?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Listing iOS apps supporting DynamicType: OK? How?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems helpful, but ultimately ill-suited for the site. Any list you make is going to go stale. Who will maintain it? You?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. I don't expect too many contributors, and yes I'm ready to organize answers of half a dozen contributors (upper limit in my experience). Is that what you mean by "maintain"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apps come and go. Someone needs to stay on top of the list to make sure stuff that's gone from the App Store is gone from the list. That's what I mean from maintain. It feels a bit like a magnet for advertising too. In general, I am not a fan "big lists of things" on this site. They don't work well with the SE format.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But it did work pretty well in "How to make text appear larger in various apps in OS X" linked above. How my proposal is different?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. See above, forgot to mention you there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On that point, we appear to disagree. Because I don't think that worked "pretty well" at all. I don't think you could point me at a CW Q&A on this site that'd I think worked out well at all. But, I'm not authority here, and you should open the question up as a CW question like you proposed and let the community decide! :D


















This questions either should go games.stackexchange or elsewhere. They are not about features of OS X, iOS or Game Center. They are about specific of game, mostly according to saving progress.

And on the side note I was off the think different for a while and I see we have pretty much low quality questions now. I might say we are flooded with them. Was it that it you have to get some points before asking a question before? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You have always been able to ask questions with no reputation


















So, to sum up my thoughts from the conversation above: post it. If it's good, the community will vote it up, if they disagree, they'll vote it down. I agree you should do it as CW, organized like that other CW Q&A you linked to.

My options are: (1) just drop it => no one will ever use it; (2) attach it to the existing question where some people will be able to find it and use for their own reference, but hardly anyone will contribute; (3) create a separate question so that not only people can reuse it, but also have a chance to contribute. So yes, I'm going to go ahead and post it as a separate community wiki question / answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Create a new question gets my vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Started listing the apps I tested [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/163576/which-of-ios-apps-allow-customizing-font-size/163579#163579). Still unsure whether to choose text listing or a preformatted table format--any feedback appreciated. Both options are shown there to easier compare the approaches.


















The dawn of a new year, 2015, now approaches, or has already approached, either way it means that it is now time to reset our Community Promotion Ads!

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting apple related open source apps
the site's twitter account
script packs or power tools
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url

Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements

I see that there are some users who left bad comments in the question when they do not understand what the OP wants to ask.
I hope that the moderators can warn them not to do it again because what they did will discourage the OP from asking new questions.

I noticed that (un)accepts...



...and bounties...



are red there. Why are all the rep received from bonuses RED?! 

I understand unaccepts - they give negative rep gain and therefore logically made red (on any SE site).

But why do accepts have a red background? It should be green, that's the wonderful color which is used for accepts everywhere on SE. Also bounties: why red again? Why not blue, the known color of bounties?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are the positive bonus rep red in the reputation tab?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Blue for bounties and bounties awarded is a good idea.


















Questions shouldn't be deleted just because they haven't received an answer. Despite everything, an answer may still be found in the future and deleting the question doesn't help anyone as the original research is lost. Moving the research to a new question defeats the purpose and the original question may as well remain if this occurs.

Bounties are the main way attention is drawn to a question. Ask Different has very few active bounties running at any one time which means that bounties can be quite effective at attracting attention.

There's a silver  https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/badges/44/necromancerNecromancer badge to be had for users who answer questions like this, so there's still a incentive to research and answer such questions.

I don't think the question needs to be reframed as such, but providing an update with the latest information might be beneficial. Furthermore, a bounty will attract attention and may get the question seen by someone who has some crucial information in resolving the problem.

But I did however rebuild my Mac OS X setup with a clean install of Mac OS X 10.9.5; previously it was just piles of upgrades since 10.6.8. Maybe I will have better luck now? Who knows. Snowstorm in the northeast so might make this a small project. Thanks again!


















They'll show up in the comment queue and all moderators will see the flag. The system doesn't hide the flag from the moderator who's comment was flagged. We discuss flags on our own comments and avoid moderating ourselves.

Your answer was flagged _by the community_ as not unique. Stack Exchange isn't a forum. It's a Q&A site. I suggest taking a look at https://apple.stackexchange.com/tour to familiarize yourself with how it works. You could have put your screenshot on the existing answer as an edit to improve it, for example, and helped make it more cogent. You can start a new meta question about what happened on your answer if you'd like to have it discussed in detail with the rest of the community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. I already have 90K rep at SO. I know how these sites work, and I know that *deleting* someone's answer is one of the most extreme measures, taken only when an answer is very bad and gets multiple downvotes, not **up**votes. I've also spotted the patterns of negative communities quite a few times. And I don't like the pattern of behavior I've seen in just two days here. Not to me, but to people asking legitimate questions.


















I was writing a question on http://apple.stackexchange.comapple.stackexchange.com. I saw the little “draft saved”. I went away, then I went back to the page.

When I created https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27897/making-fonts-larger-in-apps-under-lion/Making fonts larger in apps under Lion, it was partly to learn the answer and partly to try the sort of question that I hoped Community Wiki would work well for. I don't think it was a disaster, but it didn't turn out as great as I'd hoped it would. Maybe your question would take off in that format; if it can, I hope it does. I'd recommend trying, but I'm not overly hopeful it will get a great response. I'd recommend a separate question.

This question just passed 1,000 views today. I understand how "tumbleweed questions" work (I have the badge on several sites), and that's what I thought my question was. But unless these views came all at once from some automated source, this question is not a tumbleweed.

So what's up with this question? Is it on the wrong StackExchange site? It has one non-answer, and the user never responded to my comment asking for clarification.

I would flag it for migration to StackOverflow or even ServerFault. Your question deals more with Hadoop than it does with OS X and Hadoop is way out of scope for this site. There are very little developer service experts viewing questions here.

To your voting question: we suffer from poor voting participation on this site. It's a long-standing issue we've been trying to solve by promoting voting behaviour and such through commenting on posts and in the chat channel. But we deal with higher number of "passerby" type users here because of our subject nature. Casual computer users are more common here than on a site like StackOverflow or ServerFault.

As for visibility: you can always attach a bounty to the question to make it more visible. I find letting people know about it in the chat channel can help too. Though even the chat channel isn't as active as it is some place like StackOverflow.

I just went through my flags and saw that some were declined with the following reason:


  flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention


For example: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141591/ios-create-un-resettable-and-undeletable-appthese https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128623/circuit-simulator-tool-for-os-xtwo questions were flagged as low quality and migratable respectively. These actions require mod intervention, but the flags were declined with the above reason.

So: why shouldn't I have flagged these type of questions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When not to flag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I declined that flag on the first question and honestly: I don't remember why. It was over half a year ago.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. Oh, these were just two examples, I was more aiming at the general case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yea, but usually I can look and it'd be something obvious like I'd rather you had down voted it or made an edit or something like that. But I have zero clue in this case. If you flagged that today I would have put it on hold. Sorry about that. Human and all that...


















Does that mean I already raised it on this particular post but forgot, or that I've used up my day's ration of this type of flag?
… or something else?

I've seen it twice today, but wasn't paying close enough attention to what may have caused it. I certainly didn't think I'd raised enough flags for the system to limit me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"you have already raised this type of flag"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you add a link to the involved question/answer if you see the message again?


















Without details, I would trust that you actually flagged that specific post already.

The message for "go away" due to no flags left is different.

However, if the code burps, you could get these when the conditions are not present. Hard to say for sure unless it continues.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd guessed it may have been a hiccup. I was trying to look back through the queues & find which one it was, but no joy. Re patrix's comment, I'll link if I see one again.


















This was a bug. Generally, the error message is meant to show if you've flagged the post before, but a bug caused this to break. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/248107/222623This is now fixed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aha - nice find. Thought it felt like a bug, but once I'd really spotted what happened, I never saw it again that day to test the theory.


















There are a lot of reasons why people loose access to their computers, most of them are legitimate. So unless there is a clear indication that something is amiss, these questions are perfectly on-topic and can be answered, often easily by referring the user to the appropriate Apple Support pages or by finding the duplicate question which already has been answered before.

Please keep in mind that we are not the police or so, so there is no way to verify the story/background of a question anyway. If in doubt, flag it and move on.

Regarding "low quality" flags in general, there isn't very much a moderator can do which non-mod users can't do as well


downvote
leave a comment asking for clarification/improvements
improve the post directly by editing it (this is actually the preferred option)


That's why I tend to decline "low quality" flags from higher-rep users (with higher rep starting at the point where the user gets access to the review queue).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is also the approach I take. It doesn't take a mod to down vote a low quality answer. If something is ambiguously an answer, but low quality, I'll decline the flag. Users are expected to be voting on SE sites.


















As you have a good answer with a cite of a reliable source then obviously the question is answerable even if the answer is no.

I was the voter for closing mainly because with no definite answer it seemed to be opinion based and so not exact - which I agree is debatable. But in general with no answer I could not see how this question was of use. With an answer it it should stay. 

Note closed questions will be found on Google search so will still be visible - it requires deletion to remove them.

I would note that this is an easy question to deal with here as the state is only affected by one day. Other old questions are more problematic as the correct answer changes many times over time.

If it hadn't happened, the question could have slept for eternity & I guess many eventually do. I was happy I got off my fat one & found an answer. I'm still not really sure I had a true question above, but just to discuss it & how things like this fade over time, I guess.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So the close vote had its (by SE definition) intended result - it got an improved answerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess, yes. Happy SE users all round ;)


















The edit was purely for formatting and IMO didn't make it significantly better. Secondly, the author of the post disagreed with the specific edit.

That's two strikes, so a moderator rolled back the edit.



Editing is one of the aspects that include multiple guidelines which are often at conflict. I get it's a pet peeve to "mis use" certain formatting items, but if you print the original answer out on paper, or look at it in any standard web browser - it's in no way unclear or unuseful.

You are correct that standard formatting is asked for in [help] but there's also an aspect of allowing the original poster to have a little more weight in things that are style as opposed to substance in many cases.

Guidelines:


The OP used valid markdown - https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/formattinghttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/formatting


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editingEditing Guidelines:

Edits are expected to be substantial and to leave the post better than you found it. Common reasons for edits include:


To fix grammar and spelling mistakes
To clarify the meaning of the post (without changing that meaning)
To include additional information only found in comments, so all of the information relevant to the post is contained in one place
To correct minor mistakes or add updates as the post ages
To add related resources or hyperlinks


Clearly, substantial is a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8cmatter of opinion in many cases. Basically, When I reviewed the post after you asked on meta, I saw George's edits as failing to meet any of these criteria. I understand many feel that using "code blocks" is a "mistake" however, when you point that out to the OP and they say they intentionally formatted it that way - we're not into opinion and judgement.

If you wish to make a second answer with the formatting of your choice, that might be the best avenue if you really feel the post needs correcting and if you comment and the OP declines your help with the edit. In that case, the moderation will arrange a chat room for the editor and the OP to discuss things in hopes of coming to a mutual agreement. Only if that fails would a moderator step in and perhaps lock the post in one state.

We're not there - we're just at the "one edit was made and then rolled back" stage.

Thanks for all the comments and down votes - it's nice knowing that people really care about the small things. I ask that everyone keep "the big picture" in mind - the site exists to allow great answers. Why antagonize one poster with minutia like changing their emphasis style when nothing else is wrong with their answer and a ton of things are right with the answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The edit made it better as reading formatted empahsis is not nice or easy - see the many Meta SE entries where I think the overwhelming option is to remove using code formatting for emphasisb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark I agree - however when there is a dispute between the poster and the editor - we usually allow the poster to prevail. It's best to comment and chat with the person directly to see if they can be convinced to accept the edit and flag a moderator if you can't reach agreement.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm puzzled.  This was not rolled back by the original poster.  The original poster doesn't seem to have objected to the edit (based on the comments I can see).  Instead, the edit was just rolled back by a moderator.  I think this is taking your guidelines too far, and I urge you to reconsider your approach to these kinds of edits.  The edit made the answer better and I don't see a good reason to roll it back in these circumstances.   (cont.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Frankly, even if the OP *had* objected, the OP doesn't get a veto on this.  As [site policy states](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editing), "If you are not comfortable with the idea of your contributions being collaboratively edited by other trusted users, this may not be the site for you."  But from what I can see this looks like a situation where there's not even a dispute -- grgarside made an edit that improved the answer, and it was rolled back on the speculation that the OP might object.  And even if the OP had objected, he doesn't get a veto.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the edit was rejected as too minor and bumping an old thread, I'd understand that more.  That said, this is not an old thread -- it was already on the front page, so it didn't bump an old thread to the front -- so I'm not sure that applies here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand what bmike is saying here, but @D.W. makes some very good points. My edit was 44 seconds ([I'm pretty fast!](http://data.stackexchange.com/apple/query/79305/fastest-answers-in-all-tags)) after the answer was posted—the bump was the rollback. I disagree that it was a minor edit and I would have made the edit even if I didn't have full edit privileges. I have no incentive to edit (having surpassed 2k reputation a long time ago and obviously don't receive +2 for my edits) other than improving the quality of written communication throughout this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dw Thanks. The OP did ask explicitly for moderator to review the edit. Some conversations about moderation are between the team and that user. Also, "improved" is a matter of taste here. There are conflicting guidelines and there was no review due to the editing and rollback of the post by trusted users and trusted moderators. P.S. look at the post history and you can see both who and when they made changes. It's best to be specific rather than saying "you" (and @ george - I've edited my answer to address thoughts in well upvoted comment - I do sincerely appreciate all the comments!)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really appreciate everything said by all parties in this discussion. It is very interesting to see the community views on this and I have considered all the points made. When I wrote my other answer on this subject ~6 months ago, I was unaware of just how much of a problem this was and I think my choice of vocabulary at the time doesn't reflect my current view—this has now been rectified. I'm not sure I understand what “conflicting guidelines” you are referring to by; do you mind providing a link to ‘both sides’ *per se*? [cont.]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know no review took place on my edit, but had it been reviewed and been rejected, I'd still be here on meta! I don't make edits that I think would be rejected if it the edit had been a suggested edit. The edit was not solely cosmetic as it changes both the markup of the page and causes screen readers (etc.) to 'see' it differently. I encourage the community to question any of my current or past actions in chat or meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside I don't think anyone is criticizing this action or any of yours. I appreciate edits and in most cases don't roll them back. This was an unusual case but not something I was inclined to revert or roll back a second time. If there is truly a screen reader failure - let's open that as a new request on meta and get the SE engineers involved.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is not uncommon on *this specific SE site* to use code formatting for menu actions. It has been that way since site inception. All other edits made to that post were incredibly minor and brought no value to the answer. Mountains out of mole hills here.


















We've had several questions where someone is asking for mailing and/or sharing of files. Here is the latest:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173516/how-can-i-extract-the-mail-and-messages-icons-for-iphone-6-plushttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173516/how-can-i-extract-the-mail-and-messages-icons-for-iphone-6-plus


Should we close these or can they be saved?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should I close a question if someone is asking for mailing them files?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've asked this here so that we can host the discussion that got off-track on the linked question. It really was a meta discussion with valid points, but the comments no longer were focused on making that specific question better. ***Spoiler*** - _I've edited the question and it shouldn't need to be closed in current form. The [original version](http://apple.stackexchange.com/revisions/173516/1) needed the helpful edits and thanks to all for being kind to a newcomer.


















It depends :)

This one I think not because we get into the issue of are these icons under copyright of the supplier (in this case Apple I think) and would they allow this. This needs to be thought out in general (for example macports provides binary downloads in many cases but depending on license it will only provide source in the cases.)

In general on files etc I would say no as in effect the user is asking for a link only answer.

If you can answer in a way such that the user can generate the files then that is OK
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't confuse the potential with one bad answer with whether a question is on or off-topic. The question only exists to educate and be a foil for the possibility of a good answer. Closing that one example (or the class in general) seems to go against the SE mission to amass knowledge without needing to arrive even close to the legal agreement that is required to participate. http://stackexchange.com/legal - I would move your final sentence to follow "It Depends" and conclude that as long as it can be edited to ask how things work, we shouldn't close these. Is that your position?


















There's two main categories that these questions fit that, whilst related, are substantially different and require different resolutions IMO:


OS X

For OS X, these types of question are more common as files can be deleted or overwritten accidentally or in an attempt to replace them with user-created content and then wish to revert to the original.

With OS X, it is generally not necessary to upload the files for the user as they can extract the file from an install media or use the Recovery HD, as discussed in the canonical Q&A that was created a while ago:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116611/how-can-i-get-back-a-system-file-after-deleting-it-from-my-macHow can I get back a system file after deleting it from my Mac?


This means that an answer along the lines of how to achieve this for the specific file mentioned in a user's question could be provided and a link to the aforementioned question could be provided, or the question could be close-voted as a duplicate of the question.

Either way, this situation is avoided in most cases through guiding the user to recover the file themselves.
iOS

This is much rarer as iOS doesn't allow a user to accidentally delete core system files, and jailbroken users are generally more careful.

The more common case for this I can imagine is for development purposes. Jailbreaking is the only case I can see for this, as I can't see a case for needing iOS system files for developing App Store apps.


If what they are requesting is generally-public information (such as flagship images e.g. app icons), I don't see a problem in providing them.
If they are requesting binaries, I don't think these should be provided by the community.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Err... iOS does allow a user to delete core files, I sadly have been there, done that. Also, if we upload images for people, that's copyright violation.


















As you can see, Ask Different community site got a slight design update today. I have moved site's CSS to a newly refactor LESS system, so it's easier for us to fix SE network CSS bugs globally going on forward. Also I've updated site's logo and icons to SVG for retina support. Visually it should "feel" the same as the old site, but with updated Apple aesthetics(yes, I did flatten all the things). I have retired Lucida Sans for Helvetica.

This update should retro-actively fix most of the old CSS bugs. If you see any new ones, or old ones not being fixed, please let me know!

P.S. I can't believe it's been over 4 years since AD launched. Here's the https://i.imgur.com/H9Q9b7V.pngoriginal design when the site first launched.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Site design updateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome! Thank you! Looks snazzy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's great, but I noticed that with the new updates, the designs of sites become less and less unique. Now the fonts are the same everywhere, the vote buttons, favorite button and The Checkmark are the same everywhere, only color differs in active state. Elements are now aligned with no difference on all the new sites and the sites with recently updated design. The only major difference between those sites is logo and, in some places, color scheme (and metas are almost indistinguishable, if I can't see the logo). Ah yes. Tag designs also differ a bit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But I love the new top bar on main site :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nicael We only make visual changes when needed, sites should still retain their individual style. We did standardize icons when they don't affect the overall look and feel of the site. In the case of Ask Different, I used Helvetica because that's what Apple uses for the latest OS now. Some elements are more standardize now, e.g. tags and badges because they'd reduce layout issues across the network.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looks great!!!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we get [the new profile page update](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/249951/help-us-test-the-shiny-new-user-activity-page-plus-a-bunch-of-new-features) as well?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike it's coming soon!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect.

Overall the update is awesome. I really like the new fonts and the really like the updated look to the Markdown input box for question asking and answering.

I'm noticing, on my Thunderbolt display (which is attached to my 15" rMPB), that the top bar text has a bad case of the jaggies.



(Direct link: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zPc7z.pnghttp://i.stack.imgur.com/zPc7z.png)

The Thunderbolt display is running at native 2560 x 1440 resolution.

For comparison here's how it looks on the retina display on the MacBook Pro (which is great):



(Direct link: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XywMV.pnghttp://i.stack.imgur.com/XywMV.png)

I'm using Chrome 41.0.2272.76 (64-bit) on OS X 10.2.2 to view the site but it renders equally jaggy in Safari.

@mark 

create a user style sheet with for example:

tr.comment>td {

    font: 16px Lucida Sans !important; 

}


---------- Or

tr.comment>td {

    font: 15px Helvetica !important; 

}


Save the file ( plain text) it as  stackComments.css

And then in the Safari preferences -> Advanced: 

Use the style sheet drop down option 'other' to navigate and select your style sheet.

This should change the font size and font to whatever you set it to.

I recently asked this question https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/170938/macbook-air-usb-c-to-usb-aAre there USB-A to USB-C adapters for the Early 2015 MacBook and it was closed as "primarily opinion-based" due to there not being enough detail since it was all rumours then. Now the 12″ Air has been launched, could we re-open it? This is because there's more official detail about it and if not there will be soon.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to get my question re-opened?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for raising the issue on meta. I'll have a look and let you know...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also - you will want to be clear if you are asking about the MacBook that's announced but not for sale as opposed to the MacBook Air that you can buy today and has legacy sized USB ports.


















As it stands, it's both opinion-based and off topic. We are for practical questions about shipping hardware. I would say you can edit to ask more "how to determine how USB-C works and less dependent on Apple releasing a modified MacBook Air in 2015.

The short answer, is no one can order any Apple product with USB C so there's not much benefit to the site to have a speculative discussion question open. If and when hardware is orderable and/or announced with technical details - flag that question for moderator review if you don't have the reputation to cast a reopen vote.

If you were to change this to be - is there anything in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#TYPE-CUSB-C connector specification that makes it impossible to plug in a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Connector_typesStandard A USB connector - I couldn't see keeping it closed.

Basically, when you have a hardware purchase dilemma, ask here how to educate yourself to understand the technology directly. Illuminate that core question with the hardware you wish to buy - but make the question about how does one learn to understand [protocol | connector | software | performance benchmarking | etc... ] so that you can make a good decision.

Shopping questions that revolve around price, avaiability, or soft generalizations (e.g. Which MacBook for a developer) get closed as off-topic and/or opinion based.

Cheers and welcome to the site. I look forward to learning about USB C as well.

That is unless it's better asking on SuperUser (or other SE site) if there are any USB-C to USB-A adapters.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@aPyDeveloper  Just start editing - there's no penalty for making two or three tries to refine it. Each edit gets it entered into a queue where high reputation users can see what you're doing and vote to reopen. Don't ask a new question - just edit it heavily if needed. Once it's in shape and has details - we can land it on SU if needed.

I imagine we'll be seeing a lot of questions on this over the coming months.

Do we have a consensus on whether it would be on or off-topic until then?

It doesn't appear to require any NDA, so we wouldn't be breaking any agreements on that front, but it's beta so it might be all 'broken to heck' at any given point.

It's off-topic until final release. Breaking NDA is one thing, but that's not the main reason why pre-release questions are off-topic here. Things are broken in pre-release that won't be broken for the official release, and features can change, both in functionality and in method of use.

Ideally, answers here should not be subject to imminent change and ideally want to last for the foreseeable future: this isn't the case with most questions about pre-release software, hence the prohibition.

Is it widely available? Yes Do we entertain questions on iWork beta products (that have been beta for at least 18 months now)? Yes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I understand what you are saying, but Office:mac homepage promotes Office 2011, whereas iWork homepage promotes iWork for iCloud. iWork for iCloud might be in beta, but that's separate to beta.icloud.com, the actual pre-release site which would be off-topic? beta.icloud.com might be widely available, but it's still pre-release, and still off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From my point of view, the problem beta software under NDA and/or with a limited availability is that not everybody can participate in answering questions (which usually is also why publishers of such software offer their own support boards during the beta phase). Public betas without NDA which are open to everybody is as good as anything (think Google which used to put the beta label on everything).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would like to clarify that Outlook for Mac is not a beta release, it is RC at this time. While it is included in the bundle of Office for Mac 2015, it is available as a standalone product to Office365 customers. That would then make it available for discussion on the boards, correct?


















My question which you linked to is with regard to cross-posting: where the same user posts the same question to multiple sites across Stack Exchange. In this case, it's simply that the site scope of both sites allows the question to be on-topic in both places and has been asked on one site by one user and then on another site by a different user. This is not as a case for flagging as no moderator action is required in this situation.

In general, it is fine to copy a suitable answer from the original question and provide it as an answer to the second question. Use quote formatting to indicate that this is not your own work and provide a link to the source.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I considered including in the answer that I didn't think flagging was the correct answer for the reason you gave but figured it didn't matter since I couldn't flag anyway. I will edit my answer as suggested. Thank you! (I'd upvote as well as accept but I don't have the rep yet for that either.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This answer has lots of good advice, but let me nitpick one small part.  It feels like this answer is pushing BSMP to mark his answer as community wiki, but I don't think that is necessary or appropriate.  I can't see any reason to single out this particular answer to suggest that BSMP mark it as community wiki.  [BSMP's answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/176141/24154) would be fine as non-community wiki (and indeed I'd like to upvote it and ensure that BSMP gets rep for it). (If you were thinking of community wiki as a rep-denial mechanism, that's not what it's supposed to be used for.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@D.W. No, I don't wish to promote community wiki as a method of denying reputation from that answer—I simply wanted to bring awareness to the community wiki feature and say that the answer *can* be made community wiki. Perhaps my vocabulary choices could be made better? Feel free to suggest a revision (comments are fine, I know you can't suggest edits on meta) or add your own answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the elaboration.  Understandable.  I guess my reaction is to think that making a point of mentioning community wiki in this context somehow implies that community wiki is especially appropriate for this particular answer, and I can't see any reason why community wiki would be more appropriate for this answer than for any random answer on this site.  See e.g. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/  The only edit I'd suggest is to delete that sentence from your answer.  Maybe that's not a constructive suggestion, though...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@D.W. That's a fair solution, I've removed the reference and upvoted your answer. Thanks for pointing out discrepancies, always welcome. I don't really know what I was thinking when I mentioned community wiki :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for so understanding, grgarside.  Sounds like we are in violent agreement in all respects.  Hope BSMP will continue to contribute to the community!


















I think all of these specific questions should be open and on-topic.

Specifically, it's not part of the prohibited software listed as Pre-release, non-publicly available beta software and software granted only under an NDA

http://products.office.com/en-US/mac/mac-previewMicrosoft's Office for Mac 2016 Preview is publicly available.
It also is granted http://blogs.office.com/2015/03/05/office-2016-mac-preview/without an NDA.

Furthermore, the general category should be on-topic IMO. For example, I asked a question today about something Apple labels as beta.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/177722/is-it-possible-to-wipe-an-entire-icloud-photo-libraryIs it possible to wipe an entire iCloud Photo Library?




I'm legitimately stumped and at a standstill using this feature. I've opened two support tickets with Apple and it's been 5 days with no progress. I think there are good questions about beta software that can and should be asked. I'm of an opinion that we should close bad questions that are not precise. 

We should encourage questions about narrow topics or narrow windows in time as long as they are clear and precise. If there is confusion about beta status or versions, it's up to the asker to revise and phrase the question to meet community standards. 

This site aims to be the ultimate resource for community knowledge of products, and the benefits of beta exclusions seem to diminish the longer I see the site working day in and day out.

Keep in mind, Apple launched iWork for iCloud as beta in June 2013. In August 2013, it was available to anyone. Recently, they rolled it out to anyone with a Mac or PC and Safari 6.0.3 or later, Internet Explorer 9.0.8 or later, or Google Chrome 27.0.1 or later.

So, here we are 580 days after the general availability of the product and it's "still in beta" and turning down questions on a product that's in production that long seems odd to me just because it's "beta"

I'll step off this little soapbox now, but wanted to add more data than just "beta bad" or "beta good".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So we are to be fixing the bugs on a product that is not fully released. The preview is what its name says, a Preview only.  MS would not look at this page for bug reports, they offer that in "Look for the smiley face in the upper right corner of the application. Use that entry point to send feedback directly to our team." which version do we allow ? 15.8.1 and beyond ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Buscar웃 Yes - report for duty immediately to Redmond, WA. On a serious note, I see no reason to outlaw any versions of Office at this point in time. Preview, beta, external, supported, obsolete all are the same in my eyes. If the question is otherwise detailed and adheres to our guidelines, I feel they are helpful and in the spirit of Stack Exchange.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was not thinking of spirit not of outlaw, but of the flood of questions that mostly go unanswered, or say, did you get updated version 15.8.1 or something like that, which is completely useless.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We don't fix bugs here, we are a Q&A site which helps users to solve problems. Recommending an upgrade *is* a valid answer. If we really should get flooded with such questions, I'm sure somebody will volunteer to write a canonical answer to the "I've found a bug in a public beta release, what should I do" question so we close all further similar questions as duplicates.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I had a bug that I found someone else has asked a question for, and the answer is `Check your version - you are probably at x.y.z version and you need to upgrade to x.y.z version`, I would leave a happy camper knowing a new release was out that I wasn't aware of (even though I should be checking versions before seeking out help to begin with).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Qix however the point of stackexchnage is to provide questions and answers that are applicable to many people and not just a few or the OP at one point of time - (i.e. this is the correct meaning of the old close reason too localised)


















Edits that other people make to posts which are yours (both questions and answers) will cause an edit notification to show in your inbox.

                                 

However, these notifications are not sent for minor edits. Edits need to be substantiative enough for the system to deem it necessary to notify you. For more information, see Meta.SE:


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/202359/no-notification-was-received-for-an-edit-to-a-postNo notification was received for an edit to a post



  In order to reduce noise sent to users, we only notify when "substantive" changes are happening on their posts.
  
  There are a few rules in how "substantive" is defined, but typically one of the following should be enough to trigger a message:
  
  
  edit to a question title
  the edit in the post body should be over a threshold
  the edit in code sections should be over another threshold
  
  
  The threshold varies from site to site. Retagging only is not considered "substantive" hence will not send notification. 


Notifications are not sent to the user who asked a question if an answer to their question is edited.

Since the FAQ and help section state that questions about Pre-release, non-publicly available beta software and software granted only under an NDA are off-topic, should any or all of these be on-topic while they say "beta"?

No certainly don't ask that here as meta is for discussing the site. Asking why you might or might not ask something on main is exactly the point here.

For opinion and discussion on the main site - we have the blog (where someone needs to write an opinion piece and then the discussion happens in the comments) and the [chat] rooms.

Now, if you can distill your opinion question down to how to learn about technology, that's on topic on the main site. So for example. I have a Retina MacBook Pro and I run certain apps. I might want to ask how I could measure the performance of my current workload so I can decide between the MacBook or MacBook Pro both of just announced.

Basically - by analyzing my needs, documenting them and then asking how to learn - the question becomes less about opinion and more about objective facts and knowledge. Boom - the question would not be primarily opinion based if you do some work to nail down what you're really asking.

With data, you're not just another person with an opinion. (not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_DemingW. Edwards Deming)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So I could ask if a MacBook or a MacBook air will be better for me to buy by showing my CPU usage and the Applications I use daily?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Possibly. It depends much on the delivery. You also are fighting an uphill battle when asking what boils down to "which new computer is best for me" since there are so, so, so many bad iterations of that question that have aged very poorly on this site. Your call if you want to try. worst case, you get lots of down votes, people behave badly and/or you delete the question if it's not fixable or what you expected.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, Thanks. Would it be better if I ask 'Will the new MacBook have enough power for what I do'? That way I am not asking whats better, MacBook or MacBook Air, I am asking if it can achieve what I want it to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even that is tricky - we use to write OS X code om machines that are 10x slower and could do the work - some people now use 6 year old machines with no issues. It depends how much you want speedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks. I have decided to ask how to view the current frequency my CPU runs at (since the frequency is never the same with turbo charge) so I can tell for my self and it isn't asking 'is this better' or 'will it cope'. I also got the answer I wanted asking it that way.


















My opinion is that they should be acceptable (and not off-topic) much in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1119/despite-the-general-rule-to-not-answer-questions-about-beta-products-should-wethe same way Siri and Messages were. While they are are technically "beta", I think it is largely in name only as the general public has easy access to them from the default panel in www.iCloud.com.

I think they also come very close to fitting into the FAQ criteria as they really aren't pre-release, and are public available.

I believe they used to be only accessible from beta.icloud.com in which case, I think it would be different, as it would more more fit into the "pre-release" clause.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Add Google betas to this exception - they can go for some time as well. Normal; betas have a projected end date and will become a release not just the developer can't be bothered to plan or decide to remove it at a whim (If a beta none can complain as they should not be using it for anything valuable)


















I asked a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/159369/how-much-difference-between-i5-and-i7-13-macbook-pro-2014-especially-for-xcodequestion about the difference that processor architectures make to compiler performance. I asked with a lot of supporting detail to make it possible for someone who knew facts to be able to say X feature of the processor directly helps compilation and I tried to avoid simple comparative "opinion-based" wording.

Still, it was closed.

We seem to have an increasing tendency to close questions as "opinion based" when I see many of them as being more, the closer doesn't know enough about the topic to know if there will be relevant facts so assumes the question leads to just opinions. Is this just "moderation activity for ego sake?"

(Yes I looked at the profile of the person who closed it and they don't seem to be an authority in this area.)

It was a real issue I was trying to get answered and I put significant work into technical preparation to seed the answers. The question just won me a silver badge for the 2,5000 views it's had so I was just reminded of how annoyed I was by the closure.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Closure due "primarily opinion-based" seems more like ignorance of moderator - a trend?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think there is a site trend of poorly executed hardware shopping questions being placed on hold until they can be turned into clear and objective opportunities for reopening. Why attack the messenger instead of edit the post in question or ask here for community help to make things better? Are you looking for some measure of help with using the site of just interested in publishing your thoughts and venting your dissatisfaction? I enjoy helpng with the former and welcome the latter as long as discussion remains kind and civil.


















That question reads like you musing about benchmarks and their applicability to your specific work requirements.

Closing a question doesn't mean it needs to stay closed; it means that, in its current form, it isn't a question that will lead to a clear and canonical answer. You'll get a bunch of "well I tried this" and "maybe this will work" type stuff which is wholly not the kind of Q&A site this happens to be.

Closing a question means it needs more work.

Even your follow-up semi-answer, semi-comment comment frames how not-a-question  your question was:


  I thought it might be useful to add a comment on how well the 13" has worked out. The 16GB RAM helps as does the SSD so it seems faster then my iMac most of the time when compiling or running AppCode. I have noticed a tendency to hog the more if compiling - try to avoid doing big builds and lots of web browsing simultaneously.


That's not an answer, that's a single experience and some speculation.

There might well be a reasonable question in what you posted, but as it stands I agree with the moderator who closed it: it's not a question that can be answered in any other way that would lead to a useful, guiding response. Really, the only answer that can be given for "How much difference between i5 and i7 13" Macbook Pro 2014 especially for XCode & Visual Studio compilation?" is:


  It depends entirely on what, specifically, you're trying to do with those IDEs.


Full stop.

You might say the benchmarks provide as much illumination as possible on the differences and that's about it. Neither of those tools have standard benchmarking suites behind them so there isn't any empirical result you can point to to understand their behavioural differences on the two difference machines.

As for your comment about the moderator: the site is community moderated, as are all Stack Exchange sites. The question was brought to the attention of the moderators by flags from your peers. It was not a lone decision.

I share your assessment that the question most probably is not a duplicate. Nevertheless right now it's difficult to understand what the question is about actually.

Your flag was declined with


  Please comment or edit the post to explain why it's not duplicate. If we were to reopen it, it would need to be closed as too broad/unclear 


From looking at the question in question (sic), I agree with the moderator declining the flag. The question can be read either as "how do I recover from a "iPhone is disabled" situation" or as a "how do I recover forgotten Apple ID/password", also it's (at least to me) not clear how these two statements even fit together (AFAIK Apple ID/password are not required to re-enable an iPhone via iTunes after too many wrong password attempts). This means that just reopening the question would have it closed again as "unclear" rather quickly.

It's worth keeping in mind that this site (as well as all the other SE sites) is mainly community moderated. So in this case please go ahead, tidy up the question and leave a comment for the OP on what you did and why you did it.

PS: And thanks for bringing the issue up on Meta!

Also, there's a small chance that the asker isn't so clear as we think and they really just need general troubleshooting advice. Thanks again for asking for clarification. I was limited in the message I sent when I declined your flag to have the question reopened by fiat as opposed to community moderation tools.

Asking a new question seems less likely to help the site until other avenues are exhausted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike - agree. Unfortunately i don't know the good answer (only know than the original is wrong). Therefore asked the **variant** question - what could be ok - but got closed. Got closed one question - nothing horrible happens - only want point to the fact than moderators really should have "sensitive finger on the gun trigger" - and think twice before applies an "diamod close". :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think a comment, with some details, is warranted on the accepted answer in this case. Especially since, given the nature of the question, relying on that answer could prove fairly bad if the user isn't running something like Time Machine to be able to recover from the deletion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jm666 why not undelete your second question and let's edit the question since you're quite convinced there's room for a new situation / clarity - closing it as dupe helps when multiple search terms get you to the correct place. Also bounties work well for getting an updated answer.


















You initially asked

It is safe delete everything bellow /private/var/folders/?
Another (more important) question - has the OS X something as rc.6, e.g. an shell script what is running when changing the run level to 6 - e.g. at every reboot? (Or rc.0 at every boot), to where I could add the rm?
Is safe clean the /var/folders/* at every reboot? (asking because i could imagine than some update utility could use it...).

There are several problems with this question which may have lead to it being put on hold in the next hours/days:

there are (at least) two questions at once, leading to a close due to being too broad or unclear what you are asking
part of the question have come up before (and being answered already), leading to a close as a duplicate

I've decided to follow up on the second option (as there was no reference at all to that question in your text), I also recommended to ask a new question to cover the "can I safely clean the folders on reboot".
If you think the answer to the original question is wrong, the best course of action would be to add a comment to that answer (you have more than enough reputation for this), post a new answer on your own or do both.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I checked your answers. You're an good unix-guru with a deep knowledge of the system, bash and like - so - i'm **pretty sure** that you know yourself, than the answer **is wrong**. Therefore I was surprised by your close. As I told above - nothing horrible happens - maybe next time, instead of the close vote - you could EDIT the question - to be better. Thank you for answer. accept - case closed. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question was put *on hold* due to the reasons outlined above, *not* due to any technical merits (or lack thereof) of either the question or the existing answer to a related question. Usually editing an unclear question to improve it is a community effort.


















There's no need to delete and repost your answer just because you've included your email address in an image.

Whilst the revision history will show the information, the correct procedure is to flag the answer for moderator attention and request that the revision be removed from the revision history. Whilst moderators themselves are unable to do this themselves, they are able to elevate your request to those who can.

Deleting your answer, whilst removing it from public view, still allows it to be viewed by moderators, both those who are elected moderators (with the diamonds) and those with the moderator tools privilege such as me.

Note that editing your post within the 5 minute grace period will not leave a revision in the revision history, so if you make your change fast enough, there is no need for moderator intervention (unless you wish the image to be removed from i.stack.imgur.com too). You posted the answer at 04:17:52 and deleted it at 04:18:27; simply editing it at that point wouldn't have created a revision in the revision history.

If that were done, then only imgur.com would need to be purged. I've also added an answer as it's best for people to 1) edit to purge 2) request removal directly to the site via **contact us** links at the bottom of all pages 3) flag moderators as an FYI as opposed to the first action for help

Kudos for asking so constructively.  I think your reaction/approach was entirely reasonable.

In general we tend not to like link-only answers.  There are several reasons.  For instance, links often die.  However, those reasons probably don't apply here.  For instance, it seems hard to imagine a situation where Stackoverflow disappears from the Internet but Ask Different remains.  That said, it never hurts to supplement your answer by adding a summary of the main idea from the other answer you are linking to, so the best solution is probably to provide a link to the detailed answer on Stackoverflow and add a short summary to your answer here.

It is OK to copy from someone else's answer, as long as you provide suitable attribution and link to that other answer.

The only place where I disagree with https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2391/24154grgarside's excellent answer -- and I admit it's a small nit -- is that I think there's no need to mark your answer as community wiki.  Community wiki is only appropriate in those very rare cases where http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/massive collaboration from the community is needed; this is extremely rare and I don't see why it would apply to your situation.  I would suggest you leave your answer as an ordinary answer (don't make it community wiki) -- I think your answer is helpful, and I'd prefer to be able to upvote it and have you receive the rep for your useful, well-written, well-researched answer.  If you want to remove community wiki status, you can flag your answer for moderator attention and ask them to remove the community wiki status.

Thank you for your valuable contributions to Ask Different.  I hope you will keep contributing!

That way you’re not promoting yours above others. Cheers and mahalo!


















I think there are two edges to this sword:


The minimum requirements are really that. Absolute minimum - I really like steering one question on the site to be just that. Apple authors first party tools to create iOS apps and they are Xcode. If your Mac runs Xcode - it can develop apps. Full stop.
Opinions on what makes a reasonable minimum setup will vary. In fact, it has to vary. A student in a country that has no Apple stores, perhaps limited access to the internet very rightly could want to know what is needed to program an iOS app. They might rightly not care about the latest and greatest and would need an answer taking their requirements into factor. Similarly, someone with three Macs and a budget might very rightly consider hardware that meets the minimum requirements not a solution even worth entertaining. Their answer would rightly not care about budget and really be asking about workflow and efficiency.


For the good of the site - I want to find and identify the question that best handles case 1. It would link to Apple's Xcode page and perhaps the minimum requirements page to run OS X. It would then be a resource to teach people the baseline and/or a place to hilight alternative answers covering non-first party tools.

At that point, we have a solid baseline and a link to meta with "the one" or "the few" canonical questions. From there, we can then entertain and/or close questions of the nature of "I need storyboards and home kit to develop iOS apps and debug them" vs "I'm a student and I need a project to spend 40 hours over the next three months - will my Uncle's hand-me-down iMac running 10.6.8 and Xcode 3 be enough to program my jailbroken iPod stuck at iOS 5.1.2"

If this all makes sense - the work will be for 10k users to identify and help isolate or edit questions to serve as #1 and not get stuck changing a type #2 question. That will a) irritate the OP b) be more of a mess in general since opinions have to vary based on budget and goals. If we can't find a good #1 question, then you or I will need to ask it and leave all the existing questions to serve role #2.

You've never been able to single-handedly approve suggested edits (except on your posts).

Suggested edits require two approve or reject votes before being committed. If you are the first reviewer (or second if you disagreed with the first) then another review vote is still required.

With regard to https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/101814your last review, you were the first to approve it and you couldn't have approved it solely yourself as it wasn't suggested on one of your posts. Therefore it required a second person to approve it for it to be approved, which is what occurred.

This isn't the first time you've approved something first; https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/38462this one was approved first by you then by me. In the same vein, https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/51182you rejected this one first, but it wasn't rejected until the second person rejected it.

Sounds good! I was using very similar wording, also inspired by the Stack Overflow close reason, as a custom close reason in the free-form box on the close dialog.

I like the wording as it stands: concise and objectified, providing sufficient information for the OP to understand not just why their question was closed but why it was closed, as well as a nice link which I rarely included myself. Seems perfect!

An official close reason for this would lead to more consistency across the community.

Since the votes here are quite low - please ping me or ask a new meta question if the votes swing or anyone wants an edit to the wording.


















Often when I return to a question I find my comment deleted. Yes I know the purpose of the comment field, so no need to lecture me on that.

Most of the time I just think I just forgot (result of getting senile, which is a possibility considering the advanced age), and did not make a comment in first place, but quickly I am coming to a conclusion it was there but it is deleted.

Is there a way to get notified when my comment was deleted. 

Is there a common guide when to delete the comments?

Since that can only be done by a moderator it should be easy to be notified and the reason for it, so to improve.

Here is a https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/179369/46541sample of most recent comments (none was deleted so far) and yes it contains potential answer. So what is wrong with that if at all?

Look, I have been here for 2 Yr and very active. So I know my 5 mods I am occasional dealing with. I am bringing a serious complaint to address. Since ONLY mods can delete the comment, how about letting someone with 17+k know when Flag is showing, just out of common curtsey and respect! Is that to much to ask ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The only way to notify somebody about deleted comments is to add another comment mentioning this somebody. Given the nature of comments and the fact that comments usually get deleted for not being necessary/relevant any longer, this would kind of defeat the whole idea of deleting them in the first place. Also, deleting flagged comments is something we do based on content, not on the user who wrote them. I often don't even look from which user the comment is coming from (it's not relevant at all).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to dig deeper, there are a bunch of discussions and feature-requests on this on meta.stackexchange.com.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*"how about letting someone with 17+k know when Flag is showing"* [I believe this comment on Meta.SE](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252690/what-privilege-should-30k-users-get/252703#comment825187_252703) addresses the community consensus on the association between reputation and moderation skills. Such a correlation should never be made.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Considering the very low popularity I will go ahead and delete this question and consider using the Self Destruct app (at least then I feel like been in control)  http://stackapps.com/q/6316/20391



















  Yes I know the purpose of the comment field, so no need to lecture me on that.


I would disagree that this is the case. The question your asking here is proof of that.

Comments are intentionally disposable. From https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19756/how-do-comments-workHow do comments work?:


  Comments exist so that users can talk about questions and answers
  without posting new answers that do not actually answer their parent
  questions. Comments are often used to ask for clarification on,
  suggest corrections to and provide meta-information about posts.
  
  Comments are intentionally short, having maximum length of 600
  characters, and allow only limited markup. URLs in comments
  automatically become hyperlinks. Each user may post only one comment
  every 15 seconds.
  
  Comments are disposable: unlike posts, there's no revision history,
  and they can be deleted without warning by their authors, by
  moderators, and in response to flags.


As for why your comments are disappearing, if they weren't deleted by you, they have been flagged by other users or a moderator. Again, from that meta post:


  Comments that are flagged by multiple users are deleted automatically.
  The number of flags needed is based on the comment's score. It
  currently takes "3 + (Score / 3)" flags to delete a comment.
  
  Moderators can delete any comment, or purge all comments from a post.


Specifically, from that meta post, I draw your attention to:


  You should not expect them to be around forever: Once a clarification
  has been made, an edit added to the post to include new information,
  or the issue in the comment is otherwise resolved, it is subject to
  deletion. In reality, many obsolete or chatty comments remain
  untouched due to the high volume of comments posted, but this does not
  mean that they can't or shouldn't be deleted in the future.


I would characterize your commenting behaviour on the site as being "overly chatty" and thus you see a high number of your comments removed.

In any case, you shouldn't be making comments as a permanent record of anything on Stack Exchange sites. They are to be "used to ask for clarification on, suggest corrections to and provide meta-information about posts" -- not for providing witty remarks, "thank you" type posts or for long-drawn out back-and-forth discussions on questions and answers.

Specially in cases where they exceed the limit due to question and answer. Since you know when my comment was flagged, can I at least get that info, it might help me to constrain my self (or not). I do make a lot of silly ones and have no problem with them been removed, but many others are a surprise to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Buscar웃 getting notified when a comment is deleted is a feature request. You should take that to meta.stackexchange.com and ask for it there.


















I delete a lot of comments. Usually they are flagged for deletion. There's no way I know to track it. It would help us as well - if we ended up deleting 100 comments from one user where there was a pattern, it would be nice to be able to see that and address it head on and with data as opposed to "human recollection" which can be faulty at best. 


Let's spin your feature request off as a separate question.


As to when I recall deleting comments from you in particular - when you are answering the question in a comment - it often goes, especially if that answer has been provided by you or another. Please don't do that going forward - if you are trying to clarify the question - do that in the comments. If the author needs to troubleshoot or you know how to troubleshoot that - make an answer stating that here's how you would troubleshoot the situation.

Since comments are never meant to last - there's no notification of edits or deletions. There's no wiki revision history. If you are putting information into a comment that merits that level of information - that's a good sign you should be asking on meta or chatting or editing the post or just making an answer.

Without looking into specifics it's hard to know if I'm the deleter or if other moderators are also deleting comments.

I'm not looking to lecture you or anyone on comments, but I'd disagree with the "I know the purpose of the comment field" since it's often misunderstood and often subjective what's harmful in comments. I think we all use them for entertainment, mockery and disagreement from time to time - especially when we are new users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The comments I enjoy most (both writing and reading) and probably the least in accordance with the officially sanctioned purpose of comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That said, it is probably appropriate to delete them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel everything in moderation is a-okay.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@daniel - well said. I wonder if there's a way to make that official policy. Kind of "adopt" your favorite comment or "this comment" is a meta comment where the normal rules are backwards...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let me clarify the "answering the question in comment field". Often I am not 100% sure of the absolute answer. In the effort to clarify the question I make a suggestion to try this or try that. Once I get a positive respond I delete the comment and make it a answer. Looks to me like a clean way to do it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Buscar웃 That's totally fine (and one of the ideas behind the comment function). Moving discussions to chat (assuming the asking user has enough reputation to join chat) is also an option in this case.


















No
No, there is not a way to get notified when your comment was deleted.
No, there is not a common guide when to delete the comments.
Comments are temporary. They frequently get deleted, and are designed to not endure. If a comment is removed, that dos not necessarily mean you did something wrong (although sometimes it does). Comments are like the grass of the fields. The grass withers, the flowers fade. Sic transit gloria mundi.

See my answer below. Your comment can be deleted by the system if it is flagged by community members. Three flags on a comment with no up votes and it's gone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Buscar This distinction by Ian is very important as certain comments with certain phrases can be insta-deleted with a single flag.


















I recently flagged 19 comments as too chatty or obsolete and have had all of them declined.

The comments were of the following nature:


+1 for the explanation.
I guess you mean the shift key? Also, link-only answers are not very helpful if the link ever stops working!
@LarsEbert OMG what a spell error :)
Much better now +1
Thank you, finally the problem is solved.
+1. Excellent answer!


Why were these comment flags declined? The comments are completely superfluous and as comments are ephemeral why should these comments not be removed?

My post flag accuracy is over 98% with almost 1500 flags, but my comment flag accuracy is only 35% with only 80 flags.

Why are my comment flags declined? At one point, I had a few flags declined for comments on the same post, which were then removed anyway later.

There seems to be a lot of these around at the moment; questions on cheats/hacks for Clash of Clans, but without ever mentioning that name directly.

I'm seeing them across all the SE sites I visit.

It's kind of spam with no visible purpose. It contains no link, just some vague waffle requesting how to cheat in some way or other

e.g.  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179988/clash-of-stone-cheathttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179988/clash-of-stone-cheat

They are usually tagged with something irrelevant too.

Do we flag as Spam or just vote to close as off-topic?
I understand being flagged as spam affects the poster in some greater way than just having their question closed as off-topic, so I wanted some kind of quorum on how to treat these.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Flag these as Spam?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/what-are-the-spam-and-offensive-flags-and-how-do-they-work, http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10582/what-is-a-closed-or-on-hold-question


















I've added a close reason and linked it to the "How to ask a good question" article in the help center. It needs a second moderator to review the wording and approve the change.

The intention is not to broadly rule all hardware recommendations off topic. They are valuable when they are phrased to include:


research shown
intent to learn how to shop or measure or decide or understand
not simply looking for someone to do the work for the OP
broadly applicable (if possible)


If there is confusion how to use this, I'll gladly respond to a meta post with example questions that are bad and should be closed for this reason as well as example questions of good examples that should not be closed. I think the close voters are already voting this way and the link to the FAQ will help people with legitimate but lazily worded questions get their intent edited into the post so we can reopen them with a minimum discussion, delay and fuss.

I specifically like https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254393/these descriptions from the main meta:


"Recommendation question" is shorthand for "you didn't describe a problem, you just asked for a list of things."
First, let's be clear: all questions are recommendation questions. You describe a problem, folks recommend solutions: potential fixes for a bug, possible algorithms, libraries, work-arounds, etc. - So when folks talk about "recommendation questions", they're actually talking about questions where it's difficult or impossible to know - as the answerer or a reader - whether one answer provides a better solution than another

I think just because a question can be answered by recommending hardware doesn't necess make it a bad question, but many questions that ask for hardware recommendations are, in fact, bad questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel Yes - yes - yes. Sorry if my words were confusing - I'm looking to make it easy to handle bad questions and point people looking for legitimate help to the resources to get that question in shape for answering.


















Jin - please see if the line spacing can be harmonized on this post (and those like it). I think the edit icon introduced a gap in the last line.

Recently, I found a user that had a reputation under 50, so he couldn't comment. Instead, he put the comment into an answer, which people shouldn't do. I flagged the answer. After I rechecked, one of the admins or moderators deleted the "answer" and put it into a comment which had the author as the person under 50 reputation. Did a moderator do that? Can moderators do it? Or was it some community admin?

There are many reasons why this may occur.


If you've handled a post outside of a queue yourself, then you won't be able to handle it inside a queue.
If you've handled a post in a queue that requires someone else (or multiple other people) to handle it too, then you won't see the review task any more but it'll be shown in the count in the top bar, for other users.
For users with <5k, tag wiki suggested edits count towards the number in the top bar but won't be shown to you.

Great question - Lets pick apart just one of the short questions. Some short questions are so clear and so useful that they work excellently. Could you ask a second question here on meta with the exact wording of one of these "short questions" if my general help below isn't useful to your needs.

From the https://apple.stackexchange.com/tagstags page:


  photos x 590
  
  Photographs and photography


And:


  photos.app x 81
  
  The Apple photo manager and editor and successor to iPhoto and Aperture. Introduced in 2015.


Making photos a synonym of photos.app has the potential to mis-tag 590 questions now. Questions that pre-date the existence of the Photos app from Apple and have nothing to do with the tool.

Our convention has been to use .app on tags to denote the Apple product with the noun.

Violating this convention in this particular case does not, in my opinion, sound like a good idea.

Over time, I believe people will get the difference and only tag things photos.app when it's about that app specifically and use the generic tag in most cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike You have too good a view of people - I think most will just hit the first tag that matches e.g. photo - using photography will force them to  make a choice. Most people seem not to spend time learning conventions - in general in computing I jayvee found that conventions work only when backed up with tools or processes to enforce themb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark I was vague - the people that will care are the editors that make the majority of the edits here. No one will change most of the wrong uses, but when a question gets lots of views, that detail will bug someone so much that they make the change and all the high quality/high vote questions about photos.app will get tagged correctly. (IMO of course ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See this edit http://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/106228 everything correct but Photos.app


















Based on Ian C.'s response:

Would it be possible to rename https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photosphotos to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photographyphotography and then create a new https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photosphotos tag that was a synonym to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photos.appphotos.app? That would:


Continue the convention of using '.app' for Apple products.
Maintain existing and future photography-related questions with their own tag, that does not conflict with the name of a (new) Apple product.
Enable most new contributors who are likely to just enter https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photosphotos to (via a synonym) get their questions tagged correctly.

I wouldn't call it unfair, it's just one of the rules valid on all StackExchange sites. One of the reasons that users are required to have at least some reputation before voting is to actually increase the quality of the votes (and to prevent spammers from creating a bunch of accounts and voting each other up).

If you look at https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputationhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation, getting to 15 reputation isn't all that hard (either post a good answer to one of the questions or invest some time to improve 8 posts by editing them).

There's a lot of good information and legitimate criticism of Apple for making this hard/unclear and lacking a support mechanism other than filling out a web form. On the flip side, it's hard to understand how this happens if you didn't sign up for the wrong region intentionally and/or falsify your account details at some point. Also, walking away from less than $1 is hard to complain about - even privately - when you can find some game to zero out your store credit in the majority of the cases.

I'd like some extra eyes and criticism if my closes need to be adjusted and/or some questions really merged to get all the correct answers easily searchable. Since merging questions is something moderators cannot undo, I'd rather be sure we have good chains of close before taking that step.

Once this is sorted, we can enter the remaining questions as https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2418/where-is-the-list-of-canonical-questions-stored-for-ask-differentcanonical ones for the site.

I'm actually in the process of moving to Canada, and while I want to keep my US iTunes account for various reasons, if I didn't, there was nothing I did wrong other than meet, fall in love with and marry a Canadian.


















Appropriate to ask for advice on upgrading on this site?

For instance, if a user says "I have this computer was set up a, and $500 to spend, what are the best upgrades to spend my money on?", will this be allowed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Upgrade related questions appropriate?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/


















I'm going to go with "no" here -- it's a shopping question as you phrased it. Any recommendations that involve spending money are highly time-limited.

If you remove the dollars and simply ask:


  If I was going to upgrade my computer, in what order should I upgrade components to get the most performance for my money?


That would be slightly less contentious question and probably one I wouldn't vote to close as it will stay true much longer than a I-have-dollars-to-spend question.

If running say VMNs you might need to get the RAM up to a high number if compiling or video editing I'll suspect an SSD. If just compiling then a fusion drive might be best.

Indeed, I did. I disagree it's unanswerable. It's not a great question. But it's not off topic.


















There's a full guide to searching at https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/searching/help/searching.

Exact match searches are accomplished by enclosing the string in ". Punctuation is excluded from search strings, even when using exact match.

If all else fails, you can always search using Google with the site:apple.stackexchange.com parameter.

Google does the same, unfortunately. I think it's just one of those edge-cases where I really would have been better-off following the old farmer's advice when asked directions…"Well, you don't want to start from here." ;)


















Questions that highlight shortcomings or flaws in Apple's products, especially recently as the usability and performance of Apple's software has declined, are often down-voted or voted closed, suggesting that Ask Different is not the place to ask such questions.

Is there an appropriate place to ask them?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where should questions that point out flaws of shortcomings of Apple products be posted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you link to any? In general, rants are not well received here; if the point of the "question" is to highlight shortcomings or flaws in anything, it's not really a question. If you are having a problem with an Apple product and you are looking for a way to solve that problem, that's very on topic here. If you're looking to complain, that doesn't really belong on any Stack Exchange site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel: Yes, sorry: [here's one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/186511/4395), voted to close. It's an honest question describing a real experience I'm having.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel: And the reference to Apple's website is not a rant or out of context: the front quick interactions as a core feature (and their own apps seem to deliver it for the most part); but third-party apps are (for me, and other's I've spoke to, at least) are certainly not. This could be simply because (a) developers are not using the API correctly; or (b) that I need to configure something to improve performance; or (c) it is a limitation of the (1.0) platform that is well known — or something else. Ask Different really should be the place to find out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to vote to close that as well. It's not clear you are seeking user level things you can control as opposed to how to program a specific app how to load faster. If it's the latter, you will need to explain that you're not looking for code level assistance and instead seeking to understand how the iPhone and Watch Apps work in conjunction to be perform certain tasks in certain wall clock times. Also, I don't see that as out of line and quite mild if it's in fact a criticism of Apple or their products. Also, be specific, what is "my apps" in your post and avoid being too broad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5broad being what if the optimization for App A makes App B even slower? You are implicitly assuming that the cause of delay is identical in all when it might not be the case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike: I've listed several examples, but it is the case really for *all* of my apps. And I don't thing you are treating this question the way you would one that was not critical of Apple. The criticisms you raise could be applied to just about any of the many useful and accepted questions here. Is it really not clear that I'm asking whether there's some setting I ought to change; or that a possible answer is "that doesn't happen to any of my apps", or "I have that problem the apps you list but not others", etc.?


















I feel Ask Different is an excellent place to criticize Apple (or any other company) as long as you follow the rules for asking a good question. The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askHow to Ask portion of the help guide explains how to research your issue, document that research and relate it to a practical problem you face.

For example, if your post asks basically for opinions why Apple did X - it should be closed.

If your post asks "How do I do X given that here is how things work and this is the documentation on how it works and it's preventing me from doing Y" then it belongs and also deserves lots of votes up.

Also, keep in mind that https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicthings like hardware shopping, code level programming and general whining are off topic. Specific whining is on-topic as long as the rest of the quality guidelines for the question are met successfully and it's https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/be-nicepolite and not rude, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate

It's a very straightforward question about which of the intrinsic data sources used by Health provide the most accurate measurements of steps taken and distance walked, and yet it has 3 close votes and a downvote. To me this clearly speaks to something wrong with the community here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@raxacoricofallapatorius You showed no research so people are free to down vote if they feel that or if they feel it's not useful. You're welcome to your opinion of the community here, but perhaps you're taking things personally. Also, if people comment constructively and then receive retaliatory down votes, they will be less likely to comment going forward and instead just vote or refrain from commenting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What would "research" look like for this question? It's a straightforward question about the measurable objective capabilities of the data sources for specific activities. (And "retaliatory down votes" is coming from where?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@raxacoricofallapatorius Research (for instance) would be linking to the Apple Watch and iPhone user manuals and explaining you looked if there is a calibration or accuracy setting. Basically, document what you did to try and solve the issue yourself. Votes would be from you against commenters or answerers. It's odd that no one is trying to help you with comments and just voting to close and down vote your posts. I was trying to guess why you are not getting support from the community. Forgive me if you felt bad by the suggestion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You've provided yet another example of this issue with [your recent edit](http://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/186706/revisions). It *is* "oddly circular" to have the Heath app as a datasource for the Health app. What can that mean? Explaining that is clearly an essential part of any complete answer to that question. Think about it: without such a clarification a valid answer might me "The Health app is the best source (for data used by the Heath app)". In the absence of an explanation of the apparent circularity, what would that mean and how would such an answer be helpful?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But I do think your edit puts a finer on it: there are users here for whom any implication that something might be off with Apple's products causes an allergic reaction, so that a perfectly clear and simple and widely useful question provides an allergic reaction because of one word: "oddly".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@raxacoricofallapatorius My opinion is you don't explain yourself well in questions. You have detailed comments as to how others are wrong. How would I differentiate you from a troll based on your actions the last few days on the site? (n.b I'm not convinced you are here to troll, just observing the behavior patterns I'm seeing and the worry I begin to have) I'd like you to have fair access, but the net votes on your last 16 posts isn't encouraging for a user with your reputation and length of engagement with the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll see what I can accomplish with questions that spell things out more, but  I don't have issues like this on other SE sites or other Web fora, and users here seem to have no difficulty drawing the necessary implications from other concise questions that don't spell every thing out in detail.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the recent spike in negative votes, that's simply a consequence of the recent release of two products (Photos and Watch) that — I'm far from the only person with this view —have a lot of issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Here's [another example](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/186694/4395): an even more straightforward question with a completely straightforward answer with one flaw: it is critical of an Apple product.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And [another](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/190018/4395). Someone doesn't like me, I think.


















I have read about the community user. It is a bot that pulls old questions out, does site chores, owns unregistered users questions, protects when questions attract "me too!" answers.

But the profile page doesn't mention anything about approving and rejecting edits. How does that work? Does a bot do that, or is it a person? How does it know if it is a good edit or not?

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1611/community-accepted-crappy-suggested-editHere is a similar question, though the answer is not really what I wanted. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How does the Community bot work when it approves or rejects my edits?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Community User always is a bot.

I know you need at least 2 approves to accept the edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the link anyway. Though I still would like to know, how it decides to reject or approveb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The user approving the edit has >2000 reputation, so he can approve edits directly (see http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit). The community user in this case merely takes note of this fact and removes the edit from the queue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So the community basically takes the place of another voter? So when there is one approve for longer, the Community substitutes to remove the edit from queue? And please make an answer for this question so I can accpet this. Thanks


















The Community User always is a bot. See https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19738/who-is-the-community-userthis post on Meta SE for some more details.

Also, the profile page for that user is quite descriptive:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community?tab=profilehttps://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community?tab=profile

If you find something that isn't documented there, we can open a new question to have that addressed.

As for https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/109411this edit, the user approving it has >2000 reputation, so he can approve edits directly (see apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit). The community user in this case merely takes note of this fact and removes the edit from the queue (which is logged/registered as another approving edit).

A question shouldn't be critical of anything. If a question sounds like a rant, it doesn't belong here.

If you are having a problem with a product, a question about how to solve the problem is certainly in order. Complaining about the product is not.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/186511/4395first example you linked is currently open and has a positive score; it seems to be well received. You are trying to solve a problem of making your apps launch faster. The question could be a hidden rant ("This is too slow! Apple Watch suxx!"), but if you are actually interested in answers, this is totally a legit and on-topic question here.

In https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/186694/4395this example, it is unclear whether the intent of the post is to determine whether user identity detection is a feature of Apple Watch (and the consensus among the answers is that it is not), or to complain that the language of the ad is misleading. If the first is the purpose of the post, the post isn't "critical of an Apple product"; it's just trying to find information.

If the purpose of the post is really to complain that the ad uses imprecise language, no one here comes to the site to hear people whine. If users think that's what a question is for, they will often vote against it.

The fact that you categorize the aforelinked post as "critical of an Apple product" (or actually of the ad for an Apple product) tells me that you might have the intent to rant here.

There's no problem with not liking Apple products (or Microsoft products, or Google products, or…), but this site isn't the place to complain or praise; it's a place to look for solutions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That categorization is an interpretation that seems to be being imposed on the questions I'm asking, rather that the intent of the questions. In the example you cite, the purpose is really exactly what the question is asking: to find out if the watch recognizes me. It's not a trap, any more than [this question](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/258012) is. Here, I fear the latter would have been perceived as some kind oblique attempt to "whine" about or "criticize" Apple products.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it is not the intent of your questions to rant about bad products, but rather to solve actual problems you face (including by bad products), then your issue is half solved. You just need to make sure the wording of your questions focuses on the problem you want to solve and doesn't sound like you're complaining but not really looking for a solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If a question is seeking a solution to an actual problem, even if it gets closed, if it gets edited to make the actual problem clear, it will be reopened. People are, of course, free to vote as they wish, but there's no problem with questions that end up pointing out flaws in Apple products (and I know there are many!).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't worry, I'm not imagining that there is some kind of conspiracy or malice here, I just see a pattern. I will do what I can to clarify my questions, but it does feel a bit like one has to walk  eggshells here to avoid questions that are perceived as "critical", or "whining", or even "trolling" — and now "ranting".


















Votes on comments are more similar to favs on Twitter/likes on FB in a way. The only functionality behind comment votes actually is that in case there are a lot of comments on a post, the ones with higher upvotes get displayed by default, not the chronologically oldest.

Question is slightly different than https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2429What happens with deleted comments, but the answers given there apply to comment "votes" as well. Comments aren't guarateed to persist, so voting on them doesn't impact your reputations etc. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the response. Thoughts: 1) Though the Facebook & Twitter comparison is accurate, the exact difference is that I would receive a notification if someone “liked” or “faved” my comment.  2) The feature would have nothing to do with reputation, or any explicit incentive - I simply think it’d be a beneficial that one be notified for a positive contribution to the community, whatever the circumstances. 3) I appreciate the linked to Q&A - it’s dispelled some of my previous held notions about the persistence of comments, despite the fact my belief in the feature req. holds. Cheers.


















tbh, I'd like a downvote option on comments too; for the truly idiotic, yet not actually offensive ones - to quickly push them out of contention. 

Theoretical wild example:-
OP wants to expand a drive partition.
First comment is 'Wipe your drive, reinstall your OS'

It's not offensive; it's not 'strictly wrong', you could do it that way if you were so inclined; but it would be a whole lot more work than a smarter answer.

As an answer it would quickly get down voted, & commented on itself, hopefully before the OP had chance to take up the idea.  

As a comment, there's no 'defence mechanism' for it.

This is valid for comments as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ah, yes - I always forget comment flags are also categorised


















[I know this isn't an answer, but just to keep it in one thread - not worth a separate question, I didn't think]

Since I hit my 10k rep, this has become a constant source of irritation to my usually well-under-control OCD.

More than half the times I refresh the main questions page, I see a number of flags.
The number of times this matches the number of issues I can actually see in Review is negligible.

It used to match, before I hit 10k. This was literally an overnight change in behaviour.

Figured it out.

First: the certificate for meta.apple.stackexchange.com is definitely invalid. That is, ultimately, at the heart of my problem.

But the problem for me, in Chrome, was caused by my use of the https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=enHTTPS Everywhere Chrome extension. It was responsible for blocking the http calls to meta endpoints that were being made from an https meta page. Once I disable the extension for meta I could vote again.

This all, however, is just pointing a serious flaw in the use of https on the meta sites that needs to be fixed. I'll argue this stands as a bug.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not a bug - we do not (at this time) intend to support https:// on meta sites...nor do we ever link you to them. We would have to change all the meta site URLs for them to do so (or keep track of hundreds of certificates which isn't really tenable).


















I wouldn't delete a post based on a -1 personally. Maybe if you're at -5 and you find the answer is totally not helpful / even when you misunderstand a question and make an attempt to answer, hundreds of people will likely make the same error and having that up can help the site. It also can help someone with a similar problem but they find your answer.

Keep in mind - 4 down votes means that somewhere in the entire internet, 4 accounts at one point in time were cranky and didn't find that post helpful or clear or useful.

I'd focus on making new answers clear, relevant and think if you need to comment for clarification or post an answer that will be of use even if it's not what the OP wants to hear.

Lastly, there is the Stack Exchange Data Explorer where you can craft about any query you can think of to see posts by date, relative date, votes, etc...

This is what I'm seeing on people's profile pages (profile tab):



I can't tell what tab I'm on. Clicking one switched the view, but doesn't highlight the tab. Can we have tab highlighting back?

Nope. It's like a scab, picking at it again starts the oozing and we have to be patient for it to crust over again. I totally get the sentiment that we could have a band-aid to patch it over whilst it heals.

As far as the feature request - how would that work in practice? I'd consider a solution that was less harm than the bump and in this case, the bump got the correct reaction of negative votes to the poster. In effect, the system is working when people get direct feedback not to post dubious answers to old posts.

What the performance impact would be, whether it simplifies or complicates the code base would be up to the developers to decide. I don't see how this would be implemented (as in who would vote to un-bump or if that too would be not the correct action. Basically, I'd want the design to be fleshed out a bit before I'd support it or vote against it.)


















I have been asking a few questions lately about rEFInd and have had to use the tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/refitrefit.

Should we make an updated tag for rEFInd since rEFIt is outdated now? If we shouldn't then why?

This will also help to distinguish between the old rEFIt and the new rEFInd.

Here are the links to the questions:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188190/uninstall-refind-0-8-3-7-on-yosemiteUninstall rEFInd 0.8-3.7 on Yosemite
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188401/install-refind-on-another-partitionInstall rEFInd on another partition

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we make a new tag called 'rEFInd' in replacement of 'rEFIt'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to link to the questions I could see making both temporarily while we sort out what we'll do eventually.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Edited my question to include my links.


















My vote would be to merge both to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/efiefi or some other tag further up the hardware chain.

What are your thoughts of tagging these utilities more on what they do (replace/interface with EFI) than what the program du jour is called?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would say that's a good idea since refit and rEFInd are both to do with the EFI boot-loader. Or could we make a boot-loader tag since it is what boots the computer?


















When I edit a question and change a link from http://www.example.comhttp://www.example.com to [this](http://www.example.com), does it count as 8 characters edited, or as deleting the whole link and retyping (so 30 characters)? When I look at my edit again and see an an edited link I made, all of it is striked through and new text next to it written in green. Does this mean that I edited more characters?

The same with code blocks and blockquotes. How exactly does the character edit counting system work?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How are edited characters counted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whilst we're here, please don't edit http://example.com/ to [this](http://example.com/) as this is worse than leaving the link as it is, as it obfuscates the destination. Either leave the link, formatting it nicely on its own line if it's long, or use appropriate anchor text such as [Example](http://example.com/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Acknowledged. So for example instead of http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2497/how-are-edited-characters-counted?noredirect=1#comment5679_2497 will be [Question on Ask Different Meta](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2497/how-are-edited-characters-counted?noredirect=1#comment5679_2497)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It'd be preferable to use the question's title, however links to other questions on the same site should definitely be left as just a link as the system pulls the question title automatically (except in comments).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do appreciate the edits that you make here; don't worry about a few rejects as long as you understand why the edit was rejected or reject-improved. If you have any questions about a specific edit that was rejected, feel free to ask in chat, and ping me if I was the one to review it as I'd appreciate seeing the discussion.


















I'm of a mind to make it a synonym to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/command-linecommand-line when would anyone have experience in one, they have to have experience in the other. By lumping things together tag clouds and rep and badged make the site better.

Having a tag for any little aspect of command line programming / environment seems counter productive since the search tool can expose path questions extremely well with or without that tag.

Big thanks for the edit to the tag wiki and the attention here.

I've had a look and don't see any indication you should be under any quality throttles on Ask Different. If you're asking on another site, we can migrate this there.

Good news is you're not banned, but there's always a chance the code has some problem to give you that error. 

If not, spend some time reading this link and the notice to be sure you understand the basics covered in those posts.

Nothing on Ask Different is removed and everything is archived. It's a matter of reputation that renders "deleted" questions and posts invisible to users below a certain reputation score.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ah, interesting


















Several sites in the Stack Exchange network have https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/255745/an out-right prohibition of customer support questions.

Ask Different can be quite choosy about ensuring a "CS" question that gets closed is of high quality https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editingby getting edited while it is closed and https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questionsthen reopened for answers.

The why not reasons are typically:

We're not here to act as customer support on any company's behalf.

That's not our mission. We're here to help you learn how to interpret vague or conflicting behaviors once you've exhausted the normal support channels and documented that effort in your question. Your post here will live here for years, so adaquately documenting existing support documents helps your question remain as useful and relevant years from now as well as the day it gets a good answer. 

Furthermore, we don't set policy, we don't have telephone lines, confirmation code generators, internal knowledge base articles and status pages or any authority to make decisions on your behalf. 

We can't track changes to policy except by anecdote and hearsay, so the answers we give you today are likely going to be wrong tomorrow, if not already wrong today. If the company documents service status and policy publicly on the web, then your web search engine of choice is a far better resource than a carefully curated and updated post here can ever be.

Closed customer support questions are often vague.

Good customer support involves some form of 20 questions. Most simple requests need 15 minutes of back and forth to be sure everyone is on the same page. Spreading that discovery process across hours or days with multiple people on the internet is an unsound option at best. If your question shows that you've already put that amount of thought into isolating your problem, it's less likely to be closed. 

But question X is just like mine and it's not closed.

That's the nature of a community moderated resource. Please edit other bad questions and/or vote to close or link duplicate questions. We strive to concentrate knowledge and learning and not host the same tired question 15 times. Even though we often fail to clean things up when a question is initially asked, we hope for the majority of posts, this happens bit by bit for all bad questions.

But https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFJLMyUwrgI REALLY NEED HELP NOW!!! 

That's fine and most of us really do empathize with your plight. Help us help you by getting a friend to copy edit your post and ask you some obvious questions like:


What company supports this product?
Do they have phone support for urgent needs?
Is your frustration or urgency clouding the issue?
Does company X have articles that explain how to troubleshoot this or set it up?
Are there similar questions on this site or the vendor forums that will help narrow the scope of the issue?


Then, you can take concrete steps to improve your question by https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editingediting out any venting/frustration/extraneous data and editing in specific details and research to show what sort of knowledge you need to solve the problem. 

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askhelp guide has great advice on how to post specific, well researched text to allow us to help you solve your urgent dilemma once it is detailed enough to then help many others because it is clear, well researched, and complete.

If either the only way then is contact them e.g. the Apple ID password or else not followed the steps there then close If don;t know where the support is or the steps need explaining then on topic - but we need the pointer hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark Since you have great insight, please consider adding a new answer with your take on what should not be closed as basic CS with examples! Great questions have focus and show research and we love them. Customer support literally embraces one instance of a human having problems getting something done when they can't ask the precise question or look up the document that explains how to X. I think that's the goal here we are striving to set with a bar for not being customer support. It relates to the amount of self-help and usefulness of the potential answers IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this answer specific to companies, or all products. For example, could it be said that **Why we're not customer support for  "open source community project x"**? Does any of this apply if the product or company does not have official support tiers and the like?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EvanCarroll I would say this is general guidance. Why change the quality goals for a question here based on the lack of or presence of support by the creator or other communities? I think our quality standards are about being able to agree what practical question is being asked and then have someone with experience or knowledge answer said post without needing 20 questions of triage.


















I am trying to do some cleaning.

Is there a way to find out in my answers' history (1500), if there is a another answer to the same post that has been accepted?

Nothing more or less.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would say that the accepted check mark is noise in maybe half the questions I see. Even wrong answers are helpful as long as they help others learn. Isn't that the end goal here? Deleting is for things that are actively harmful and that can't be edited into shape - but some cleanup is always welcome if it's not actively harming things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To add to what bmike and patrick already said: acceptance isn't the same as correctness. I've got higher-voted, unaccepted answers on SE sites. I just answered late, with a better answer, and the question asker never came back to correct the vote.


















...or do you have any suggestion, where I could ask such?

I would like to build an iOS application, for which I nead a real OS X-based machine or a service like Macincloud. However, https://stackoverflow.com/a/23682404/1469208this answer suggested, that I can just purchase an OS X and install it on my own PC, either as dual-boot secondary system or as virtual machine.

However, I'm such newbie (ignorant) to OS X and Apple topics, that until reaching out that answer, I even wasn't aware, that it is possible to purchase OS X without purchasing a hardware along with it. And the idea of installing it on PC sounds like a nightmare for me. And that is why I wanted to ask for a possible quick step-by-step guide or a link to an external source, where these matters are covered.

But... I think, that this could be an off-topic question and would like to confirm this before.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about installing OS X on PC on-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2/can-one-ask-hackintosh-questions-on-ask-different?s=1|0.8723  and http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1722/should-the-help-page-remove-the-prohibition-on-hackintosh?s=2|0.7627 for some thoughts on this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the record, it isn't really possible to buy OS X without buying hardware. I mean, theoretically you could buy a DVD of the last version that actually shipped on DVD (that's several versions/years old), then use the App Store to upgrade from there, but then you not only have to get non-Mac hardware to work with the current version, but the several-year-old version as well.


















Running OS X, even virtualized, on non-Apple hardware is a violation of the EULA for the software and, as such, is off topic here on Ask Different.

Your best bet is asking on Stack Overflow since they specialize on tools used primarily by developers. You might link here or ask on meta there to check if they care about bypassing EULA as a general or specific rule.

Second, when asking for off site resources, you would need to pass a high standard of documenting your situation and research and explaining precisely how it doesn't solve your issue.

Lastly, the premise of the OS X on non Mac hardware question begs the question "Why not buy a used Mac?". You could ask what are the minimum hardware requirements to run Xcode version x.y and we would help you identify the pool of used computers to lease or buy to meet your budget needs.

I'm developing my iOS apps in Phonegap, not in native code. And, if my knowledge isn't incorrect, then I need Mac only to submit app (`.ipa` file generated by Phonegap) via [ApplicationLoader](http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi/topics/is_the_last_phonegap_mile_really_forcing_me_to_own_a_mac_and_a_windows_8_computer_and_setup_the#reply_14183859) without even touching the xCode. As per this, I assume, that even cheapest Mac mini will be good.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@trejder Excellent. Getting used equipment is best since it loses so little value over a year that you can usually sell it at marginal loss if you chose wrongly. Speed requirements for developers come from billing constraints so the funding to get proper hardware is a business capital expense. After seeing [WWDC videos of Xcode 7 and Xcode Server continuous integration, etc...](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/), I can't imagine anyone saddling themselves with lesser tools to do iOS development for anything other than self-education or "hobby" uses.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Why not buy a used Mac?" ...or what I ended up doing, buying a bottom-of-the-line Mac Mini.





















Two suggested edits can't be submitted on the same post at the same time. The first suggested edit must be approved or rejected before another suggested edit can be submitted. If the user can approve or reject the suggested edit, either because they have the privilege to do so or the suggested edit was on their own post, they see  and can approve/reject the edit.

You can't submit suggested edits on non-tag-wiki posts on child meta sites. On meta without the edit privilege, you can edit community wiki posts (if you have the necessary privilege), tag wikis (with the suggested edit system in place) and your own posts. Once you have the necessary privilege to edit without suggested edits on the main site, you can edit any post on the child meta.

There are other cases where the edit button would be greyed out and suggested edits not allowed:


Too many of your suggested edits were rejected and you are suspended from suggesting edits for one week.
There are currently 200 suggested edits waiting to be reviewed and therefore no more can be suggested.
The post is locked by a moderator or by 'migration limbo'.
You are suspended.

  Note that once you gain the reputation to vote to close, you should no longer flag for moderator attention to have questions closed or migrated. It is your responsibility to vote now.


and


  It takes 5 close votes to reach the closing threshold (except for duplicate questions, which can be marked as duplicate with a single vote from a user who has earned a gold tag badge in one of that question's original tags).


So even after you've reached the "vote to close" threshold, it still needs five votes to close a question (except if you earned so much reputation from one of tags that the system considers you to be an expert and capable of detecting duplicates on your own :-)).

The main point is that flagging to close doesn't actually flag for a moderator. It simply puts the post into the same review queue as voting to close just without a vote.

It's never acceptable to flag for a moderator to close a question regardless of reputation.

Recently, a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191869/bulk-download-pictures-from-messagesquestion was marked as a duplicate since there was a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88023/how-to-transfer-entire-imessage-conversations-to-computersimilar, but not an actual duplicate, of the question already existing.

In short, the situation was this:


Original question was "How to move an entire iMessage conversation to a computer"
New question was "How to bulk-download photos out of Messages (could be iMessage or SMS) on a phone"


Note that while tangentially connected, and similar, the questions ask two different things. In addition, the answer provided in the original question was not marked as an accepted answer, and also promoted a premium product - not necessarily an available solution to all users. This is not necessarily the first time I have come across a duplicate like this.

Also, the new question does not specifically state that they want the solution to bulk-download items to the computer - it just happens to be one of the provided solutions, but might involve phone, computer, another device, etc.

For full disclosure: I did provide an answer to the newer question. However, I feel that a user might not read the additional content on the new thread (which provides a free, easy answer) instead of the original question (which provides a premium answer to a question they might not find relevant) since it was flagged as a duplicate, making a link to the first question appear at the top. This is not an exploration of how to get my answer accepted and rep boosted, but rather an attempt to provide a quality answer that I think might be lost.

Given the above scenario, my question is this:


Are users besides the OP allowed to challenge question statuses?
What would a user have to do to modify their question enough that it would no longer be marked as duplicate?
Is it possible to have an additional status, something like Similar, which could be used in these situations? (Benefit would be that a user could stumble onto either question, both open, yet have a thread linking them to the other in case one was more relevant to their needs. We all know how changing one or two words in Google can bring significantly different results on most topics)

Editing to clarify things is often all you need to do to make it clear how the "duplicate" is really a follow on or more nuanced take to the linked question. Also - there is no loss of data when a question is closed - just that it needs help to attract new answers. Do you feel the question needs more answers? If so, let's edit it and get it reopened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike definitely agreed on the contextual information. It's fairly broad in terms of what a "duplicate" is. I don't think the question at hand necessarily needs more answers and/or to be reopened, rather it's just useful to know for the future :)


















To illustrate my question or my answer I usually add a screen shot (like the one below) containing parts of the iOS or OS X operating system.


Do I violate Apple's copyrights when doing so?
And if I do violate Apple's copyrights, what is Stack Exchange's policy on this?



b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are iOS and OS X screen shots violating copyrights and therefor allowed on SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am new in meta.apple.stackexchange.com. But this is the place to be for these kind  of questions, right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's the right place to ask, yes. Interesting question, I've never thought of this before.


















Questions that relate to Apple beta software (for example https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192902/restoring-a-backup-to-an-ios-9-devicehttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192902/restoring-a-backup-to-an-ios-9-device) are generally not allowed. 

My understanding is that the NDA now allows more discussion than things it restricts - http://oleb.net/blog/2014/06/apple-lifted-beta-nda/http://oleb.net/blog/2014/06/apple-lifted-beta-nda/

Basically, as long as Apple publicly explains it, discussion is allowed. Screen shots and reverse engineering and discussing things not announced by Apple (whatever a lawyer would assume that means) are still prohibited by the current NDA.

It seems to me that Stack Exchange is the perfect place to discuss working with new Apple tools, and finding work arounds to problems in addition to going elsewhere or to the Apple forums.

Is there some other reason that I'm not aware of that these kind of questions are considered bad form?

NOTE: This relates to https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1712/are-ios-9-and-os-x-el-capitan-questions-okAre iOS 10, macOS 10.12, watchOS 3 or tvOS 10 (beta) questions OK?, but it seemed worth raising as a separate question.

We will lose some people and we won't get all the questions we might if there were no NDA, but there still is NDA covering aspects of beta software that Apple is providing. We should acknowledge that clearly since some questions will inevitably breach someone's NDA.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another problem is that questions about Beta software are only valid for tiny windows of time, and are, by their very nature riddled with bugs. It can be just a matter of weeks before a new beta is released, with lots of bug fixes, potentially negating the questions and answers forever.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike you did mean to tag it as \[faq\], not [faqs] :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nicael Thank you! Darn auto correct or darn mod powers to make crazy tag names. I've hopefully cleaned up that confusing plural tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to add the "voting" answers of yes - temporarily and no - stay the course so that we can see if there is consensus either way.


















NDA is just one of several reasons why questions about non-public beta software don't work well on Ask Different, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1331/can-i-ask-about-not-yet-publicly-released-osCan I ask about not-yet-publicly released OS? lists the others. So even with the NDA partially lifted, I still think that questions about iOS 9/OS X El Capitan need to wait until at least public betas are available.

Also, we are not here to enforce agreements, but Apple is very clear that betas and pre-release software are confidential. 


https://beta.apple.com/sp/en/betaprogram/faqhttps://beta.apple.com/sp/en/betaprogram/faq



  Yes, the public beta software is Apple confidential information. Don’t install the public beta software on any systems you don't directly control or that you share with others. Don’t blog, post screen shots, tweet, or publicly post information about the public beta software, and don't discuss the public beta software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in the Apple Beta Software Program. If Apple has publicly disclosed technical information about the public beta software, it is no longer considered confidential.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is clearly the established answer. I'm actually going to advocate for removing this restriction in an answer. I've been agitating to get someone to ask this question and now that it's up, we can see if it's still a good policy or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this still a yes - once public beta starts or no - we shouldn't do it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As far as I can see, both answers here agree on the "public beta" part, so yes :-)


















I declined the flag earlier today, specifically because wrong answers are not a reason for flagging (simply downvote on such cases) and in general because on a user-moderated site like Ask Different (and all the other Stack Exchange sites) quality issues can usually be resolved by higher-rep users directly (in this case probably by removing the conspiracy theory at the end).

Take a look at the answer, there's no real content there. Line 1 has "Opaque secret encoded ... Suspect". Line 2 is a copy from the question. Line 3 is not answering the question. Line 4 is ranting. If you clean that up, there's nothing left... That's why I flagged it as "very low quality", it can't be salvaged.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I meant is: It's not a wrong answer - it's not an answer at all...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I upvoted both this answer and your comment @nwinkler. This is a pretty interesting edge case. I've edited out the last paragraph of the answer, which makes no attempt to answer the question. The rest could be argued to be an *attempt* to answer the question, which is all that matters.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm with patrix - flags are for things that moderators NEED to fix now and can't wait for the normal tools to work. In this case, the criticism is against a state or a government and not a person. Criticism is not only allowed, but it's encouraged. Editing to change the reason of a post is poor form. Much better to constructively criticize the criticism in a polite comment and then down vote the post. In cases where impolite words are used - they can be softened with editing per the site's guidelines. Just a few more down votes will make that post almost invisible to everyone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have a slightly different perspective than patrix and @bmike; I'm sympathetic to their view and fully respect it, but I view things a bit differently.  I see flags as serving multiple purposes: one purpose is to notify ♦-moderators of problems that need to be fixed and can only be fixed by ♦-moderators, but a second purpose of some kinds of flags is to notify 10K users of problems that they can fix without the assistance of ♦-moderators.  I elaborate in [my answer](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2552/24154).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's not an answer.  It's up to you to offer a more enlightened answer.  That's what this forum is for.  Are you saying that no nefarious forces have made it into the operating system ?   We now know conspiracy theory is a lot closer to fact than fiction.  Today 2015.


















In a nutshell - here are some statements that I hope are fact based and hard to dispute for anyone:


We don't police agreements/NDA - we do strive to produce great answers to specific questions. The "NDA situation" is complicated (and there are 4 different versions of the NDA that I've seen or believe to exist). We will lose some people and we won't get all the questions we might if there were no NDA, but there still are formal NDAs covering the beta software that Apple is providing. We should acknowledge that clearly since some questions will inevitably breach someone's NDA.
The history of Ask Different comes from the Trilogy (https://stackoverflow.comSO/https://superuser.comSU/https://serverfault.comSF) and inherited specific close reasons designed for those sites and those times - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4818/what-questions-should-be-closed-with-reason-too-localizedclosing questions solely because they are too narrow is https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasonsno longer appropriate here (or there)
Apple is certainly changing quite rapidly in therms of enrolling thousands and millions of people in their beta programs - this mitigates the main complaint I see against beta questions which is not having enough expertise to get useful or constructive answers. Yes, some people are signing NDA - but all of those NDA are time limited and covering less and less of the product as Apple publicly hours and hours of detailed video as well as https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/6876#16139publicly opened their extensive developer discussions to the public at large.
Apple forums don't exist for all beta users (just for invited seed participants and paid developers), and we don't close shop on Q/A just because https://discussions.apple.com/welcomeApple Discussions also exists for user questions and answers. 
Apple Developer forums are now publicly readable just like the WWDC videos and developer documentation, so in effect, anything posted on these sites is "published" directly by Apple and that could weaken NDA claims on content hosted there in the open.


Specifically, Ask Different's active users have had two years of experience with letting extremely narrow, unlikely to be widely applicable questions be asked and I feel the site is better for them. 



Now for my opinions about the above facts in relation to how I see the site growing and adapting to Apple and to the users of this site's needs today and going forward.

I don't see any harm if people ask a question like In beta build 15A204h of 10.11 I can't log into FaceTime and don't know which error log to look or Is there a way to figure out why this specific app won't run under gatekeeper on beta build 15A204h?

I would like to be able to keep questions like the following open as Apple has thoroughly documented how the beta software works and/or intends to work which makes it concrete, shipping (for some) and answerable without regard to violating an NDA should one even exist between Apple and the OP/Answerers.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193368/What is the "rootless" feature in El Capitan, really?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191421/Can I make my own kernel extensions on El Capitan?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/190855/OS X El Capitan find mouse dosen't work with external mouse
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/190826/How do I use Split View in OS X 10.11 El Capitan?


All of the above are answerable, clear, useful IMO.

We have all the close reasons to handle vague questions, too broad questions, and basic customer support questions for beta builds as well as we do for normal builds. Adding beta to a bad question still means we will close it with prejudice. However, I believe the quality of questions on the site will rise if we make this change since we are selecting for the most active users of Apple products. I welcome people asking about OS 9 and older technology and want to also welcome people that have legitimate questions about using any Apple product or service. Full stop.

There clearly will be people uncomfortable with potentially violating their NDA and we will probably lose their input, but Apple is clearly putting their beta software in very wide audience. To wit, https://www.apple.com/iwork-for-icloud/Apple's iWork for iCloud is in beta and has been so since June 2013. We should allow questions on software that people use, and people are using Apple's beta software widely. No NDA or paid developer account is needed to download Xcode 7, iWork in iCloud, or view any of the WWDC videos from this year. Yes, some people will participate in the https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/welcomeiOS and OS X AppleSeed customer seeding or the https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcomeApple Beta Software Program beta seeding program or the https://developer.apple.com/programs/Apple Developer Program and be encumbered with those agreements between them and Apple.


  Is the public beta software confidential? Yes, the public beta software is Apple confidential information. Don’t install the public
  beta software on any systems you don't directly control or that you
  share with others. Don’t blog, post screen shots, tweet, or publicly
  post information about the public beta software, and don't discuss the
  public beta software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in
  the Apple Beta Software Program. If Apple has publicly disclosed
  technical information about the public beta software, it is no longer
  considered confidential.


So, participants should be totally in the clear if they are only discussing what Apple has publicly disclosed. Yes, people may find it harder to keep track of what is confidential and not - so each person will have to make a choice if they can keep track of things or just want to walk out of the room if they are uncomfortable with the topics being discussed like any adult should always feel empowered to do.

Also, since we have tags and search terms to help us find beta software and flags for people to alert moderators - we can use the typical post notices to ask people to document their words with a public link or face removal.

Also, I'm still going to be voting to close questions about "future" betas, or "future OS" as described well in these two answers


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1115/Questions about OS X before it is released to the general public?
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1332/Can I ask about not-yet-publicly released OS?


Note that the problems with speculative questions (Will the final version do X, When will Apple do Y, Will this bug get fixed) are not unique to betas therefore allowing good beta questions will not allow bad questions (beta or not) in on this specific coat tail.

I look forward to hearing from any community organizers, interested parties, or past/present moderators if they see any issues with my listing of "facts" as well as my opinions expressed here in favor of "lifting the ban" on beta posts pretty much immediately. I would expect us to all monitor things until later this fall fall to see whether we were too hasty or if this change fits in with both Apple in 2015 and our community of users in 2015.

Don't see the benefit of having Q&As on OS versions which only a few have access to (and which age quickly)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What if the same build is seeded in both channels?

My point is it's not just a few people with access now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it is seeded through the public channel, it's fine. I just think that for issues with non-public betas, discussions on one place (the Apple forums) might be better because the involved people are fewer and it doesn't help if they are split across several places. Also Apple will most likely not read AD.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Three thoughts. Apple has support forums for shipping software and we don't roll up our carpet. (We are better moderated, clearer and more searchable). Apple does read online forums per Phil Schiller. Beta users don't get a feedback channel. Other users of beta software should still use official feedback channels just like users of "release" software do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1. The test should always be this: Why do we NEED to close this question type for the long term goals of serving the most people?  To my view, public beta questions are a no-brainer.  (I'd be open to some private, too, but see both sides there.)   I know it's not apple, but Gmail was in public beta for *five years*.   Also, I have one RIGHT NOW and need help. :)

It's a perfectly fine question in my opinion. It's definitely on-topic and you've covered all the points necessary for a question, even including screenshots to help understand what you're explaining.

The only reason I can think for an explanation for the downvote is that some users regard questions asking why Apple has done what they have done can only be answered by Apple themselves, and therefore is not appropriate for a site for Apple users.

That's of course presuming that the downvote was of 'good intention'. Other causes vary in possibility, from a downvote in 'spite' from the user who's answer you stated didn't answer the question, to someone mis-clicking. Not to mention the random http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/22549890#22549890downvote sprees.

Don't worry about a single random downvote—the net score is still positive.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks. I didn't really mean it to be a "why" - I couldn't see the pattern in the behaviour or predict what would happen next, and it turns out there was an answer to that, yay - but I can see how it might have come across as a "Whyyyyy?" at first glance. It's net positive now, but when I posted this meta question it was at -1, which is always discouraging :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@CupawnTae Indeed, I hoped that my first paragraph answered the question, but I felt that just two lines of an answer was a bit curt. I upvoted the question FWIW.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interestingly, two of my three other questions on this site have now been downvoted in quick succession, months after I asked them with very little activity since... This is starting to feel personal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1, but the "user whose answer he stated didn't answer the question" had (and still has) only 101 rep, not enough to have done the downvote. So that particular suggestion isn't possible.


















TL:DR - this is actually Not an Answer…

I only learned today from the other answers & comments how part of the review queue system works, so this is based on that revelation.

I often find the NAA flag 'difficult'. I see a new post, it's clearly not an answer, but it's not in the VLQ queue, so there's no vote to close option.

So, I stick a canned response on it & hit NAA… which means a mod has to deal with it.  

Kind of unfair on the mods, really. Even a truly obvious one takes some time & attention to process.

Based on other answers, it would seem that flagging it as VLQ would allow the 10k users to handle it & leave the mods to deal with more serious issues.

So - & this is the part where it really becomes a new question, but it does feel relevant as part of this thread - would it be better policy for Reviewers to aim more frequently at VLQ than NAA, freeing up Mods' time to do other things?

Case in point - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193816/why-is-an-album-in-apple-music-marked-with-an-e-and-grayed-out/194519#194519Why is an album in Apple Music marked with an "E" and grayed out? which I flagged as NAA.
What's the consensus on flagging these as VLQ & letting the 10k deal with them instead?

My question to improve: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/194934/how-to-check-if-the-screen-replacement-part-for-iphone-5s-is-an-original-oneHow to check if the screen replacement part for iPhone 5s is an original one?



Some clarifications on questions from bmike:


  Are you looking for knowledge? If so, remove price


What's wrong with the price? It gives background for my question: official services can only help with providing a complete replacement for x3-x4 of display replacement by an unofficial repair service. That's why I can only consider unofficial repair shops.


  remove the part about how you want to be sure that one specific repair shop uses parts that you feel are "genuine".


Again, it's only here for providing a context. I don't mind removing it entirely, but why it improves the question?


  It seems you need to: a) write a written contract requiring the vendor to use "official" parts b) demand documentation of that before paying


We need to assume that contract just won't solve my problem, for whatever reasons. How can we limit the scope of question to "how can I check whether the display is genuine", no matter how I get that display into my iPhone?


  What does https://locate.apple.comhttps://locate.apple.com list for options?


It lists only authorized services which don't help, as I specified in the very beginning of the post: they can only replace the entire device. 


  How much is a repair part? You can get quotes for parts to be mailed to you for Apple parts. If you did that work, please document it in the question as it removes the "opinion" of too costly


I don't understand this piece. First, I'm not buying a part, I need a repair to be done--which includes that the repair shop provides the display part. Then, Apple doesn't sell its genuine parts to end-users, nor officialy does any third party AFAIK.


  Off site resources is "locating repair parts".


I'm not about to buy a replacement part, see above.


  justify what you feel is "genuine" in the post.
  I already detailed that: "made by Apple (no matter new or extracted from a used phone) rather than a third-party replica" (removed "as" which could be a reason for confusion)
  
  Show your research. Can you buy parts from Apple Authorized Service providers?


What should I do to satisfy this?


  Are you willing / able to open and measure the device?
  State that explicitly in the question.


Should I state every possible check as "allowed"? If not, why specifically "open and measure"?


  you say "as official ones don't provide screen replacement in my region"
  document that


What should I do to satisfy this?


  When you go to locate.apple.com - list the cost and options you are presented.


There's no cost and options, only a list of authorized services. Each of those tells the same story: "only replacement of entire device". Are you asking for proof-links to non-English web sites for that? (as I live in Russia)


  You instead voice an opinion "don't provide" - my guess is they do provide parts and there is a specific cost for them


See above.


  What does the last sentence and the two youtube videos mean?
  And does criteria for iPhone 5 fully apply to 5S (eg. 1, 2)?
  That's far too broad IMO.


I provide two examples (youtube links) of genuiness check for iPhone 5. If (for example) 5 and 5S have completely identical genuine parts, tips for 5 work for 5S. If not, they don't--that easy.

I am absolutely welcoming handing the issue to another moderator, as [I did one month ago](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2559/how-can-i-make-my-question-comply-to-all-ask-different-guidelines?noredirect=1#comment5790_2559)--but no one appeared since.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike The overall process so far doesn't look extremely cooperative or constructive from my POV--especially that ["I solved my problem long ago, and now only trying to leave as much reusable information as possible"](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/194934/how-to-check-if-the-screen-replacement-part-for-iphone-5s-is-an-original-one#comment237399_194934) -- and that an [absolutely similar question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/196453/tell-if-screen-is-original-or-replacement-on-iphone-5) on iPhone 5 is alive and well, without any scrutiny at all.


















It looks good to me now. It is asking how you can check that a replicament part is genuine.

I can see not way in that this is for Customer support. Actually having seen a few closed under that I wonder if the wording of the close reason is wrong. Asking for off site resources should be off topic - why is Customer support even asked for?

This isn't about apple services - it's about a single user, iPhone 5s and iPhone 5 and a single repair shop IMO. It's basically like - how can I tell if these beats are genuine or knock-off. It's shopping and vague and will solicit opinions instead of facts. I agree the close reason is a catch-all for crappy questions. We might need to rework the close reasons looking at the close data we've recently been granted by the site tools.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike the OP is asking how he can check - your response is he can't - but that does not make the question incorrect


















The reopening process is covered in detail at: 


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/reopen-questionshttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/reopen-questions


You will need to edit the question for me to cast a reopen vote.

My suggestion is to think about these issues:


Are you looking for knowledge? If so, remove price and the part about how you want to be sure that one specific repair shop uses parts that you feel are "genuine".
Are you asking to learn how Apple sources repair parts?


As it stands, it's about you interacting with an un-named repair shop that isn't authorized by Apple.  

It seems you need to:

a) write a written contract requiring the vendor to use "official" parts
b) demand documentation of that before paying

It's not clear if you've done any research. What does https://locate.apple.comhttps://locate.apple.com list for options? How much is a repair part? You can get quotes for parts to be mailed to you for Apple parts. If you did that work, please document it in the question as it removes the "opinion" of too costly. Facts can't be mis-interpreted but without documenting what you are really trying to do - this question, in my opinion will get all sorts of bad answers. The answerer can't guess from all the options you might need help. Lastly, you have an answer, so the need to open it for more answers is less dire IMO. Anyone that knows more than the answerer can edit to improve the post.

As it stands, the question has several issues:


Too broad - iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s are lumped together.
Too vague - you don't show your research and instead ask for opinion. (linking to two youtube videos isn't the sort of research that works here - you should summarize the key facts you wish to discuss from a video and keep the link for background).


TL;DR - put some effort into editing it or at least cut it down to one specific model. 5s or 5

You redirected from original question to meta, but also ask some of clarifyng questions in the chat. I'm not sure how or whether it's be a good thing to incorporate all the clarifications in the original question at AskDifferent, but of course I can clarify whatever you ask. As a separate answer here at Meta? As an update to my Meta post? Both sound counter-intuintive for me, but I can live with it. Comments were ruled out earlier.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Went ahead and added clarifications to question here on Meta--although, again, it's very counter-intuintive.

This is not an encouragement to have Apple Developer Forums misused for discussions that are not developer-oriented. Neither is this an attempt to alter opinions on what's acceptable within Stack Exchange.

I know, I know... This probably looks like another idiot complaining that the beta of all things is buggy. I know right? ZOMG WHATS THE POINT OF A BUGGY BETA??!?!? 

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

But, I think this is a worthy question. And besides, I am pretty convinced it's not a bug. No, I am positive. I use an iPod Touch fifth generation, and am painfully aware of how ancient the processor is. I downloaded the iOS 9 public beta the other day, because after all, I had nothing to lose if the iPod 6 is coming tomorrow And it has gone surprisingly well! But I noticed that some of the features they advertise for iOS 9 are not there. Like the Smart Search thingy when you swipe right on the first page of the home screen. And also, I don't know if this is supposed to be a iPhone 6 only feature, but I am missing the Low Power Mode switch in settings. 

I don't know if these features are supposed to be released later in a future beta release, if it's a problem with my A5 processor, or if I missed the memo on some information that would be fun to have at the moment. But I've held of from providing Apple with feedback yet, because I am pretty sure it's my fault somewhere or another... Anyway, if you are having a similar experience or have some blindingly obvious information that I overlooked, let me know. Thanks!



Ok, hold the iPhone!

Now, I understand why(maybe) my question has received down votes. Because I am discussing software that "hasn't been released to the public". However, I disagree. It is, in fact, and say it with me: a public beta. The key word there is public. In case you didn't notice the italic font I used there. Now,  technically, and this article proves it: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1712/are-ios-9-and-os-x-el-capitan-questions-ok?cb=1Are iOS 10, macOS 10.12, watchOS 3 or tvOS 10 (beta) questions OK?

Look at the excepted answer. What happens next will shock and amaze you. 


  We do have precedent for allowing questions on software that is released in a beta status so if/when these OS versions get a wider release (perhaps as part of the OS X Beta seed program), we may have to revisit whether to
  have the policy relaxed with respect to software that is pre-release.


That when, Ladies and gentlemen, is NOW. Like it or not.

A couple of things 


welcome to Ask Different.
Generally, discussion is OK on meta only - so if you post questions on the main site, don't ask for opinions or experience - narrow down the issue and just assume people with opinions or experience will answer.
The community will need to have significantly more votes for the "yes" answer than the "no" answer in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2537/Should beta OS questions be on-topic due to NDA changes + widening distribution by Apple
Unless there is a groundswell of yes sentiment, then the status quo of "close them as they are off-topic" will continue (see https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1712/are-ios-9-and-os-x-el-capitan-questions-okAre iOS 10, macOS 10.12, watchOS 3 or tvOS 10 (beta) questions OK?)


I personally answered the "yes" and "no" responses, so voting on them is out of my hands. Should I be a tie breaker, I'm likely to fall on "yes - let's try opening beta software for a trial" but ideally, the community will vote overwhelmingly for one answer to not need one moderator's tie breaker at all.

Yes - Only if it's a public beta version

We should allow OS X and iOS public beta questions only. This is because ANYONE can install public beta OSes but only developers can install the developer preview.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is an addition to +bmike's answers. This allows people to say yes to public beta versions only instead of the developer builds as well. This lets more people to answer questurns since anyone can install the public betas. This also lets Apple iron out any issues that may be in the developer build for the public.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So - you are "yes: public beta", "no: apple seeding" and "no:developer" ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. I think it should be public beta only because then any iOS user can find the answers useful, otherwise for a lot of users the questions will be 'junk' if you know what I mean.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike As long as any user can have access to the iOS/OS X, we should allow it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfectly unclear to me. So any user can have access to OS X if they pay for a Mac and accept the EULA. Any user can have access to beta builds if they pay for a developer account and accept the EULA. Any user can participate in the open beta program if they agree to the EULA. I don't get how "any user" and "can have" work out in practice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I think it should be public beta only because this means that Apple allows anyone to install the pb iOS/OSX onto their computer without paying, meaning it is available to everyone (because some people like me don't want to pay the $99 to test iOS and OS X).

I'm on the Appleseed Beta program, and my Beta software seems to differ from genuine paid developer program software.  So there can easily be questions relating to things like "Where's the new iCloud Drive app in the Beta?" by people like me who don't have it, with people answering "Er, on your home screen" by people who do etc.  There's precious little parity for many things, so even is we started using a Beta specific tag that we would then use to locate and destroy upon release, it could still cause some wild confusion and speculation.  So I say NO, let's just not cover it.  The Dev program has a free tier with their own discussion boards, and that is the appropriate place.

However, there are time when you can reference a beta, without having is as the primary point of the question.  As an example, a while ago someone asked how to get a WIFI password that had been forgotten from an iPhone.  At the time, the answer was "You can't", but a valid answer was also "You will be able to after the next release of iOS when Keychain will sync to a Mac if you have one and allow you to read it from there".

I asked this question recently:

My question has nothing to do with Apple Music.  Apple Music is a streaming service, where the Music App is what comes pre-installed on Apple Devices.  I was having a playlist issue and that is specific to the Music App.

I don't have enough rep to reject the edit, but I also don't want to just edit again and change the tag, which will prompt the original editors to just retag, etc. etc…

I fielded a question this evening regarding an issue with Apple's Handoff functionality, which was introduced in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite. The tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/handoffhandoff is only shown as a synonym of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/continuitycontinuity.

While 'Continuity' describes what Handoff does, it introduces a tag which does not represent the official term for the feature as named by Apple.

As I have insufficient reputation to raise a tag edit, I am posing it here. The main tag for the functionality should be renamed https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/handoffhandoff with the synonym referenced as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/continuitycontinuity. This change will reflect Apple's branding of the feature.

Continuity is no where to be found. Ask Different is a forum where most of the questions will come from users not developers, and they are not going to be looking for Continuity. If nothing else, then each of those features should have a tag that matches what they are called under iOS settings, so that users can be directed to questions that cover what they need to be working with.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you look at the [press release for Yosemite](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/06/02Apple-Announces-OS-X-Yosemite.html) they are referred to as continuity features, however in the first paragraph you will see that continuity is in lower case and is thus not an Apple feature in and of itself. This is highlighted in paragraph 8 where words like Handoff, Message, Hotspot are capitalized within the sentence, showing that they are proper nouns and not adjectives.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe that Continuity is the name referred to the set of features which include Handoff. As you can see in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681 , it is referred to as Continuity with a capital C.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The support page is less likely to have Apple Legal scrutinize it the same way as a press release would be scrutinized, as there are implications to securities laws that an official document such as a press release could run afoul of if misworded. The function, both on the page that you linked to and in the iOS system preferences is Handoff. The only place you find continuity mentioned is on the website. Try this if you have Yosemite. Go to Finder>Help>Mac Help and in the search window type in Handoff and Contituity. Which is an accepted search term that returns help pages on the function?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AMR I searched and found an article on [Continuity](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/work-across-devices-with-continuity-mchl1d734309/10.13/mac/10.13.1) and another on [Handoff](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/pick-up-where-you-left-off-with-handoff-mchl732d3c0a/10.13/mac/10.13.1). The Handoff article mentions the need to meet "[Continuity](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/aside/glose229df1e/10.13) requirements" (including the link).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AMR The Continuity article has a section named Handoff which says: "Handoff lets you start a document, email, or message on one device and pick up where you left off on another device. Handoff works with apps like Mail, Safari, Maps, Messages, Reminders, Calendar, Contacts, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. For more information, see [Pick up where you left off with Handoff](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/pick-up-where-you-left-off-with-handoff-mchl732d3c0a/10.13)." Auto Unlock, Universal Clipboard, Instant Hotspot, Phone Calls/SMS Messages (on Mac), and AirDrop aren't Handoff.


















Just wondering if you can have an answer removed here without any indication that it has been removed? No admin comments, no downvotes, nothing. Just an answer disappear?

I answered a couple of my own questions and saw that one got downvoted, so I'm assuming this is a community no-no simply answering your own question?

Another I answered (submitted some time ago), with what I thought to be a concise, useful answer that did not exist anywhere on the site, and it is just gone, with nothing indicating why.

I'm not one to care much about Karma or reputation. I'm more concerned about getting banned or not being able to post for a while.

Thanks,

Chris

Answer away! Even your own questions! There's even a facility to post an answer to a question at the _same time_ you post the question! :D


















Posts, both questions and answers, can be deleted by elected moderators (denoted by the diamond) and those who have the necessary reputation to cast delete votes on posts.

However, these posts aren't actually deleted. The original poster of the question or answer can always view their own deleted posts, even if the post was deleted by a moderator rather than themselves. Furthermore, deleted questions and answers are visible to those who have sufficient reputation and a link to the post.

The posts are hidden from the user profile (except to elected moderators) but you can see your own recently deleted posts by clicking the button at the bottom of the questions/answers tab on your profile activity.

It is possible to go one step further and genuinely remove it, this usually requires "destroying" the user and all their content, usually when dealing with SPAM accounts etc.


















I was wondering if humorous questions are possible. Is it forbidden by site policy or anything else?



I would also like to know if the least bit if sense of humor would be good to header the question.

Here's an example:

Original

MacBook Air 2012 USB Port change or repair


Humorous

MacBook Air 2012 USB Port make happy and delighted




Please, note that I did everything I could to make this question as neutral as it was possible.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it possible to be asking humorous questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Be aware that in the example you gave particularly, a lot of the question content was sacrificed to humor.  Humor is great, but the main focus of the site takes precedence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For instance, this question itself is poorly worded. Reading the title, I thought you were about to create _purely_ humorous questions, while reading your actual examples, it's clear you mean to ask _actual_ questions, using an humorous language. Obviously they are two completely different things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lohoris, these are just different degrees of one things. My example is an instance of the light version of humorous question with a neutral pun.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have seen humorous titles before - it's okay as long as it's a small pun. The example of my favorite title was in a different community (Unix & Linux), but demonstrates the quality of having humor in a title. The person asking wanted to terminate the `cat` command before it finished because he frequently used it on on long files on accident. He titled the question _"How to kill a runaway cat?"_ . (http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/176917/how-to-kill-a-runaway-cat)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"... make happy and delighted" sounds like it was literally translated from another language in a wrong way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@adib, it's not.


















If you are here to joke, that won't go over well.

However if you have a real problem to solve, please enjoy puns every once in a while if you wish. Language can have wonderful shades of meaning and expression, but the site also requires you to be open to:

a) someone perhaps editing it (and we can help resolve things if there's an honest disagreement on what belongs and what doesn't)

b) making sure the intent and details are still clear

I think you have no worries on either case based on the example you provided. Feel free to ask your question on the main site and link here / comment if anything comes up or someone doesn't get the humor. Also, don't be too attached to the humor part in case it gets edited out to make the question more useful or clear if needed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That makes me feel more free. What about intended humorous questions like `How do I install Windows updates through MacPorts?`, which are not about anything serious but are just a piece of fun in the Sunday afternoon? I don't mean humiliating or something like that, just a question that itself is a little joke?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The overall rule of having questions relate to solveable real-world problems still applies. So asking how to apply Windows upgrades through MacPorts or how to interface your Mac with a Flux Converter probably won't get you very far.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also - I should have mentioned, when you are the butt of the joke, it's often the best. Making someone else the butt of a joke requires more social trust than an open internet forum can usually apply. Humor doesn't often translate well across social groups and can actively make the site hard to use for people that don't speak english natively or are in on your argot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, I thought I'd be notified in case someone replies. Thanks for the answer, it fully covered all questions I had in mind!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@theoden I messed up - you won't get notified unless I mention you as I did in this comment and neglected to do in the other comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Installing Windows updates through MacPorts can be useful for updating some Wine/CrossOver installations (e.g. `.NET` runtime, ODBC drivers, and the like).


















I have posted a short blog entry about a change to the site scope to announce the allowing of beta questions.


http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/


In the past, it would show up promptly in the sidebar / community bulletin area. So far, it's a no show. 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/BxcKj.png

Do I need to do something specific to allow that or has that been changed intentionally over time?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I get a blog post to show up in the site sidebar?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose I could abuse the "community event" tool to do this, but would rather wait if it's something the code can handle natively once it's hooked up again. (??)


















The code that processes site links is skipping the ask different blog to grab a title in a similar manner to how site questions get rendered from the raw links
See:

It would be nice if the blog posts were prettied up auto magically.

I don't know whether it is the start of the school year, but I feel like I am seeing more and more questions that could very easily be answered by the OP with a simple Google search. 

An example was an OP that experienced "Error Code -36" when attempting to move a directory from one drive to another. 

I did the Google search error code 36 finder and the first article returned had a solution for the problem from OS X Daily.

In a way I almost feel like we are doing a disservice to the OPs with providing them an answer that is more detailed than:

The answer to this can be found by performing the Google search ______

While this may be a bit snarky, it also may get them in the habit of going to Google and typing in what we have written, sort of in the spirit of Zed Shaw's "Learn The Hard Way" series. I don't even think that we should provide a hyperlink. If this gets them into the mindset of "I'll do a few Google searches on my own before I ask," it may help them not only by making them more autonomous users but may also help to improve the quality of the questions that are actually asked and reduce the moderation effort to keep the site properly curated.

I am less inclined to ignore the questions as there are people who genuinely don't know what is going on or that their problem isn't unique and there are resources that can be found with one or two well thought out search terms. It is also easy to panic when you encounter an error and that tends to reduce some people's ability to problem solve. The problem becomes that it is difficult to determine those from the people who just rush here to ask everything while putting no thought into it.

I would be interested in hearing what other's thoughts are, as it starts becoming discouraging rather quickly when you try to provide helpful answers, but realize the same answer could have just as easily been found by the OP with a simple search engine query in far less time.

And if I need to make a proposal, it would be that when a question is posed that only requires a simple search that we resolve to answer, in the comments, with something similar to  what I highlighted above.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Discussion Topic: Increase In Questions That Are Simply Solved With Google Searchb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ultimately most knowledge is just one, correct Google search away. But that doesn't mean the Stack Overflow model is obsolete. Curating good quality questions and answers is important because...surprise!...they _improve_ Google search results! If you ever find yourself contemplating a "Just Google it Answer" my suggestion is to take a break from Ask Different. Perspective is everything.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am not saying that the model is obsolete, I am saying that there are certain questions that warrant a thoughtful, detailed, well researched, and referenced answer which will serve as a helpful reference for others and some that are questions that no real thought went into. It is like when I was in elementary and high school and I would ask my parents how to spell a word or what the definition was, and they would respond "You have a dictionary, look it up."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you think answering a question is beneath you: move on. Some low-hanging fruit for newer users is nice to have. We are not your parents and no one here should be saying "just look it up".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. Look at my answer and comment record on my profile before you make an accusation like that. You will see that those are the majority of the question I am trying to help with... I have plenty of zero vote answers because I answered first timers that no one else is providing answers to. Not because the answers aren't thorough and good, but because first timers usually never follow up or take an active role in the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm merely commenting on your stated belief that certain questions don't "warrant a thoughtful, detailed, well researched, and referenced answer" -- if you happen upon a question like that, you don't need to answer it. Certainly no answer is better than "just google it". If it's unanswerable in the form it's in, some edits are worthwhile and if it cannot be rescued, flag it for closing.


















I'm a strong believer in asking simple questions simply. Even if your question can be found by a google search, I feel it's totally on topic here.

The links above are gold-standard simple questions. Short, clear and they really don't need a whole litany of What version?, What did you try? to be effective. Heck - even grammar doesn't really matter. Mac vs mac in the title - who cares, let's get on with the learning :-)

If the person asking (the OP) can't make a clear case for the issue or they can't distinguish between asking for help troubleshooting vs asking others to do all the work to solve the OP's vaguely composed problem - there's the line I use to identify a question that needs to be put on hold to meet the documented quality standards we expect.

The immense value I see in Stack Exchange is three fold with respect to simple questions:


Searchability - google indexes us and we have an excellent tag system to get the correct keywords exposed to people, internal search and external search.
Reputation - people can quickly see a number and know if the poster has been given/earned rep or not
Curation - the SE tools for editing, voting, cleaning up, deleting bad posts is second to none in my opinion.


The curation aspect is why I volunteer so much time here.

Apple Discussions, vendor forums, about.com and others when faced with a  "simple google it question" are, pardon my bluntness, a total shit show.

I'm not saying everything they do is crappy, but that in the case where you mention "a simple search" + "adequate knowledge" = easy answer, they really fall short and don't measure up to my expectations.

People can be angry, irritated, lazy, unfocused, and downright mean. I know of no other on-line system that is capable of meaningfully removing that noise and let the signal of a great question and more importantly a great answer rise above the muck.

So - even though I quite often personally don't choose to answer simple "just google it" questions, that doesn't mean I don't encourage and approve of them. Heck, sometimes I even down vote them with what I hope is received as constructive criticism in the comments pointing out how I'd like to see the question improved if I feel there is value in getting a clearer question. Other times, I'll use a soft question as a place to put a heavily researched, hopefully useful summation of knowledge based on years of experience in hopes that it reaches hundreds of people as well as helping the person that came here to ask instead of just googling it.

As long as a question has enough context to let someone take a good stab at helping, I feel it belongs here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you about Apple Discussions, even though I will look there on occasion. I usually skip Apple Discussions though and look at the Mac World, OS X Daily, How to Geek, Mac Life, etc. entries returned. Then again finding the answers on my own I guess comes naturally to me. I forget that almost 35 years of experience with computers means that for much of that time, it was DIY with few resources or experts to turn to. Being relatively new to Macs, I have had to do the searches more often recently, but I guess the experience I bring makes me better at evaluating the usable answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AMR Well said. What I love here is that people can focus on answering the questions _they_ personally feel are helpful. Not everyone can or wants to be a [Graham Perrin](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/126588/5472) and do superb research on asking. http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/176815/5472


















I'm not expecting much in the way of upvotes for this simple, all-encompassing statement,
but here goes...

Some people's Google-Fu just isn't that good, & nothing we do or say will ever improve that.

So we do the Googling for them & by honing sharp, crisp, accurate answers to their vague questions can actually improve the chances that others with only a white belt in Google-Fu can find that answer for themselves; because Stack Exchange answers are frequently near the top of some quite vague Google searches.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I prefer Google Ninja.


















If someone asked a question that was grammatically incorrect or had poor formatting, and someone edited the question to improve it, what would the editor do if the OP would keep re-editing or rolling-back to the first version?

Would the question get deleted, or is there any function to prevent the OP from editing his question? If I had 2k reputation and this would happen, what should I do in that case? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What would happen if a high-rep user or moderator edited a question, and the OP rolled back constantly?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, most high rep users just walk away from a post where the OP wants to have dictatorial control over the wording. Kind of a "suit yourself" if it's really something that can't be agreed upon. When an OP really doesn't want help - sometimes that's just fine to let them be. Editing posts that should belong to the community is pretty much the only time the OP loses control of the say - and the post can be dissociated from the account if they don't rage quit rather than try to work it out.


















Edit wars can lead to moderators locking posts from further edits. We'll usually ask warring factions to take it to a chat room to work out their differences and if that can't be facilitated, moderators will keep the lock in place and make a call on what the persistent form of the question or answer should look like.

I should add: edit wars that can't be resolved amicably are exceedingly rare on Ask Different.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would also add, that we moderators check in with each other when we are the subject of flags or discussion about edits. So in general, we recuse ourselves if that helps everyone come to an agreement on a specific post or action. I'd say, I've been aware of maybe 3 times were moderators got edit participants together to chat out differences. It's very rare - less than once a year is what I see.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's also worth mentioning that repeated rollbacks causes an automatic moderator flag on the post.


















Please remove https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-betahttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-beta

Could those get better ordering than "what is beta"?


















I am really getting tired of flags getting rejected when they are clearly in the scope of what the flag was intended for.

For example:

Not An Answer:

This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question. It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether.

If the "Answer" takes the form of "Hey I tried it, and it worked" or even "Hey I tried it, it didn't work for me but this did" then it should be a comment to the original answer, and not an answer.

These usually take the form of first posts or late answers, which generally means that the user doesn't have the reputation to comment. That doesn't mean that a valid flag should be rejected just so that they can get around the reputation restriction.

And the use of "Flags should not be used to point out technical inaccuracies" is absolutely the wrong approach to take. Answers on SE are supposed to be Peer Reviewed, meaning that the presumption is that answers that are left standing have been found to be accurate. Not addressing flags for Technical inaccuracies, especially for First Posts, where there is likely no hope that the poster will return to make suggested changes, is tantamount to circumventing the Peer Review process.

If there is something redeeming about the answer and it warrants and edit, then an edit is more appropriate, but if the edit would add nothing to the discussion or would only have to reiterate and answer already given, then a flag to delete should be honored.

Can you link to an example that you flagged as NAA, and your flag was declined, and you think it should not have been?  If the answer no longer exists, can you quote the entire text of the answer?  Also I think you should separate "Hey I tried it and it worked" from "Flags should not be used to point out technical inaccuracies".  Those are two separate issues.  The former sounds like something that could be discussed, depending on the specifics, but the second isn't how Stack Exchange works.


















It's absolutely on topic. With a few exceptions there's an OR clause between the following:


Apple Hardware 
Apple Software
Apple Services


See https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic

Even third party products when the use of them involves Apple products in some obvious and clear manner we allow those questions too. The only thing that's off topic is if the use of Apple HW/SW/Services is in passing. The question does need to revolve centrally around use of some Apple thing to fly - but other than that, it's game on for Windows questions about iTunes.

Now just being on topic isn't enough and it's so bad it needs to be put on hold for improvement.

It's unclear (we don't know what version of windows and iTunes is in play, we don't know what the error is, we don't know a ton of things). For that reason, I voted to close it as too broad. Someone could write an entire book of all the steps needed to cover all the eventualities, but it's up the the OP to fill in the details or someone to adopt the question and make up / fill in their specific details and it might be fine to reopen. 

It also might be SuperUser material and off topic once the actual details are listed.

That's definitively flag-worthy, as are all other answers which basically lead people offsite for the details.

I agree and I think we should follow the same practice that we use for iPhone and iOS. Thus we should have at a high level https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-watchapple-watch for hardware and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchoswatchos for software. Also we should have break downs for watchOS so there should be https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos-1watchos-1 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos-2watchos-2, just like iOS. The only issue I see is that down-cased watchOS is a little hard to read.

Also I don't see why https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/workout.appworkout.app is a synonym of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-watchapple-watch. That needs to be fixed too.

We have too many tags already.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel I think it makes it much simpler to see what is a hardware issue and what is a software issue. Also why not be consistent and preemptive for when the next watch is release. It seems like it would be a big mess to untangle the tags after the fact. Also I think it is a good idea to follow StackOverflow's lead here which is to map tags to Wikipedia articles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOSb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Steve Moser Yeah, like you said if the ios tag and iphone tag are separate, I don't see why the watchos tag and the apple-watch tag shouldn't be separate, too.


















Let me try :-)

Ok so far? Or is there any special meaning of using <pre> tags?

The easiest way to format larger blocks of code is to just paste the code into the edit window, select the whole code block and the click on the code formatter ({}) at the top of the edit window.

For me I nearly type it automatically when including code. Hence I never imagined I would need any button to perform such a basic markup.(missing return) To give you an example in another field which is boring me to great deepths, I would never look for a button which would permit me to put a [return] :).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You don't need to use the button, you can just prepend 4 space characters on every line. But for long blocks of code, using the button may be easier, especially if you paste whole scripts into the edit window.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't like the prepend trick: too slow, and too error prone. Honestly I don't find anything simpler than a plain ``…`` :(.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let me try to formulate my thoughts it in a way to make something useful: would it be possible, easy, to make standard ``…`` or ``...`` work?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not a developer here :-) To make a feature request, you can always ask a new meta question, describe the functionality you are missing and add the `feature-request` tag.

Did something break?

This morning there were about 2, now there seem to be 1200 Late Answers.

I don't at a glance see anything that would bring them to review, so I'm suspecting a glitch. They may have been considered late at the time of writing, but there are ones going back several years.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe the rep limit was raised from 10 to 50 and that was combined with a month of reviews being dumped in the queue at once. Also, it appears that the change was intentional and we should work through the queue as a community. Feel free to ignore the review tab and not over-eat from the buffet of answers. Gavage isn't pretty...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ahaah! Yes, I'd been going through trying to see a commonality & now you mention it - low rep users' answers.

Very many of them so far have been reasonable to good answers, some with a decent number of upvotes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike see the comments in the meta question - the programmer did not understand how things work and the queue is not just last months


















This appears to be intentional. As of 1700 UTC October 8, the backlog queue has been reviewed. The site-wide change is being discussed in this answer/question:


https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/267080/165931https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/267080/165931



  I'd like to try raising the reputation for getting enqueued to the Late Answer reviews to 50 and reconsider upping it to 100 at some point in the future


If there's a big problem with this change, asking on MSE directly or here would be ideal.

Personally, I'm seeing a majority of answers that deserve up votes. A few answers that are spam/terrible, but the real benefit I'm seeing is giving attention to the questions themselves. Most of the bad answers are due to a bad question, so I'm cleaning them up when I find a bad late answer as well.

When the OP doesn't accept an answer, it encourages late answers, so I'll encourage everyone that reviews to take their time on this large queue and really give each post some attention before moving to the next review.

I see lots of encouragement to be offered in addition to delete/comment/down vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5for sure. It's rare that such a disparate collection of older Q/As gets a *real* review. My initial foray into this was to try to determine **why** they'd been queued. After your answer to my rather stunned initial question, my review process has taken on a whole new vein - though I may have 'wasted' some of my early attempts, in the confusion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is not a month's worth so,e are years oldb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mark it is a months worth according to the person that wrote the code and made the change. We are seeing the oldest 1.2 k of the tasks that now need to be reviewed. The code doesn't dump more  items into one queue due to reviewer fatigue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**"Intentional"** means, yes, this is a well-known, but temporary issue. The change took effect going back to the start of the site, but once all the current reviews are completed, the effect of the change should be only a few extra answers on the queue every now and then. It should *not* be a continual flood of tasks like you see here. Sorry about the alarm.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RobertCartaino as astonishing as the queue was, I see this "dump" as a wholly positive thing for the site. Practice makes a better practitioner, so I'm seeing far higher quality reviews from people that now have a few hundred tasks under their belt. Plus lots of voting up of good answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Awesome. That is great to hear!

There used to be an issue where, if your account had no activity in any badge, and you opened the tag badge selector, your tag badge tracker would become hidden and you couldn't select a new tag badge. This is apparently what happened to your profile.

I've reset the tracker for your profile so you can select a tag badge now.

To me, there are enough differences with prior versions of Safari  and Safari 9 that a [safari-9] tag is worthwhile.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag request: safari-9b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Other than the Cmd-(1,2,3...) stuff and pinned tabs, what changed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. My brain's fuzzy logic circuits are telling me we're going to see a lot more hidden differences come out because Safari updates were an item during the WWDC 2015 Keynote speech. Also, as site traffic increases version segregation will become more important. Official list: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.htmlb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm generally well opposed to sub-dividing things along version lines tags like this without _very_ good reasons to do so. It doesn't help with discoverability and it only confuses newer users trying to do the right thing with tags. Unlike operating systems, program rarely get the kind of updates that require separate, versioned tags like this. I've asked the other mods to consider this request as well. We should always have as few tags as possible and not one more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't see how the changes in Safari 9 validate a dedicated tag (we didn't add one when Safari got extensions and it didn't hurt either). Having version-specific tags on their own will primarily confuse users (most of them probably don't even know which Safari version they are using (hey, even I don't)).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough. Sound arguments. I apologize for jumping the gun on this request. I'm used to the volume of questions of Stack Overflow where a version tags for things like Xcode really help find pertinent answers. But I see now that the general [safari] tag only has <2K questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Jeff - +1 from me. Even though the current answer is "no" - it's very good to have discussions here on meta to clarify thinking on tags. (I know a meta down vote means I don't want to see this implemented, but I can't help but encourage discussion here on something actually very needed for people using the site which is community tag curation.)

More than once I've run into a question in First Posts which I knew the answer to, and have popped open the question in a new tab to submit one.

Well, there's no button in the queue for actually taking you to the main question page or submitting an answer, and I'm just wondering if there's a reason for this :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it considered bad form to answer questions out of the review queue?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*"there's no button in the queue for actually taking you to the main question page"* There's a purpose-built 'link' link on the right :)


















I don't think it was intentional that there's no way to contribute an answer when you're perusing the review queue. I think it was just a purpose-built UI; it was made for reviews and not reviews-and-possibly-answering.

I certainly don't think it's bad form to provide an answer to question. Ever. That's the whole reason the site exists. If you can help a person out with your knowledge I say go for it.

Also, in most of review situations, if you mouse over the question title it'll let you open the question. I'll pop questions in to background tabs as I'm reviewing and revisit them when I'm done to answer or comment or improve them beyond what the review tasks were asking me to do.

This entire QA, including all 3 answers & a myriad comments, is more of an online troubleshooting conversation than a true QA. 

The final answer I feel was worth the journey, even if the OP didn't actually help a great deal in the process - most of the replies were along the lines of "it no werky"

Serves me right, I suppose, but sometimes tenacity pays off - even if the OP has now wandered off & the final answer will probably never be marked as correct.

I think we now have a nice answer to the reworded title, how to look for a checkmark on a menu item & only perform an action if true/false
It's certainly something I didn't know how to do until now & it is likely to be something I'm going to recycle in future.

Anyone have any suggestions - or even a burning desire to edit it into shape?
I'm not really sure what should stay or go - for instance, my entire first answer ends up not being what the OP wanted because of the, at that time, uncertainty of the initial toggle state.

Alternatively, should I abandon this to the mists of time & just make a new QA that simply asks & answers the underlying question of how to check & act on a menu toggle?
I reverted the title in anticipation of this alternative solution.

I've been encountering a few items in the first posts queue which I'm not sure what to do with.

They generally take the form of "to add on to (someone else)'s answer... etc".

I've been just marking these as No Action Needed since they sort of answer the stated question, yet would be unable to stand on their own without the existence of another answer.

Part of me thinks that these should be flagged no answer as it's something that would be better for a comment - hence the question:

Do answers need to be able to stand on their own, or is building on another answer acceptable?

I also posted this on the Apple Community forum for iTunes, and received a reply from a high-rank user (turingtest2). His suggestion was to file a bug report via Apple Developer Connection, which I have done.  I also self-answered the AskDifferent post to that effect.

Does the original question (and answer) have any value in AskDifferent, or should I delete the question?

That way when the bug gets fixed, someone can edit what version of the software fixes things. Apple's discussions aren't curated, improved, edited - so having the same post here and there is of great value to everyone searching for clear and updated answers.


















It's still a worthwhile question. Many bugs have workarounds which make for good answers to such questions. I'd recommend leaving the question up and updating the answer if it is fixed or providing another answer if a workaround is found.

I would ask another question referring to the original for Lion but in the new question state what OS you need it for (in this case cheat and ask for the first one you know it works on)

There's dozens of posts on the topic, some duplicates of eachother, and it seems to me they'd be useful centralized.


















The following 2 questions are essentially duplicates, along the lines of
'Cannot sign out of iCloud because of an old email address'

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/210728/unable-to-sign-out-of-icloud-linked-to-old-email-that-no-longer-exists?lq=1Unable to sign out of iCloud; linked to old email that no longer exists
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/211906/icloud-catch-22-cannot-sign-out-of-old-dead-apple-id-on-ipadsiCloud Catch 22 - Cannot sign out of old dead Apple ID on iPads

For the first, the solution was 'this is a bug that needs fixing'
For the second, it's 'there now is a solution since iOS 9.0.2'

So, the first did all the work, yet the second found the fix.

imho, both are worthy in & of themselves, but as a pair they show not only the solution, but also some back history to the problem & research done in trying to fix it.

I've already added a comment to the first to point to the newly-available solution.
They each show as 'Linked' in the right margin - though I'm not sure how many people actually use that to follow a trail of bread crumbs.

How do we better link them without 'penalising' either by marking it as a dupe? Especially as it's the newer question that has a working fix, so the 'this has  already been asked & has an answer' message would give off all the wrong signals.  

Add a Link in an answer - edit the original or post a new one?

Add a Link to the top of the original question "Since iOS 9.0.2 there is now a solution to this issue 'here'" ?

Any other possibility?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Linking questions without 'penalising' one as a duplicateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can probably forget this specific issue, as the 2 are apparently not equivalent, but I'll leave it here if anyone has a general answer rather than a specific one.


















I didn't look into the dupe-worthiness of the two questions mentioned, the following is rather a general answer.

Avoiding redundancy by closing duplicate questions is actually a good thing. There is no such thing as a penalty if a question gets marked as a duplicate. Any reputation gained by upvotes on either the duplicate question or one of its answers remain. Also, there is no ownership on posts (see https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editinghttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editing), so if anybody gets an ego problem from having a question closed as a duplicate, he/she better deals with this off-site.

If you run into potential duplicates, by all means either propose to close, comment or flag them. In cases where it make sense, the mods also have the option to physically merge all the answers from both questions into one (which may keep things a bit more tidy especially if the newer question got the better answers).

PS: Oh, and whatever you do: DO NOT edit the question to include the answer (or a link to an answer). It heavily confuses people and the search functionality. Either flag as a duplicate, add a question comment with the link or post an answer pointing to the actual answer (which is one of the very few occasions where a link-only answer is ok IMHO).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Linking questions serves a valuable function. Not everyone uses the same language to describe the underlying function. Linking serves to concentrate the community effort to answering authoritatively on one thread and having those answers searchable using a variety of phrasings. I don't see questions as penalized when closed as they still can be edited, commented upon and revived if in fact the question (or the understanding of it) changes after the vote to close.

I'm not the designer (and certainly won't speak for them), but it could be many reasons starting with Apple's logo from 1977. I actually hope it's many reasons - but does it even matter why?

As on any other SE site, comments to explain down votes are not mandatory. And the two discussions you've linked (as well as several others on various meta sites) list both the pros and cons of enforcing, encouraging or nudging users to comment in case of down votes. That's why users with rep below 2k get displayed a nudge/short note when down voting (which still doesn't make it mandatory though).

OTOH I agree that users would benefit from having down votes explained (in a fashion helping them to improve their posts). But that's up to the individual applying the down vote.

Also - remember that votes are designed to be issued against posts and without regard to the user - so if you can focus on the content of the post and improve it or be kind - that works best for the site and especially so when the poster is a new user.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, the robo-user Community♦ auto-flags posts it believes to be of low quality, and if the flag is marked useful by a moderator, the Community♦ user auto-downvotes the post in question. Without a comment.


















Only the user asking the question can accept one of the answers. Once the user decided to delete his/her account, there is no other way to answer acceptance. The same actually happens if the asker just looses interest and never comes back to the site. See https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18312/moderators-accepting-answers-on-users-behalf-after-a-certain-time-periodModerators accepting answers on user's behalf after a certain time period to understand why even moderators can't (and shouldn't) accept answers in such cases.

This doesn't prevent other users from up (and down) voting the answers given, so even with the original asker gone missing good answers should get upvoted over time.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm thinking it could be a solution that if one of the editors of the question and have high enough rep. could take ownership of the question in case of a user deletion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JoachimBratteli Since this is a site-wide design, you could certainly ask for that feature to be implemented on http://meta.stackexchange.com/ - Perhaps you'd bundle it with the gold category badge for a tag like one-vote close as duplicate? I would focus on the benefit you see by adding that code to the UI. The developers get lots of suggestions, but the community generally doesn't back with votes ones that don't clearly fix a problem that's commonly experienced.


















Ideally, two things happen to abandoned questions. Abandonment happens when the user never comes back or in a more permanent manner when the user account becomes deleted. At that point, the text still belongs to the community - so there's nothing preventing someone from re-asking the same question and explaining why having a check mark is important to the community. We have the power to address this, but it seems overkill for the "reward" in most cases. Without any user action, the design for abandoned questions is:


If they are poor quality, they get edited or down voted - all by user action and user-moderation.
Answers that are good in the sense that someone searches for the question or answer, finds it and votes it up.


The price of entry to allowing anyone to ask a question is that a regular community member isn't going to ask the majority of the questions. Hopefully, site search is designed to counter act this natural tendency. Your actions of editing the question and adding an answer speak to how abandoned questions can still be cared for.

Maybe the acceptance-function should belong to the community as well? I do not have the answer to this, but I see that it is a problem when the acceptance is a part of the "reward" for making answers. Would people choose not to answer questions were they do not have a chance to get that "reward"?


















I don't know if this is a bug or some loading/cloudflare configuration issue, but I've been having sporadic slowness on the site the past 4 hours (Tue Nov 17 16:25:40 UTC 2015) on Safari Version 9.0.2 (11601.3.9).

Specifically, when looking at questions (not the main site pages), page rendering is blocked by query.min.js not being cached and taking more than 15 seconds to load (most of the time when it takes that long, it will never end up loading)

The rest of the network times look fine, and I do use ghostly extension - but disabling that doesn't seem to affect this issue.

I've encountered a weird situation where a user wants to edit a question to (essentially) suit his answer.

The original question is here:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94282/how-to-block-internet-traffic-of-an-application-not-using-little-snitch/193179Which free alternatives to Little Snitch can I use to block internet traffic per applications?

The original question was merely titled "How to block internet traffic of an application", but the body of the question stated: "Little Snitch can block internet traffic of a particular app. Can I do something similar without (paying) Little Snitch?"

So, in short, it was asking for a free alternative to the well known Little Snitch app.

The answer in question is here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/193179/22563https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/193179/22563

The answer simply recommends using Little Snitch, ignoring the asker's awareness of it, and request for an alternative.

I downvoted the answer and let the answerer know why. 

He's now suggesting the question be changed so that it "removes any references to a particular software" so that a reader "can then simply ignore the answer that already mentions the option that [they] do not care about".

I can see validity in this, however I wonder if it's changing the original question too much? Is it like changing a question like "What is a free alternative to Photoshop" to "Give me a list of photo manipulation software (paid or unpaid)?"

How much should we change original questions?

Edit: It's worth noting that a knock-on effect of changing the question in the way suggested would mean that the following question would no longer be a duplicate: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128835/free-firewall-and-network-monitor-application-like-the-littlesnitch?lq=1Free firewall and network monitor Application like the LittleSnitch?

In this specific case, the question was actually not broadened by the edit of the title. If you look at the edit history of the question, the requirement for a non-Little Snitch solution was part of the initial question already, the edit merely put it into the title. The wording is a bit unfortunate now, I would probably have used something like "Which free alternatives to Little Snitch can I use to block internet traffic per applications" (actually, I've just edited the question accordingly).

Generally speaking, any edits should keep the original intention of the poster in mind. For edits which get placed in the edit queue, we even have a rejection reason if an edit conflicts with the intention of the OP. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That initial (and unfortunate) edit was done because the answerer believed that he only needed to answer the *title* of a question, and so it should be placed there. (Not something I agreed with myself.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also if the question did not mention Little Snitch then the question would have to be edited to explain what functionality was required i.e. removing Little Snitch from the question makes it closable for "unclear what you're asking"


















In addition to what patrix mentioned - I like to keep in mind the purpose of a post:


the site exists to draw the best answers, therefore questions exist to serve the answers 


So, add in some other facts:


This question has many answers that are good
This question is 3 years old now


At that point in a question's life cycle, I'm heavily of the mind that locking the question and having it serve the community is the best choice in most of the cases. That allows a meta discussion to see if everyone can come to an agreement on the best way to handle this specific situation.

If someone, even the OP wants to change things so that answers need to be changed, it's probably best to ask a new question at that point. 

The canonical question process is also something to think about where sometimes a post is locked and used to cover all the bases.


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2418/where-is-the-list-of-canonical-questions-stored-for-ask-differentWhere is the list of canonical questions stored for Ask Different?


In that case, the follow on effect you mention is worth considering, so looking at the role of the posts sometimes helps to make editing decisions and/or reply when one person has a vision for the question that others (answerers, reviewers, moderators) see a different vision of the scope or the wording.

Also, people who know all about iTunes and music listening software don't necessarily know anything about music making. They're two different worlds. In that sense, if the tag "music" can refer to both, it definitely is too broad and therefore a bit misleading. "Music-players" and "music-production" might be options, but as long double word tags, they don't look too neat.

The recipe for asking about troubleshooting is pretty easy once you've seen it work.

Everything is in the help section on how to ask a good question.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask


Just show your exact search terms on what you looked for and be narrow about the issue. You want to focus people on asking how to determine if a printer supports bonjour or how to set up a printer so that you don't have to use an IP address.

Using chat or a discussion forum might help you winnow down what you really are asking. Also, sometimes just "how can tell if printer XYZ should be discoverable by OS X version ABC" with you documenting what search you did on Apple and Brother's site makes it answerable.

The old solutions are not broken; the new operating systems are :-)

The posted solutions are still quite valid for computers running the operating systems for which the answers were written. I don't see any reason to break the answers for people running Panther or Tiger or Leopard or Snow Leopard or Lion or Mountain Lion or…

If one wanted to edit additional information into the answers to make them compatible with these newfangled operating systems that aren't named after cats, I suppose one could do that, but don't break answers that work fine for the systems for which they were intended.

If there are problems with the old question (no user to accept an answer, problematic length-too long, asks several questions, rambles and especially if the answers are off-track mostly) - better to make a new question and link in the body explaining that 10.11 seems to be the time when whatever "broke"

There was a Question recently involving a water-spill on a Macbook. We do see a lot of these & linking them is not particularly easy as the symptoms tend to be different.

This Question -

has a great answer, a little harsh, but really hitting the spot on "what to do after a water spill"

I'm aware that to just leap right in & completely change the OP's post wouldn't really be right, but this feels like one occasion where the answer is canonical enough that it's worth looking at.

I'm not sure, even with consensus, it's one I'd like to tackle myself, but if a mod were to point it in the right direction that would feel more acceptable.

Or am I on the wrong track?

This looks like exactly the correct thing to do. (In this case I don't have a printer and I don't know what is correct)

You definitely should not edit an answer you think is wrong as that changes the original intent (and it might be in other cases you have misunderstood) so adding a new answer and possibly down voting the other is correct.

If there is an answer that you think is correct you can edit it to improve it. However in this case you have much more information and the other is just a short piece then adding a new answer is best practise. Also you did a very good thing in acknowledging the first correct answer and explaining why you were adding as a new answer.

If this is the information you can give in an answer I look forward to seeing more of your answers.

As the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contacts.appcontacts.app tag wiki clearly states, it is a simple rename of the same thing.


Feature Request: Merge the two, and create a synonym for the other.



Edit:  I'm not saying these are the only tags that need it - go ahead and merge the others as well! :)

Overdue, wouldn't you say? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will create "address-book" as tag synonym for "contacts" as soon I can as I'm one vote short on my answers for "contacts"-tagged posts in order to create tag synonyms for it. I do agree that the tags need to be merged, as all it is is an old name for Contacts.app.


















My instinct is that this is a good thing, but I'm not convinced about what I feel about this, particularly if you're limiting this to the tags in your question.

There's a few tags that exist like this, where the different tags refer to different versions of the software, delineated by its name change.

If you're going to synonym one pair, might as well synonym all the pairs?

None of them have used their name since 10.7. I don't think that we should have separate vote counts for the same software under an old name.


















If you search https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jailbreakjailbreak, you find 601 questions at time of writing related to jailbreaking one's device.

This is covered (for all SE sites) in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/domain-names-the-wrong-question/this blog post.

I believe SO, SU, AskUbuntu, and any others have those names purely for historical reasons. SO because it's SO; I think AU was independent before it joined SE; not sure about SU, maybe just because it's old enough to have slipped through.

That's actually how the site works:

The latest meta question on beta is https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2537/should-beta-os-questions-be-on-topic-due-to-nda-changes-widening-distribution?lq=1here

The most upvoted answer (although not very many votes) says


  NDA is just one of several reasons why questions about non-public beta software don't work well on Ask Different, Can I ask about not-yet-publicly released OS? lists the others. So even with the NDA partially lifted, I still think that questions about iOS 9/OS X El Capitan need to wait until at least public betas are available.

TLDR: questions should not be closed only because beta software is involved.

You must be specific about beta versions and builds as “the first beta” is not enough. Try Ventura Beta 2 (22A5286j) or posting the sw_vers or equivalent for other platforms is appreciated.

Bonus tip: Try to detail exactly why you need help here rather than the NDA-friendly options most companies establish for beta feedback and developer / seed bug reporting.
Be aware, that many people here don’t wish to see beta problems since it dilutes the long term usefulness of the site since many wait for bugs and documentation to be complete before running software. Use the beta tag if in doubt, please.

The general beta software ban was lifted in August of 2015 after discussing it in chat and on beta. The FAQ is up to date:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic

Developer betas, seeding betas, other odd builds from Apple shouldn't be the only reason to close a post on Ask Different. Beta should no longer a reason to close any question on the site.
See the blog post:

http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/

Meta has lots of answers and discussions, but in general we aren't closing anything due to beta status of hardware, software or services. We are asking for more details on beta releases. For instance - saying El Capitan wasn't enough when it was in beta - we asked for build versions and where you got the beta in the cases where it mattered if you were a seed participant or open beta participant or paid developer. Some things changed based on how you got the beta and were germane to the question meeting quality standards.
Please note, this also doesn't mean any question about beta should remain open. Since it's beta, knowing the exact build version is imperative - we should be a little more strict about closing vague beta questions if they fail the other guidelines about being clear, practical, and have some research done on the problem to be solved.
We should vote to hold and close subjective, opinionated, excessively broad bad questions because of those specific flaws and not because they are running a beta build of an App or an OS.

Sorry, I couldn't think up of a burnination zinger.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photosphotos is ambiguous, as people may think it refers to the photos OS X application.

It should be renamed to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photographsphotographs to avoid ambiguity.

There was a previous request to change it as an answer by the OP of https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2455/synonym-for-photos-app-to-photosSynonym for photos.app to photos , but underneath that answer was a comment suggesting using the tag chat room (now frozen) or another question to discuss it.

If you are talking about the 100 rep association bonus: you only get that once per site, when you sign up for a site and already have at least 200 rep on another SE site. See https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputationhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation for the official documentation on this:


  If you are an experienced Stack Exchange network user with 200 or more reputation on at least one site, you will receive a starting +100 reputation bonus to get you past basic new user restrictions. This will happen automatically on all current Stack Exchange sites where you have an account, and on any other Stack Exchange sites at the time you log in.


There is also http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/ but this probably was more important when cross site associations were introduced than today.

I thought that I could earn 100 more for each website in which I obtained 200 rep.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not a way to earn rep per se. It's just a way to give you basic participation rights on all sites once you passed the limit on at least one.


















From https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic:


  We do encourage AppleScript, Automator, and UNIX shell scripting questions as well as how to use tools like Xcode for non-language specific tasks


So yes these kind of questions are absolutely on topic here. 

Now, if the question is: Should we allow them in the future? Opinions may differ, but from my point of view it's often rather difficult to differentiate between scripting questions around specific OS X features (e.g. how can I list all connected USB devices) and questions which are generic enough to belong to another site (most probably Unix & Linux). Also, if the question does require a very detailed Unix knowhow not available on AD, we still can migrate it over if it doesn't get answered in due time. In other words: I don't see a pressing need to change the policy here.

Just because command line tools such as these are also used in other OS, often for much longer than they have been in OS X, doesn't mean they are not a part of OS X, provided, supported, licensed and documented from Apple directly.

A lot of the time where this sort of thing could be applicable to many SE sites, it comes down to where the OP feels most comfortable asking. If someone has a question on ping or similar, but they happen to be using a Mac, then I'd feel bad pointing them at SuperUser where they might get savaged (for want of X better phrase)

There is this https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/223795/237answer that is only a link. patrix has left a standard comment 


  Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone


If this was on a low quality queue I could vote to delete.

However the wording for low quality flag is 


  This answer has severe formatting or content problems. This answer is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed.


Well these link only questions are obviously fixable by editing the information in so this is not a valid flag

The not an answer flag says


  This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question. It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether.


These links are surely delete altogether. So  this is the obvious flag to use. but as in this question these flags are rejected.

How do I get the answer deleted as link only - I know this is the thing that is needed,
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I delete an answer which is link only?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this up.


















I've declined the flag with "flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies, or an altogether wrong answer". May be a borderline case, but usually I try to refrain from deleting an answer even if it doesn't directly answer the question. In this case the key issue is that it is link-only, the linked project most probably seems to offer an alternative to the tool the asker is using to run WhatsApp. Which, in my eyes, makes it an answer with quality issues, but not necessarily something I would want to delete.

Let's look at the two flags which could be applied here:


  This answer has severe formatting or content problems. This answer is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed.


While I agree that it has severe problems in its current form, the question seems salvageable through editing (basically by just summarizing the README.me found on Github).


  This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question. It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether.


It definitively is an attempt to answer the question (or in this case rather the question behind the question), even it doesn't directly address the problem described.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But if in Low quality queue would be an automatic choice to delete. I don't see any possibility of a choice here either it is link only or it has other info than a link (An issue here is there is no way to flag the author to tell them to expand the answer without flag for low quality) and rejected flags impact me so the unclear areas seem poorb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've expanded my answer a bit. The usual way to notify users is actually to comment/down vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and that is the issue - the flags don't seem reasonable - but the delete reason is obvious and seems to be an absolute decision is it just a link or not - how do I get to it reliably - given your comment re the LQ flag the delete option should not be on the LQ queueb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Typical LQ queue entries include "I have this problem, too" and "Apple is crap" postings, which definitively are candidates for deletion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I meant delete as is just a link which is the option in the LQ queueb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, deletion is an option in the LQ queue, but IMHO this doesn't imply that every queue entry is a candidate for deletion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, just to double check, the policy on Ask Different is to not to follow the standard SE policy that link-only answers are NAA? References: [Your answer is in another castle: when is an answer not an answer?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370) and [Are answers that just contain links elsewhere really "good answers"?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makyen Sites are free to set their own rules. I‘m not sure there is a big difference anyway, at least not to the two questions you‘ve linked to. A link-only answer usually is not a good answer and needs editing, but as long as the linked information is relevant to the question it brings the topic forward (which is what we are looking for). Also, users are more likely to feel welcome if we help them to improve their answers and not just delete things they contributedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't argue for or against any policy here. I only asked for clarification that you were knowingly and intentionally choosing to adopt a policy for this site which is contrary to what the rest of the SE network uses. Frankly, if you are doing so, I'd suggest that you make that crystal clear to everyone. You talk about being welcoming. Doing the opposite of what other sites on the network do alienates those people who come here from other SE sites, particularly when they are not informed of what policies are contrary to their expectations, in advance of them experiencing the contradiction.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mayken Let me look at the two links again, at first glance I didn‘t read them as „all link only answers must be deleted“b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mayken See https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1629/why-was-my-flag-for-not-an-answer-decline, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2801/should-we-flag-different-on-ask-different, and, well, my answer above, on how link-only answers are treated on AD and the rationale behind. In a nutshell: The community here puts more emphasis on improving a (relevant) link-only answer into something useful than in outright deletion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mayken Ah, wasn't aware of the context of your comment, caught up with the comments in Charcoal HQ in the meantime. Establishing a clear policy might be the topic for a new Meta Q/A, but basically we tend to give a poster time to improve the answer instead of outright deleting it. And links to support.apple.com are usually not understood as link-only because any summarization made in the answer will be outdated as soon as Apple updates the support article (which happens quite a lot).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside I just stumbled upon this post as a result of figuring out why my NAA flag [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/440880) was declined. This answer does suggest that NAA flags on such link-only answers may get declined. However, the [FAQ on NAA flags](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1629) indicates that the standard SE policy is also in effect on AD, as per the latest [revision](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/1630/9). This answer, and the FAQ, appear to be in conflict. Am I missing something here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cigien the last paragraph of https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1630/9058 sums it up nicely: if the answer has issues which you as a user can fix yourself, please go ahead and do so. Basically any user is a moderator here after all, most issues can be fixed without the few additional rights elected mods have.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside I'm afraid I don't see how a regular user (or a moderator for that matter) could fix this particular answer. I think I'll go ahead and post a new question on meta seeking clarification on the policy, as doing so in the comments is likely to get unwieldy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cigien It is an attempt to answer the question. Most likely an unsuccessful one, but then flags should be used to flag incorrect or wrong answers. Just downvote and move on.


















As with any other unreleased and unannounced Apple product, questions about an Apple Car, an Apple Mission to the Moon or an Apple Submarine are as off-topic on Ask Different as are questions about the next MacPro model or the future direction of OSX.
The goal of AD (and any other StackExchange site) is to provide fact-based answers to specific problems. There are other sites which are better suited for discussions and speculations (Slashdot, Reddit to just name two).
To look at your examples:

What is Apple doing differently than car manufactures?
Apple is probably doing a lot of things differently, but which problem is to solve here? Also, how can you differentiate a correct answer from an incorrect one?

What parts of a current car dashboard would not agree with Apple’s human interface guidelines?
Interesting question for sure (and something I could absolutely see as a good exam question in an UX/UI course). But even the part that the guidelines would apply to anything car related built by Apple is already speculation.

Which features of Apple hardware have not yet been adapted to mainstream automobiles
Ignoring for the moment what a feature is in this context: which real-world problem does this solve?

If Apple offered a car, would they limit the configuration options to a minimum, like they do with their current computing, entertainment and communication hardware?

From http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic: "Refrain from asking about [...] Pre-release hardware or asking how/why Apple does " and "specific questions about what Apple [did|does|thinks|might do] are not helpful in a Q&A setting since they lack a practical problem to be solved"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So you would consider even “What is currently known about Apple’s ‘Project Titan’?” to be off-topic, because it doesn’t relate to a *practical* problem?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's neither a practical problem relating to the *use* of Apple products nor in fact answerable.

Say I've asked a question which hasn't gotten much attention despite being out for about a week (low view count, no comments or answers etc).

How should I attract attention (besides offering a bounty) to my question, for example, bumping it?

Is there a way to "bump" my quesyion to bring it back to attention? If yes, should I?

edit: the question in question is here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/227875/162909Network Intermittency with Time Machine causes a 'Completed Verification' dialog

I don't think I can afford to make a bounty (yet) but I didn't want to clog up the system with duplicate questions. I'll add a link to my question.


















You should never bump. Community (the Stack Exchange bot) automatically and randomly (fairly) bumps older unanswered questions (questions with zero answers or questions with no answers with a score >1).

If you haven't received an answer you think is suitable, you can refine your question by editing it. Everyone is encouraged to make substantial edits to improve their posts, for example:


Do some research and document how that didn't solve the issue.

Time has passed and it's possible new information or new sources are available. Add links to information you find elsewhere and document what you did and how this doesn't solve the problem for you.

Community doesn't bump questions with an upvoted answer, as this potentially indicates that the answer was found to be useful. If this isn't the case, that would indicate the question may be unclear and imprecise, or a misunderstanding took place — either way, editing the question to resolve this would be necessary to ensure the question is sufficient in describing the problem. Comments are ephemeral: don't just leave a comment on the answer describing a further complication to the question, edit the question.
Add version details to explain the range of OS or apps with the issue.

New versions of OS may have been released in the meantime. Did this update change anything about the problem? If you've got the same problem with the next point release, that's perhaps not worthy of editing. If a (point) release made the problem worse or changed the symptoms, that's useful information that might help solve your problem, or at least find your question through search keywords.
Trim extraneous details in the question

Shorter posts with a single clear request are far more likely to get new answers as it's easier to see what's being asked for directly. Don't let brevity overcome the question and avoid a question looking like an XY problem, but make sure everything in the question relates to the question. If you're providing code, make sure it's https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcveMinimal, Complete and Verifiable.


Share your question using the share link under a post. This provides a handy short link for posting elsewhere, such as on social media, which can help promote it to the audience that can answer.

Bounties are the designed method to attract more attention to your question and this far exceeds the promotion from being on the front page for an hour or so depending on traffic. For more information on how bounties work, see https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/bountyWhat is a bounty?.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/badges/21/tumbleweed Tumbleweed is a badge awarded you if you've ‘asked a question with zero score, no answers, no comments, and low views for a week’. Some people like myself browse the Tumbleweed badge page to see questions which may have fallen through the cracks and edit/answer if possible. This can give questions a boost they may have not had the opportunity for before.

There's two things you can do: comment or edit. There's nothing built-in to Stack Exchange specifically for outdated answer handling. They are still answers and shouldn't be removed, but commenting or editing helps readers by pointing out problems that a user using a newer operating system may face.

With editing, don't put a huge message at the beginning of the answer. This distracts from the content. Instead, inline the new information into the answer, such as changing an answer which begins ‘You can…’ into


  In Yosemite and earlier, you can…


On a previous answer of mine, I edited my accepted answer to explain which versions of OS X my answer worked for, and as an updated answer had already been provided by another user, I linked to that answer too with an extremely brief summary of what was different (in this case, a single string).


  This answer is for Mavericks and earlier.
  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/123833/replace-text-edit-as-the-default-text-editor/220496#220496For Yosemite and later, use com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.


Source: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/123834/37797Replace Text Edit as the default text editor

This way, the answer can standalone if the other answer is removed for any reason (always a good idea for any external content required for the comprehension of an answer) but should a less-experienced user or a user who simply prefers more detailed instructions on the difference, they can check the linked answer.

I'm not aware of any way to edit images within the site. What you can do though:


Download image to your computer
Use the editing tool of your choice to reduze the image size
Edit the original post and replace the image with your reduced-size version

Or after the entire work the edit get rejected?!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Same rules as always apply: Make the edit worthwhile for the time you spend on it, for the time the edit queue reviewers spend on it and the fact that it will push old posts back to the top of the page. If you just reduce picture size in a post which has bigger issues (e.g. it's not clear what the question is about at all, or there is a lot of irrelevant noise in the text, or is years old and has an accepted answer), there is a certain risk that it will get rejected.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The post linked in your question definitively falls into the "a lot of irrelevant noise in the text" category.


















Use img tags with a custom width attribute. In the example you linked to, I've edited it to do just that. Check the revision history to see what I've done.

If you resize an image and re-upload it as a suggested edit, I'm likely to ‘reject and edit’ it and use the above instead on the original image. Resizing the image loses detail.

Feel free to use even smaller numbers for side-by-side images (e.g. 300) and add []() or [][] link formatting around the img element to link  to the full-size image.

A few weeks ago, I suggested a new tag related to 4K. The suggestion had been accepted but right now I don't see the tag anymore.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/151881suggested edit 151881 shows that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4k4k was the tag that was suggested to be added, but the https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/228423/revisionspost revisions shows that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retina-displayretina-display was added. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4k4k was merged with https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retina-displayretina-display, but https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retina-displayretina-display is a synonym of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/displaydisplay, and as such https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/retina-display/synonyms/tags/retina-display/synonyms redirects to https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/display/synonyms/tags/display/synonyms which doesn't show https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4k4k as a synonym, because it isn't.

Here the question is not referring to retina display!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mattia I somewhat agree.

The point is that 4k in most of the cases is not related to Apple displays and to retina-displays. Anyway, I was just wondering why that tag was accepted and than it disappeared.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mattia If display is linked to retina-display - what do you do for external displays or links via HDMI/VGA or just a generic display of a programetc Out of the newest 10 questions tagged display only one might be tagged as retina

The answers are not obsolete; they are great answers for great operating systems. Questions really need to specify for what operating system they seek a solution. If the same solution works for multiple versions, that's awesome. If Apple introduces a disruptive change, the answer doesnt become obsolete, but the adopters of the new system have new questions about how to do what we already have established to do in the earlier versions.

But my eMac running Panther works great. Answers about how to search for files in Panther before Spotlight was introduced aren't obsolete; they just don't apply to people who choose to use those newfangled gizmos.

Otherwise, you end up with duplicate questions with the only difference being the OS version.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But those are then, by definition, not duplicates. Also, @cjm, how do you determine which is the correct answer (the one to get the check mark) if multiple answers are correct for different versions?


















The https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hackintoshhackintosh tag refers to using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware.

I wish you had not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel There were three upvotes on the question indicating support and only two questions tagged with [tag:hackintosh], one of which was closed and the other shouldn't have had the tag in the first place on its own merits.

Upvoting a question doesn't imply support for the proposal described, we usually create a "yes" and a "no" answer for this (sometimes after a lengthy discussion) and have people vote on that.


















I'm usually the one arguing for tags to go away, but in this case, I'd rather see the hackintosh tag stay.


if all posts on the topic are indeed off-topic, the tag will only appear on off-topic posts. If such posts persist in the site, seeng they all have a common theme can help people know what is and is not off-topic
if off-topic posts are naturally deleted over time, the tag will die on its own when no surviving posts remain
our definition of on- and off-topic can change over time, and if posts are tagged as hackintosh, if the site later decides it wants to answer these, the tag marks them as a candidate for potential reopening.


Manually removing the tag from posts on which it belongs strikes me as a bad idea.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand your arguments, but I do still think that burninating [tag:hackintosh] was the right decision.  All of the posts on the topic were indeed off-topic, and I don't see any reason why the off-topic posts should stay.  They also didn't look like they would naturally go away over time.  If [tag:hackintosh]-related questions become on-topic, then I could see the tag coming back.  As it is, I agree with @grgarside that burnination was the proper choice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There should not be off-topic questions posted on the site regardless of how they are tagged. Question askers can ask on meta using [asking-questions] for discussion regarding a potential question. Having a tag ‘just in case’ someone posts an off-topic question is poor practice. The tag *has* died on its own as its use on the two questions that I removed it from used it inappropriately or was closed. Using the tag as a ‘marker’ for later re-opening is ‘meta-tagging’, and such questions shouldn't be posted for the potential that they are later re-opened *if* the site scope changes.

Sorry if the title is not so clear.
Should we remove the questions that are made for the purpose of earn only reputation points? I'm referring to question like these two: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231835/what-are-the-differences-between-the-iphone-se-6s-and-6s-plus?noredirect=1#comment283184_2318351, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231833/what-are-the-differences-between-the-9-7-and-12-9-ipad-pros2.
I mean, are those really necessary for the community? They look like spam to me. Especially because the answer arrive from the person who made the question in only 6 minutes.
Some of you expert can provide me some explanation in order to keep questions like that?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What are the meaning of question to earn reputation?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ultimately every action where you post content on an SE site is done to "earn reputation". Whether that's primary or secondary to learning something or sharing some knowledge is up to the individual and the circumstances when they post here.


















If you disagree with a question you can always flag it for closing. The flags will be reviewed by the moderators and the community users. If enough people agree a question should be closed the system will take care of it; no humans need intervene.

That being said, over time, we've gotten pretty good as a community at recognizing the common questions that occur post-Apple announcement of new products and heading off those questions from very low-rep users with existing self-answered questions.

This is an accepted practice here on Ask Different.

You've provided to examples but they're both slightly different.

In the case of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231835/what-are-the-differences-between-the-iphone-se-6s-and-6s-plusWhat are the differences between the iPhone SE, 6s, and 6s plus? -- the user asked a pretty straight-forward question and self-answered. Nothing wrong with that and it's something that's done post-Apple announcement with some frequency here. There's good prior art for this sort of thing on the site.

And a slight diversion here: answering your own questions is not only okay, it's encouraged by the Stack Exchange system. You have an "answer your own question" box right below the "ask your question" box when you're creating a new question. Stack Exchange exists to capture questions and answers with as few rules as possible. Sometimes people know the question and the answer and why wouldn't we want them to share this knowledge with the world?

However, for the second question you linked to, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231833/what-are-the-differences-between-the-9-7-and-12-9-ipad-prosWhat are the differences between the 9.7“ and 12.9” iPad Pros? -- the asker did not provide an answer. It needs an answer. And it's a legit question. We will see people asking what the differences are between the two models.

The simplicity of a question or the ease with which an answer can be obtained aren't good measures for whether a question should be asked here or not. We certainly don't mind simple or easy-to-answer questions!

I will say that your answer on the "What are the differences between the 9.7“ and 12.9” iPad Pros?" is not a good answer. We strongly discourage "read the text behind a link" answers here. Links rot, which means the text behind them gets lots. Pull the relevant details in to your answer in addition to providing the link would make it a stronger answer.

I was going to use a slightly less-polite term, but I thought better of it.

How do we deal with such as this

where there are 25 answers, almost all pretty low quality, that are essentially all the same answer in varyingly-intelligible forms?

Go down them hitting -1 on the worst & hope they eventually reach -3 & vanish to low rep users?

I just tried to retag a question as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linuxlinux which was based on not finding a Ubuntu boot disk

However I see Linux is a synonym of Unix which surely is wrong for this group as the differences matter a lot here. Can we have this synonym broken?

For example - why any of these would exist as anything but synonyms to [tag:open-source] or [tag:command-line] seems to dilute the power of having tags to follow a topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a difference as in the question I tried to retag and this [one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231490/boot-ubuntu-from-usb-stick-on-2011-macbook-pro) in trying to boot linux or just running linux e.g. getting correct drivers  - as per my earlier comment I think the unix tag helps nothing and user needs to choose command-line or linux or osx. unix cannot be used as a tag for open source as unix contains OSX and is non open source (and linux video drives could be there as well)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't understand why the tags have been lumped together in the first place.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user151019 That follows due to the acronym "Gnu's Nominally Understood-to-be-unix"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dictionarics Anonymous, because [having too many detailed tags is more harmful than useful](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4208/on-ask-different-freebsd-is-a-synonym-of-unix?noredirect=1#comment9437_4209).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VladimirBotka The issue here is that some of these tags do matter as the answers would differ depending on the tag - e.g. in my scenario linux should have different answers to bsd (but we can't split bsd freebsd and macos as they are the same in the mac context) - The other issue is unix is meaningless here - just as apple is - almost every question is unix (classic macos and winws are the exceptions). ALso each site sets its own ruiles there is not common definiotion of a tag across sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You say: *`"We can't split bsd freebsd and macos as they are the same in the mac context"`*. This is not true. *`bsd`* and *`freebsd`* are [synonyms](https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonyms) of [unix](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unix), *`macos`* is not. *`bsd`* and *`freebsd`* are not among the [synonyms](https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/macos/synonyms) of [macos](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macos).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VladimirBotka I am not talking about current synonyms which I agree are wrong - but what should be there.

Here's a question I asked:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/232549/old-ipod-ipod-mini-sales-figureshttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/232549/old-ipod-ipod-mini-sales-figures
It was put On Hold, with this reason chosen:

"Basic Customer Support or questions asking to recommend or find off-site resources (Mac/book/software/tutorial) are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it."

The key part, I assume, is "questions asking to [...] find off-site resources [...] are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam."
There's nothing opinionated about the answer to my question. It's a simple factual question. I tried finding the answer and could not, so I asked.
So far I've only explained why the chosen reason to close is incorrect. I suppose I aught to actually argue that my question does belong. From the Help Center:

Ask Different is for users of Apple products. If you have a question about ...

Apple hardware
[...]

... then you're in the right place to ask your question!

The iPod is Apple hardware, so my question is on-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sales Figures are Off Topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm voting +1 on this - the help center might need some better text to help out on the class of "I want to know how Apple operates / I want to gather information that Apple clearly has but doesn't release" since you're clearly thinking closely about the issues here.


















Off-Topic was probably the wrong reason, but it deserves to be closed (put "On Hold") because Apple has never provided specific sales figures, and also not broken down by iPod type.

It may be on topic, but it's factually unanswerable.

I expect that, similarly, there's probably some less-than-official numbers that are available. IE, maybe in some obscure interview an Apple VP made a passing mention that they had around X sales, or maybe they mentioned that they had twice as many sales one month as another, which is something - more than we have now, which is nothing. We might not know the answer today, but maybe in a few years someone will retire and reveal it. The question is on hold, so we couldn't post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ArtOfWarfare The hold is a temporary situation. The post can be edited and we can also figure out if I missed some aspect of the question and it should be reopened as it stands.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To put the question on hold "because Apple doesn't publish sales figures" rather reeks of affiliation or inappropriate protectionism. Instead, it can be answered that "Apple doesn't publish sales figures" and that reliable figures might therefore not be found in the public domain.


















I found this site in the SE community list. I had to visit the site because the name wasn't descriptive enough to tell me what it was about, and when I did, I was half expecting to end up on a site about alternative lifestyles. 

The argument from SeniorShizzle that "90% of Apple's users over the age of 18 would recognize [the Think Different] slogan immediately" is dubious at best, and at worst it excludes entire geographic regions where the ad was not campaigned, new users, users of Apple products that were not advertised with the "think different" slogan, and generations of users to come. I'd argue that the name is esoteric. And while there are problems with the name "Ask Apple" as discussed in the comments, that doesn't mean there is not a problem with the name "Ask Different".

That being said, I'm not here to support a name change, I'm just offering my two cents on this topic. And while I haven't been a member for very long, I have a different theory as to why the name might have stuck (and why it might be a good match), according to something I remember being told by an old business professor I once had.

According to him, Apple's success has always been fueled by those evangelist users who embrace the fact that Apple is not Microsoft, and historically has never been "mainstream". These users want to be different and feel like they're exercising their right to choose. Perhaps they perceive themselves as the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.

And that's why "Ask Different" is arguably a pretty good name choice for the community here.

But alas, I'm just a passerby.

Basically, questions about scripting solutions based on Bash, AppleScript, Automator etc. (aka everything included in OSX by default) are on-topic. But we also expect askers to show some kind of research and at least an attempt to solve the problem on their own (to avoid "do my homework for me" questions). From a first look, not all of the questions you've listed qualify on that angle.

OTOH, I neither see these questions as a plague nor as a problem. If somehow (maybe just for the fun of it) provides an answer, great, the value of the site just increased. If nobody bothers (because the problem is too obscure, the boundaries not defined very well or the OP doesn't respond to comments asking for clarification), the question will slowly sliver into oblivion which is fine as well.

So basically, IMHO we should treat them like any other question and


ask for clarification if the question is unclear
flag as whatever if necessary
answer if we can

The current CSS design for Ask Different puts Arial first.

I think we should change this CSS to put San Francisco first, without having to license anything or anything like that. Here is my CSS code:

body { font-family: -apple-system, Helvetica Neue, Arial; }


The only problem with this is that -apple-system is only supported on Apple devices and Safari. However, it can default back to Helvetica Neue.

https://github.com/Usernamer/AskDifferent-SanFrancisco/blob/master/script.user.jsI also created a TamperMonkey script with this same behavior

Is there a point when a question gets too old to answer it? Before today, there was no easy way to tell if your iOS device is currently jailbroken, but an iOS security analyst has developed an application you can install that will run all the technical checks it needs to determine if you are jailbroken. There is a very old question about telling if your device is jailbroken here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70809/how-can-i-find-out-if-my-iphone-is-jailbrokenHow can I tell if my iOS device is currently jailbroken?

That question has been answered already and has an accepted answer basically saying that you just check to see if Skype works or not (a very old method to check for jailbreaks that hasn't worked for years).

Should I answer this existing question or ask my own? Are there any general guidelines on this sort of thing?

Sometimes when I make edits to a question or an answer, it is rejected for being "superfluous." Why is that?

Can give a better answer if there's specific context around the question. The general answer is: edits need to be substantial. Simply changing `XCode` to `Xcode` with an edit is going to get it rejected -- it's not significant enough to improve the state of the question or answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I thought the purpose of editing questions and answers is to fix spelling and grammar errors?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, but if you look at [the editing guide](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editing), first and foremost _Edits are expected to be substantial and to leave the post better than you found it._ That's very subjective, but on the whole it usually works out with community-approved edit queues.


















The reason for rejection is pretty clear. Don't just focus on the word ‘superfluous’.


  This edit does not make the post even a little bit easier to read, easier to find, more accurate or more accessible. Changes are either completely superfluous or actively harm readability.


Edits, especially suggested edits, should significantly improve a post's readability or equivalent, and definitely shouldn't be making a post worse.

I've just had a look at every one of your suggested edits, and there's only a couple there that I'd approve. Almost every single one either doesn't help the post in any way or makes the post worse.

Here's a few randomly selected examples from your recent suggestions that illustrate my point:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161967https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161967

You've literally added 6 characters and changed 1 character. That's only just over the required amount to submit the edit. Besides, it hasn't helped anyone — it's not in a title or a critical component of a question or answer which would help search users.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161966https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161966

I am extremely close to reverting this edit. I've reverted this edit. If I could superping, I'd be bringing this up with the users who approved the edit.


The first sentence is no improvement, just a change in style.
The edit to the code is poor (‘killall’ is not equivalent to ‘osascript quit’ and I don't understand why you changed it) and you should not be making changes to code in this way without support in comments or elsewhere.
You added nothing to the third sentence but expanding what was already there, just in more words, which don't improve comprehension and actually make it more confusing as to what's being referred to.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161268https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161268

All you've done is add line breaks. Don't do this — it's worse to read.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161489https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161489

You should not be leaving valedictions on posts, let alone making them bold.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161495https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/161495

What exactly is being improved here? All you've done is change some words to some synonyms, replace ‘the’ with ‘Spotlight’, and incorrectly change one of the questions to something completely different which wasn't what the OP was asking.


I think I've made my point, but if there's any other edits you want discussing specifically, link them. I'm sorry to say I would have edit-banned you a long time ago and brought this up then, but the past month or so I haven't been keeping up with others’ reviews as much as I'd have liked. I strongly suggest reading the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editingediting guide if you haven't already.

As said in the title, there is a major difference between the logos in the two links:

The main issues here are that


the tag descriptions don't give enough guidance (if any at all) on how a tag should be used
most users don't really make a difference between the device (hardware) and the OS (software) ("I have a problem with my iPhone, not with iOS")


Unless you want to update all the relevant tag descriptions, update hundreds of questions and keep monitoring the site to ensure that new users use the proper tag I don't see how this is going to change. To be honest, I also don't see why this would be necessary as the current use of the tags more or less reflects what people are talking about if they have problems with their devices.

Also, from the tag description of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphoneiphone:


  iPhone is Apple's smartphone line. This tag can include questions about hardware, software and accessories.


so at least in this case, using https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphoneiphone for software problems is ok. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And there are IOS software issues that are specific to the iPhone so iPhone tag is **needed** for both software and hardware


















I flagged an https://apple.stackexchange.com/revisions/241791/1original version of a link-only answer as "not an answer" as I have done for hundreds of similar posts on other SE sites. My flag was declined. Then I explained my reasoning and asked about moderator's. This was their response:


  In this case, no flag at all :-) It clearly is an answer, and salvageable by editing, so what would you expect a mod to do here which you can't do yourself?


The first part is debatable. It was discussed in numerous meta posts on other sites and the consensus seems to be on the side of "do flag link-only answers as a non-answers" with this nice https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/305121infographic as an example.

I am puzzled with the latter part of the response:

So far I thought moderators' attention is required when flagging a post for moderator's attention, as a spam, or as rude-or-offensive (with the latter two flags causing deletion also by majority of votes).

However I had an impression that flagging as low quality or flagging as a non-answer directed such posts to the Low Quality Posts review queue where >2000 rep. users could vote for deletion and publish an automatic comment explaining the rules. On all sites on which I have access to these queues, there is an explicit option "this is a link-only answer and not spam" which is not available when flagging.

I thought that by flagging an answer as non-answer or low-quality, I am bringing it to the attention of the community (which gives opportunity to post predefined suggestions, give author time and put an answer subject to democratic voting) not moderators (at least not in the first place).

Is it different on Ask Different?

Why a moderator here suggests that by flagging this post I might have had any expectations of them ("what would you expect a mod to do here")?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we flag different on Ask Different?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have had this before as well. If the answer gets into the low quality queue we can close it but getting it into the queue is random - some moderators reject itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Possible duplicate of [How do I delete an answer which is link only?](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2721/how-do-i-delete-an-answer-which-is-link-only)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark Come on! I ask about the internal mechanisms behind flagging and why moderator feels obliged to respond, not how to deal with link-only answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a side note, on SuperUser recently there was an audit: the question was "from where can I download drivers for ...", the answer was "check this link ...". I pressed "Looks OK" and failed, the post was deleted as link-only. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@techraf Yes on other sites link only answers are usually removed here we have at least one mod who does not and rejects VLQ flags for link only even though the VLQ has the option close as link onlyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then I think the last comment answers the question. It is different and the reason for that is ..., even though mechanisms are the same across SE sites.


















I can't speak for how other sites handle link only flags - but the post you mentioned doesn't seem to meet our standards for general flagging.

If you read https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/flagginghttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/flagging it explains that the primary reason to flag is when you see something bad.

I see no guidance on the site help here where link only answers are prohibited - just as we don't prohibit wrong answers. Those sort of things are designed to be handled through two processes:


Reputation limits make people participate in ways that others will vote and comment when their initial efforts are outside the site norms or objectively not useful. 
Closure and voting and peer moderation handle almost all the cases of people figuring out how to contribute when they don't read the help center on how to make a good question or how to show research. Answers live and die by votes and good questions usually have a handful of thoughtful, useful answers to rise above the rest.


Specifically on Ask Different, we've tried to explain how NAA flags are moderated in this thread:


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1629/why-was-my-flag-for-not-an-answer-declinedWhy was my flag for "not an answer" declined??


Going over that, I would expect the moderator looked a the question (if needed) - it looks decent enough to me. The initial text of the answer is certainly not link only. It also appears to be helpful and relevant to the issue at hand. Best of all, it was a new user that got constructive feedback, took that to heart and there's a pretty decent answer now.

Hopefully this makes sense to your question here. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, my question was if by flagging a post as *low quality* or flagging a post as a *non-answer* I am putting burden on moderators or am I bringing it up for community review, because my understanding was that flagging puts the post in review queue. This answer deals with the example question and refers to guidelines on flagging. Basically it looks like you stopped reading the question after first two paragraphs and decided you must respond to a complaint about declined flag and defend mod's decision.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or I was trying to help, @techraf  - I was focused on your final question: "Is it different on Ask Different?" The beginning of your post wasn't what I was trying to address, but if my post wasn't helpful, I offer a money back guarantee. Perhaps another user will have better advice?


















As documented in https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputationhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation:

You lose reputation when:

your question is voted down: −2
your answer is voted down: −2
you vote down an answer: −1
you place a bounty on a question: − full bounty amount
one of your posts receives 6 spam or offensive flags: −100


The reason downvotes impacts your reputuation is to prevent revenge or mass dowvotes against others. In addition it also emphasis the goal of AD (and SE sites in general) of getting good answers (which for instance means that instead of downvoting a bad answer it might be better both for you and for others to upvote good answers).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If someone else downvotes it as well, that means a variety of people agree, so shouldn't the reputation be awarded back? Also, I don't think 1 reputation would stop people from going on revenge sprees. Also, wouldn't taking reputation away discourage users from downvoting bad answers, and upvote them instead?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I said, upvoting of good answers is prefered over downvoting of bad ones, so in a way this is intentional.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This was also in a situation where there wasn't a good answer yet, and a bad answer shouldn't be displayed as the first.


















Downvotes don't need to be explained and most often aren't. 

The comments below your question addressed an unclarity in the question itself (namely whether the underlying OS is Windows or OS X). I've edited your clarification into the question and removed the comments because the issue discussed in the comments has been resolved.

I take from this that you don't feel the comment was meant as an explanation for a downvote?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hard to say whether they are related.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright :) They came at pretty much the same time.


















With the https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/schedule/#/annual developer conference WWDC starting today for 2016 - Apple is announcing new things. 

Where can we ask / talk / learn more about the live stream of WWDC 2016 on Ask Different?

Anything that isn't covered by the NDA, that's public knowledge, can be asked about on Ask Different.

http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatAsk Different Chat is available for things that don't work as practical questions. Chat is also the best place to discuss the live stream since that part of community doesn't work well as practical Q/A on the main site.

Only the newer versions will be called macOS, the older ones will still be called OS X Cat-of-choice. I would propose to go with a synonom instead of a renaming.

Today (June 2016), the synonym points https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macosmacos -> https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osxosx so that we can decide at a later date to flip things around. If there is an answer that makes a strong argument for never merging the two, we might want to undo the synonym so that the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macosmacos questions are distinct.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which direction would you suggest for the synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looking forward, having `osx` as a synonym for `macOS` is probably the better way (even if it hurts at first :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with Patrix that one tag seems much better for the site. Unless there's a large consensus or some other reasoning we haven't considered, making the swap from mac being a synonym for os to os being a synonym to mac is trivial, instant, and reversible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that legacy software would need a tag as well (ie. Mac OS 9 and older).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with the above posts, the new os should be tagged 'macos' not to be confused with 'osx'. I say that keeping in mind that we are likely to encounter a great many things specific to 'macos' that did not affect or exist in 'osx' over the coming years. Even though some overlap will obviously exist between the two. I agree we should also find a tag for legacy mac software, perhaps 'maclegacy' or 'macclassic', or both as I know 'MacOS9 Classic' was often referred to as 'Classic' when running under OS X 10.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/classic-mac-os already :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I strongly agree that [tag:osx] should be a synonym for [tag:macos] and not the other way around. Apple is starting to retroactively [refer to pre-10.12 releases as macOS](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/256088), so I believe that we should follow their lead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix when should this change occur (or will it)? It always throws me off to see the `osx` tag! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SkeletonBow Stay tuned :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix It was changed! I just saw the answer (and the tag). Ich danke Euch!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SkeletonBow Der Dank gebührt bmike, der hat die Arbeit schlussendlich gemacht :-)


















Thanks for bringing this up on meta so quickly. As already remarked by https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/85275/tetsujin@Tetsujin in the comments:


  We can keep it & link it as a duplicate - which gives Google a greater chance of finding the answer in future. I'll vote to close as a dupe; it doesn't reflect on the quality of the question, merely links it to an existing one with a highly-voted answer.

I think that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osxosx is a decent tag for the most part. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osxosx refers to the modern version(s) of Apple's Operating System, which is titled as OS X. Earlier versions, before the 'OS X' line started (named after the big cats), were simply named Mac OS <insert version name and number here> - 'X' was added after Mac OS version 9. As such, I would think that the tag, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macosmacos would refer to legacy Apple Computer software, instead of newer software. Nonetheless, I would welcome the new tag! :)

I missed that...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think there are any questions here re Mac OS <= 9. Using tacos tag for just these will cause a lot of confusion. Most people won't realise it is for the old OS and most people won't read the tag wiki so no documentation will help. So most things tagged macos will be for the new OS no matter what we dob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark mhmm tacOS :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TopHatProductions115 The X was dropped with macOS 10.12 Sierra, so the macOS tag now refers to OS 9 and 10, depending on the specific version.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In that case, I suppose that a tag like [tag:osx] can only be used for a small range of Operating System versions. Thanks for the update.


















These questions will, unfortunately, remain closed, for two reasons:


Both are shopping questions and https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicshopping questions are off topic for Ask Different. You're asking for a purchase recommendation in both questions. Shopping or buying recommendations. Questions that are mainly about price/time/supply constraints are considered "shopping" questions.
Both are asking for "best" options. While you do give some criteria for filtering purchase options, "best" is ultimately very subjective in these cases and as such there's no, real, canonical answer that can be given and that's not what Stack Exchange is about when it comes to Q&A.


Ultimately these questions are better suited for a traditional discussion forum format. You can find something akin to this in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatour chat room or take advantage of an existing forum like https://www.reddit.com/r/applehttps://www.reddit.com/r/apple.

I think the implicationnis clear, is there hardware that functiona best in both environments.  I'll remove the parts about pricing when I get a chance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A standard keyboard works *best* in both environments, as does a plain vanilla mouse :-) Or in other words: without a clear indication about what "best" means for you and how you want to measure it, "best" always is subjective.


















I found https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/245575/9058an answer like this

This answer is referred to as a low quality answer. The answer (in its original revision) provides no additional detail than a link. If this link were removed, the answer would not be an answer to the question, therefore it is a very low quality answer.

Also, there is value to showing the actual URL - so when you edit a post with a link or insufficient explanation - keeping the URL plain so that someone sees that it points to Apple instead of a scam site has benefit to everyone.

It is preferable to edit the answer to include a summary of the contents of the link, such that if the destination of the link be removed, the answer still makes sense. You are always able to suggest edits at any reputation and this should be your primary resolution.

If you are not able to fix the answer, you should flag as very low quality. This puts the answer in the https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/low-quality-postslow quality posts review queue, available to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edithigher reputation users who can recommend deletion or https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/trusted-uservote to delete.

Given Dragon is multi-platform and the question is about the software I think the question would be better suited for SuperUser.com -- there doesn't appear to be anything Apple-specific about the question.

I asked a question some time ago about dismissing multiple notifications on OS X. I still have the issue, but my question appears to have been deleted.

It's not showing on my recently deleted questions list - I guess it was probably deleted some time ago as well.

Does it still exist somewhere? Can anyone tell if/why it was deleted? I know I did get a couple of "random" downvotes at one point, so it may have been at -1 - would that, combined with low activity, have been sufficient for it to have been automatically deleted at some point?

I'm aware they probably won't get much attention as they are pretty niche, but I believe them to be valid and on-topic, and at least if they're left open it's vaguely possible that someone will find them via google at some point and I might get an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(BTW, the only reason I'm not marking this accepted is that it still implies I should be able to see my deleted questions on the list (still not sure what the reasoning is behind hiding them from the author, but that's another discussion))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@CupawnTae I've updated the answer with a link to the related question on the Meta site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix great stuff, thanks again - intentional and highly unpopular by the looks of it.


















Your linked answer is a community wiki post. One of the effects of this is that  you receive no reputation for the post, positive or negative. This is indicated by the different style of author link at the bottom of the post.

                                                             

Answers can be made community wiki specifically using the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/community-wikicommunity wiki checkbox under the answer once you reach 10 reputation, however in this case the answer was automatically converted to community wiki as the question is community wiki. There are extremely few community wiki questions on the site (0.12% of questions are community wiki at the moment).

FWIW, I don't remember what in the interface indicated or determined that I should use the "bug" tag while I was writing my question. (I hope the question showed that I was admitting my ignorance, and did not assume that it was a bug.) But I was basically made to add the bug tag before I could submit it, even though I had supplied other tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@David All meta questions must be tagged with at least one of the dark grey required tags which are [meta-tag:discussion], [meta-tag:support], [meta-tag:bug] and [meta-tag:feature-request]. This is why those four tags pop up when focusing on the tag box (unlike the main site) and why a red alert appears when attempting to submit a meta question without a required tag.

Neither.

Anonymous feedback (positive and negative) is in a different bin and affects things like placement on the home page, search results, etc.. but it doesn't grant direct reputation.

You can look at this https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputationhelp section to see how reputation works in specific.

I did read that page, and maybe I'm over looking it, but I could find anything about votes given before my reputation is high enough. And when you say "neither" does that mean that I can not go back and vote again? Is there any way for the write to gain the reputation from my vote?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@boredrandom The first link in that document covers reputation generally. You're not voting up with 10 rep - it's the same as anonymous feedback. You don't get a "vote" until you have 15 rep. You have feedback that's positive or negative - that's all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you. That's the part I wasn't understanding, that it's equivalent to being anonymous, that it's not even a vote.


















Three part questions almost always get closed - so that's the worst thing to do.

Look at the first version of this post:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/247506/5472https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/247506/5472


Three questions, boom, boom, boom. If there is specificity and research, none is shown. It shows an attempt to reason through an issue, but needs to be distilled and honed and work done to identify one thing that's answerable.

Now - just splitting it up into three questions is still going to have them closed - but at least each closure will be specific and easier for the asker to remedy. (or for everyone to realize that it shouldn't have been asked like "is this a common problem" since it's not the type of practical question the site is designed to host.

Unless you can be sure you have enough detail to get at each question alone, try to ask the first and most basic question and then wait to get an answer or answers. Then you can build / refine the next part of the issue. 

I've rarely seen three related questions work - but most of the time, asking three very close questions also results in closure / holds.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, i understand the 'building on to it' part. But what if the first or second part gets a really good answer? I can only mark one as the answer. Would adding to the question at that point still be a good idea?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Part one should be asked and get a good answer with a check. Then part two gets asked (alone / new thread) and gets a good answer with a check. You can always edit a link between posts so that they are searchable, @boredrandomb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or, to put it the other way round: Once you've got your first question answered, create a second question for the next part, **do not** edit the first question to extend it.


















I'm wondering whether there is a place on AskDifferent to post helpful links for Apple-releated topics (e.g. I stumpled across https://hey-siri.io/https://hey-siri.io/ recently which lists possibly everything Siri can do for you). Is there a way to post these without breaking the rules?

What is the proper way to handle posts and questions having to do with beta- or developer- only released iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS questions? Answer them? Ignore them? Vote them down? Inform the person they might be violating their NDA and leave it at that?

I saw https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2707/what-happened-to-the-beta-banthis question (and lots of good info) from January 2016, and https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/573/update-to-faq-regarding-beta-and-pre-release-softwarethis update to the FAQ in 2011. These seem to indicate that the posts are allowed, but do not address how other users are expected to respond. 

Developers and beta testers are (probably) violating their Non-Disclosure Agreement with Apple by discussing it. My NDA also says I can't post screen shots online of any pre-release firmware, which, in addition to not being able to talk about it, makes walking anyone through a fix really difficult. I've made a judgement call that I won't answer questions having to do with these types of posts. Is it up to each of us to make that call?

I found it interesting that http://www.imore.com/apple-pulls-ifixits-app-ios-store-after-it-published-new-apple-tv-teardownApple revoked iFixit's iOS app after they took apart an Apple TV and Siri Remote and documented it online. I wondered if StackExchange was worried about having their app pulled because it allowed (if it IS allowed, that is) users to discuss NDA-violating content.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Developer and Beta-Tester NDAs and Requests for Help on SEb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5iFixit had their app pulled as part of their developer account being canceled for tearing apart a _developer unit_ they were sent by Apple and then went so far as to post details of unreleased hardware online. As StackExchange doesn't (to my knowledge) either receive hardware from Apple, subsequently destroy that hardware, or post details of said unreleased hardware online, the two situations are hardly analogous.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a lot here - I've linked to the best answers on the main meta (for all sites) as well as Stack Overflow (which has dealt with Apple NDA / Beta since before this site was stood up). Our meta has a lot of old posts from when NDA or beta was a guaranteed black flag - where now it's evolved to place most of the trust in the people that decide to enter into an NDA to do the right thing.


















Anything covered by an NDA is off-topic and you can flag it to be closed. https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/573/update-to-faq-regarding-beta-and-pre-release-softwareThe FAQ update you pointed out very clearly says NDA-covered topics are still off topic here as they'd obviously violate the NDAs and we're not looking to be a place where that's encouraged or welcome.

Note though that being a developer beta doesn't mean it's under NDA. Apple's beta program has, in recent times, gotten far more inclusive of the general public which is why we added that FAQ change. So make sure it's really NDA-covered before you flag it. We don't do a lot of post-flag checking (and can't because it'd be too arduous on the handful of moderators we have here).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be clear, the developer beta program and public beta program are still separate entities, though build releases have gotten closer together in recent times. Developer betas are still under NDA as far as I'm aware.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tubedogg absolutely. The closeness of the release trains now is why it's important to check. NDA coverage may have lapsed and a developer beta member, who's under NDA, may not realize this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a developer you might be under NDA whilst a public beta tester might not be. So read the NDA you agreed and as a legal document ask a lawyerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Anything covered by an NDA is off-topic and you can flag it to be closed` that seems like a bad policy for an SE site to enforce, given that SE and its moderators are not party to the agreement. This kind of thing is not done on SO proper, for example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are public betas under NDA? I'm pretty sure that they technically are, but I've seen a lot of people asking for help running the public beta OS, and since it's easy to sign up and download, how important is it to report/close these questions?


















iPhones have a dedicated Voice Memos app. iPads don't, despite running the same OS and also featuring a built-in microphone. 

As an addendum to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/250654/voice-memos-on-the-ipadthis question (which was suggested I move to Meta as per this site's policy), I am super curious what the logic for not making Voice Memos available on the iPad could have been. I was baffled me when I realized it's not available for iPad given that Apple devices are usually designed to work out of the box for a broad range of possible use cases. So Apple must have had a very specific reason for not including it on the iPad. 

So if there's anyone who would be able to help me understand what that reason could have been that would be much appreciated! 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No Voice Memos on the iPad?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand you were encouraged to post this question here by another user, however this is incorrect. See [my comment](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/250654/voice-memos-on-the-ipad#comment311395_250654) on your question.

I would hit up the chat rooms to ask people _why_ they feel Apple does this. Sometimes questions that aren't great for the site make for great discussion pieces.

We might need some discussion about what exactly should be shown in the box then: just icon/title or more?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's really up to what the developer wants to code from what they can scrape.

I know we shouldn't close as "Why don't you Google it yourself?" but we can't even link these as dupes, because they're all subtly different.  

The only similarity they really share is a total lack of effort.

Today's I voted to close as "Customer Support".

Opinions - do we just keep on posting excerpts & links to Everymac [as I see has been done with this one even as I'm typing this question] or do we ask them to do the minimum of research first?

  Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your

I suppose my background for this question is along the lines of :-  


How do we keep newbies?  
How do we train them?

I'm not sure if this community is bored with it. But if it is, then here is what we do at Travel SE. A similar approach may be useful for Ask Different:

There are these questions which can be asked with X and/or Y and there are hundreds if not thousands of variations of X and/or Y.

Often, they are extremely easy to solve, not worthy of having to post them on SE.

So instead of saying "I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because google it yourself you lazy/unintelligent slob." we have canonical questions on how to solve the problem very easily, and then we mark them as duplicates of that.

Some examples

Lots of people ask "What is the weather typically like in location X at time Y?" We mark those as duplicates of "https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/64136/41775How can I find out what the weather is like in a given location on a certain month?" If we didn't there would be hundreds of questions about what the weather would be like, which is extremely easy to look up.

Lots of people ask "I'm going from country X to country Y, how should I bring money?" We close these as duplicates of: https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/10/41775"When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?"

Finally, one day a guy asked "I want to travel to this place pictured in one of the Windows 10 wallpapers, where is it?" The question hit the Hot Network Questions, and https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/238420/321647a lot of rep was earned from it. Then a bunch of such questions started appearing, all about one of the (many) wallpapers from Windows 10. Turns out it's not very hard to find out where each of the wallpapers from Windows 10 are from. So we created the question: "https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/74404/41775Is there a website listing the location of all the Windows 10 lock screens?" So now, we close all such questions as duplicates of that.

There might be a dozen or more types of questions where we have taken a similar approach, but I'm not gonna list them all here. You get the idea. Ask Different may be able to incorporate something similar to this. I'm not saying you should, as I'm not very active here and don't feel I should have a strong opinion in the matter. I'm just offering this approach from Travel SE as a potential suggestion for how to deal with it.

That way it's easy for people to remember / find them by searching for a dupe. Then we can close as dupe knowing that if the asker has an edit, it will be much clearer for them on how to make their question different than the covered ground.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I'm happy to hear that some people here find this approach useful. I'm happy that I shared it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For clarification, because these 'resolution'-type questions keep coming up, are we supposed to submit canonical question/answers here for consideration?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbara It should probably be discussed on meta first,  yeah. (Probably as a separate post per canonical question.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Should we open a new question for which topics would make good use of canonical answers?  I like this idea, I'm just not sure how to proceed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbara If you have a particular topic in mind, maybe just go ahead and ask a new meta question about it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is definitely needed.

"Somebody treated me such-and-such, what should I do" is practically always off-topic. OTOH, the linked question can be turned into a "what options do I have if this-and-this fails" question with a small edit which is on-topic usually.

I hope that was the correct thing to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I liked your answer :-)


















I'm in favor of keeping as simple and as close to the current wording as possible.


  "Basic Customer Support or questions asking to recommend or find off-site resources (Mac/book/software/tutorial) are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/Software/https://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/Hardware recommendations can be asked at their own dedicated sites.  Alternatively, edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it."

So sending every software enquiry to softwarerecs would be a policy change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hardware may be different, but there the typical "is a Mac xyz enought to do abc" is probably off-topic on both sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't remember the last time I saw a request for a recommendation that was written as well as that link suggests :-).  I'm ok with that policy but it still leaves us reviewers with a little confusion regarding how to handle those questions. For poorly-written questions, I think updating the close statement to include the SR site would be helpful to the OP.  For well-written ones, answering them here appears to be ok.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For poorly-written questions we can refer them to the meta post to show them how to improve the question. The guidelines on SR are similar to the meta post here, so just sending them off without guidance will lead to yet another frustration once they posted over there (something I would like to avoid).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So I understand better, when you say 'refer them to the meta post' do you mean update the close answer or just add a comment pointing to the meta answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Update the close reasonb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, @patrix, I think that's a good approach.  This is my first time thru this process so what do we do next?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you update your answer (or post a second one)? I'll ping the other mods to join the discussion)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've added it as a new answer.


















I've added a new answer to keep track of the revisions.  Based on the discussion comments, here's an updated close answer.  I added the last sentence to make sure we're clear in our direction (and avoid frustration on both sides of the question).  


  "Basic Customer Support or questions asking to recommend or find off-site resources (Mac/book/software/tutorial) are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam.

It's an automated Stack Exchange message asking you to help with Stack Overflow in Russian. These messages are usually sent for events such as a moderator election being held on a site that you have an account on. Receiving a message for a site you don't have an account on seems like a bug, unless this is a special message I'm not aware of.

I seem to recall receiving a similar message about a different site a very long time ago, but perhaps I'm misremembering. Unfortunately these kinds of messages don't appear in the inbox API endpoint, so I can't search my inbox history.

By the way, running the message https://translate.google.co.uk/#ru/en/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%0AStack%20Overflow%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%20%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D1%8F%20%D0%B2%20%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%B9%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B8!through Google Translate gives me the following:

Actually no moderator commented on the second question you've linked. The comments have been created automatically based on the actions the reviewers selected for the question in the review queue. 

What I intended to explain to you (but maybe didn't do so well) is that there is no need to tell people that a post has been flagged. Comments on how a post can be improved or why a post doesn't fit to the guidelines are welcome. One of the exceptions here are comments recommending people to ask their questions on another SE site, because this may lead to people posting the same question twice (instead of one of the mods moving it to the other site). In such cases just flagging them for mod attention (or proposing a close) is usually the better option
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for responding, @patrix.  So the comments made by klanomath and grgarside are the result of the flagging **only** and not them flagging *and* commenting (which the wording makes it appear)?  I guess that's the source of my confusion, these comments don't appear when I flag a question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5High rep users can not only flag questions but also directly propose/vote for close. In the latter case, the close reason they pick may result in a comment created automatically.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I want to be consistent with the rest of the site.  I see value in letting the OP know, as soon as possible, the reason for the flag (because it can take hours for the question to close and the close-reason to appear).  I'm ok if you guys don't think that's a good way to proceed so I won't add those comments anymore.  Thanks for clearing that up for me!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Usually there is no hurry, also what does it help if the user knows that a flag has been raised (which a mod may later decline)? It is preferable to use comments to point out things which are missing or ways a post can be improved.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point, I didn't think of that.  Thx again.


















There's no directive - we are free to form consensus and self-edit the FAQ.

I was very against closing hacintosh questions when I started in the Ask Different community (and started here as opposed to another site then coming here). The guidelines aren't 100% followed and there is always wiggle room to raise a specific closure or non-closure on meta.

The post you mentioned is one of many and I must say - the vast majority of questions closed under "hacintosh" would also be closed as too broad, unclear, 

I would say - what we need is some few people to champion these types of questions - clean up any marginal ones. Ask and answer detailed ones. If there is a steady set of useful, detailed, well received posts - that would make it easy to post to meta a request to relax the wording of the FAQ.


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1722/should-the-help-page-remove-the-prohibition-on-hackintoshShould the help page remove the prohibition on hackintosh? (or maybe just a lot more votes on the answer saying yes)


Here in late 2016 - my personal feeling is that we aren't closing useful questions due to that part of the site scope, but I'd be happy to revisit my opinion by looking at specific counter examples to the generalization I made above about questions relating to loading / troubleshooting OS X on non apple hardware being low quality in general.

If someone were to lead with some awesome questions - I'd support reopening them to see how they are received. Please raise a meta question if you spot this close reason being used for something you feel is a good question in all other respects. I'll be glad to help guide these posts or facilitate discussions between people closing since it's "in the rules" as opposes to closing since it's not useful.

Since it seems the community wants to remove it, and there's no directive from SE, then why not do it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Fiksdal I appreciate your asking. I have featured the question to see if it gets some more votes. At the moment - there's not even one answer that's +10 so it seems like people are apathetic in general for making this change. See my comment on when I'd get involved in agitating for change. Can you help raise awareness and/or ask some questions that are awesome on the main site while we think over changing the official stance?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for featuring the question :) Well l, don't have any questions about my Hackintosh at the moment, but I'll post if I think of any :)


















I tend to agree with https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1747/88313this answer by @daviesgeek and https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1743/88313this answer by @jaume (minus the legality argument).  Both make, what I consider, valid points about the types of questions that will be asked if hackintosh questions are allowed. 

At a very simplistic level, I see this as breaking down to 2 main points: 


Almost every hackintosh question will be very specific and very unique to the individual questioner.  
It will ultimately devolve into "will this configuration work...?" or "how do I build...?" questions and there are already good sites for that.
EDIT (10/23/16): In support of my point above, https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/258375/88313here's a perfect example of the types of questions that, I believe, we'll be flooded with if the prohibition is lifted.


The first sentence of https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask here? really boils down why this SE site exists: "Ask Different is for users of Apple products."  A hackintosh is not an Apple product (before you argue with me on the semantics of "what is an Apple product?", the most basic answer is "products made by Apple").

Right now, I really like this site because every question & answer I see can apply to hundreds or thousands of other people.  They can have the same hardware/software/version and the application of the answer(s) have broad appeal.  Once we start accepting very limited, almost singularly-focused, questions, we lose the broad-base.  Sure, it will help the person asking the question but the odds are very high that it will only help that person and none other.  If that's where we, the community, and SE, the owners, want to focus our efforts then that's ok; we just need to be aware of the potential downside to doing that.

Regarding my point #2, almost every hackintosh question I've seen in my time here has had some part of this mix-and-match type of question.  There could be 1, 10, or a 100 reasons why the OPs particular mix of parts will not work and that could lead us down the a road for days before we realize that where we are has nothing to do with the lone Apple OS they're using.  Once again, while it might help that one OP that one time, it's probably not going to help others at any time (I said 'probably' so please don't accuse me of saying 'never').  

I think where the mods and community are now has taken is a very good place and it helps more people in its current state that it will if changed for this, specific reason.

Re: BMike's question - https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2418/where-is-the-list-of-canonical-questions-stored-for-ask-differentWhere is the list of canonical questions stored for Ask Different?

It would seem reasonable that such questions could get their own tag type.

Trying to find them when closing as a dupe is not all that simple. Even when you know the keywords for the dupe search field - for example, I just tested "bypass activation lock" & it turned up 9th in the list. If you're less certain of the title it involves digging through meta to find BMike's QA first.

I even tried "[ios] bypass"... but it's not tagged iOS, it's iPhone.

If we had a [canonical] or [faq] tag type, it would make things a lot simpler, imo.  

Opinions?

I wonder if some of the other SE sites that have canonical flags have problems with people over-using them?  If not, then this is a non-issue.


















Absolutely no.

This proposal is literally opposing the purpose of tagging: categorising the content of questions. Tags should be about the question content, as defined in the first line of the relevant section of the help center. Meta-tags are also specifically mentioned as later on in the article.


  A tag is a word or phrase that describes the topic of the question.





  Avoid meta-tags
  Do not use meta-tags in questions. Here are some tips to help you determine whether a tag is a meta-tag:
  …


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/tagginghttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/tagging

Your proposed tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/canonicalcanonical says nothing about the content of the question. Meta-tagging has been prohibited from Stack Exchange sites for many years now.


  meta-tagging is explicitly discouraged





  If the tag can't work as the only tag on a question, it's probably a meta-tag.

We have no mechanism [other than maintaining our own personal reference lists] for quickly searching a canonical post to vote on a dupe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tetsujin The blog post was to illustrate the background behind the decision — the help center is current and shows the same view. Maintaining a reference list is the same as maintaining a list of questions with a specific tag, except the latter is meta-tagging and shouldn't be used.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Shouldn't" is what the community decides, not what legacy dictates. Maintaining a reference list, personal to each user or buried away on a meta-post, is not really the way to be able to recall a canonical database for commonly re-asked questions. Anyway, I've said my piece, I won't vote on this answer either way, I'll see what the community decides on patrick's yes/no vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tetsujin I definitely agree with the first statement, but it was the community that decided that meta-tagging was inappropriate. I'm agreeing with them not just because of the legacy but because I agree with the sentiment and the problems caused by the use of meta-tagging. Cheers for this meta discussion by the way!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then maybe we don't use "canonical" for a tag but we do something similar to [this practice](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/q/2498) at the Math SE site?  While they refer to these as 'meta tags', they seem like a step-up from a specific tag and a step-down from an overly generic "canonical" tag.  idk, I like the "canonical" tag but definitely see @grgarside's point, too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: the math meta - these/this tag would never be stand-alone. It would be applied retrospectively. Ideally no-one would 'claim' it on a first answer to a new question, it would be added after some time, as a retroactive action on multi-posts on very similar issues. If it were possible, I'd prefer it to be an admin-only tag, to aid only this one problem, not randomly added to posts by idio... errmmm... users who want to claim a 'rank' [but I doubt that's possible, so some policing/discussion would be required.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside - I do agree with your sentiments overall, meta-tagging is not a "good thing". I'm seeing this as a 'quick search' for really 'special' answers that have the community behind them as 'good fit for many situations' QAsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree meta tags are generally bad, but there's always an exception. Consider the FAQ and featured tag in meta. That's a double dose of meta, but having one exception might be worth exploring. I need to think over your good points - imaginary +1 for putting them down in writing.


















The tag wiki is also missing the June 2012 Mac Pro. In my opinion, it's just an outdated tag wiki and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mac-promac-pro should be used for every Mac Pro including the June 2012 and 2013 models not mentioned on the tag wiki.

I don't think a separate tag is really necessary to distinguish between the legacy Mac Pro models and the current design, but I'm also not against the idea. However, I would prefer tagging questions regarding the legacy design with a renamed tag such as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mac-pro-legacymac-pro-legacy and the current Mac Pro being tagged with https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mac-promac-pro, since I don't think we should be using anything but the product title for current products.

Side note: Hardware tags are misused as it is — briefly checking the first couple of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mac-promac-pro questions yields things such as "How to make Siri available when I open my MacBook?

I *do think* moving the old Mac Pro to a new tag is a good idea; because when *properly* used to tag hardware-specific / hardware-related questions, they're pretty substantially different machines - but it's really not a priority thing, because you're right, they look widely mis-used. /=b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5George raises a great point about the tags being deployed very poorly and inefficiently. If we were to do an audit of 25 random questions tagged with a specific tag and most are wrongly used - merging the bad tags to a larger bin might help people know what or when to use them.


















I personally think that since this is not legal in the sense that apple does not condone nor support this behavior, I'd say delete all questions from the site having to do with the hackentosh.

Apple doesn't condone jailbreaking either, should all jailbreaking questions be deleted from Ask Different too?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That might be true, however apple has specifically stated if you do this you are invalidating (if that is even a word)  the TOS and license agreements therein. So yeah I say again, remove those threads. I'm not trying to start anything, but I am saying this as it is not legal, and people on other lists I'm on have gotten band for posting such informationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you want to jailbreaking threads also?


















These questions get rather tiresome after a while...

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/261859/is-it-possible-to-connect-the-new-dell-31-5-inch-monitor-up3216q-at-3840x2160Is it possible to connect the new DELL 31.5-inch monitor (UP3216Q) at 3840x2160 to the new macbook pro (late 2016)?

The chances of someone else on Ask Different having exactly the same setup with a brand new Mac & monitor are so remote as to be infinitesimal.  

EveryMac, the usual go-to for these questions, doesn't cover every single possible plug & socket on every possible Mac/monitor configuration. It just gives maximum resolutions.

We're left with, "Why don't you ask Dell?"

I'm tempted to start closing them as Basic Customer Support.

Any opinions either way?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why don't you ask Dell?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we find a canonical answer to use for these types of questions?  I thought one such answer was already pointed out on a different Meta question, so I'll go look for that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb not really we can give a question saying will a monitor supporting Displayport 1.2 work - but in this case the questioner does not know that this matters so really it is ask Dell or give an answer for every different monitorb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5“The chances of someone else on Ask Different having exactly the same setup with a brand new Mac & monitor are so remote as to be infinitesimal.” — *[citation needed]* Surely those chances increase with time, as more people buy that Mac and that monitor.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with this. A monitor that supports certain input format and a macbook that supports certain output format can be matched together if these two are known. I would be fairly confident with answering the above question in the affirmative, because recent macbook pros can drive 4K dell monitors. I have done it on many occasions with a wide range of different monitors. You don't need the exact setup to answer this question. Hardware is designed to work to standards. All hardware manufacturers need to use standards to ensure their stuff is compatibleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yeah, I mean, just wait until someone happens along with the right set-up... great way to get some points if you are trying to become a helpful poster.


















Each December, the developers run a game / enhancement / treasure hunt that involves hats on avatars.


http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.comhttp://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com


The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. The above site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. 

Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage. 

The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.

If anyone has a reason why we should hate hats as a site as opposed to individuals, an answer here is a great place to make that case.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the site opt out of Winter Bash 2016?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the hats ⭅:)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for the question - nicely balanced... but you know the answer - **Nuuuu... we love hats!!** ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't figure out who would down-vote this question... It basically asks a simple yes/no question as a community, with a solo opt-out clause. What could possibly deserve a down-vote? If you want or don't want hats, vote on one or more of the answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't worry too much @Tetsujin - on meta people down vote things they don't want to see enacted. So a down vote here = an up vote for the no answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hokay - fair enough. I guess it just seems simpler to vote on the yes/no answers to me ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I'm reading the "I Am Your Father" hat correctly, then answering or voting on this question that you don't want hats is worth... a hat.

Now it is neither! As of June 13, 2016, the name has been changed to macOS https://www.apple.com/macos/sierra/https://www.apple.com/macos/sierra/

During the keynote at WWDC on June 13, 2016, Apple announced that OS X would be renamed macOS to stylistically match Apple's other operating systems, such as iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

Why should we opt out Winter Bash? Its always a fun game. Even developers need a little fun some times.

I Love Hats.

In the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here? page it clearly states that:


  Ask Different is for users of Apple products. If you have a
  question about ...
  
  
  Apple hardware
  Apple software
  Apple services including iTunes Connect (selling music, books, apps)
  third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products.
  
  
  ... then you're in the right place to ask your question!


Recently https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5472/bmikebmike corrected me because I had assumed a question about a formula in Excel was off-topic. I accepted his correction (obviously, as a moderator with the highest reputation I wasn't going to think he was wrong!), but since then I've seen a number of instances where users have voted to close questions as off-topic because the questions were about third-party software.

This got me to thinking that perhaps the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here? page could do with some minor revision. It may be something as simple as a formatting change to bold the words "third-party hardware, services and software" in the last bullet point.

What do others think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is a revision required to the "What topics can I ask about here?" page in the Help Center?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whiuch questions were closed - I would also not the off topic condition - Basic Customer Support - so can be a matter of opinion which of the two criteria apply.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure the questions were actually closed, just that there were people voting for them to be closed. But I do agree that it often comes down to a matter of opinion in terms of what category applies.


















I'm using Firefox 50.0.2 and noticed the layout in my profile on this site is broken. Something is wrapping or overflowing unexpectedly and it's throwing the whole section off:

Well, somebody using Excel on macOS is a user of an Apple product, and the bullet list makes it rather clear what a question can be about. I partially understand your confusion, but IMHO the wording is rather clear.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree the wording **is** clear, but in the past week I've seen a few questions users have voted to close on the basis they were off-topic when, based on the last bullet point, they aren't. I think the last bullet point is a little lost, not only because it's the last one, but because the first three start with the word _Apple_ which stands out because it's 'Apple' and because of the capital 'A'. Also, the stem sentence has _users of Apple products_ in **bold**. I guess others will learn that these questions are on-topic, but I just thought a minor formatting change may reduce confusion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, but then we would kind of need all bullets in bold, somehow.


















Just for some balance on the voting [& not a reflection of my personal opinion] let's see how much activity this one can generate.

I've edited the post to make it look less like a subtle advert for wondershare and moved it to comments. That's not a normal thing, but you have a reasonable comment and it might help the site get a better answer to the question you linked.

I was googling how to find the location of backups on iTunes and how to change their locations, but the answers are around 3 years old. What is the right approach to getting these updated. 

I could add a comment, but I believe that goes to the person who asked the question or answered the questions, but would it make the question visible again?

Questions that made me think of this, there is always the possibility I have not looked far enough through the question, but I think the question remains the same.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/96623/where-on-my-pc-does-itunes-store-the-backupWhere on my pc does iTunes store the backup?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we get a question updated for a new version?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With regard to those two specific questions, in my opinion they are not outdated and the answers are still current?


















The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/set-bountiesbounty system can draw attention to an outdated Q&A. This allows you to promote the question on the site such that someone may be able to provide a more up-to-date answer or edit an existing answer. There is a specific bounty reason for this:


  Current answers are outdated
  The current answer(s) are out-of-date and require revision given recent changes.


You can also ask another question, making sure to link to the previous question and specify how it does not answer your question due to changes. This may lead to the older question being edited to be clear that it is specific to an older version.

For example, a question regarding how to do a certain task ‘on an iPhone’ may be outdated due to an updated version of iOS. By asking a separate question about how to do the task ‘in iOS 10’, the older question can be edited to be specific to how the task is performed ‘on iOS 9’ or such.

For example, today I saw in the Close Votes queue [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/261659/macos-sierra-keeps-running-out-of-application-memory). I assume the duplicate questions are [this one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/255993/os-x-el-capitan-installer-app-has-crippled-my-mac-mini) and [this one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129435/after-downloading-file-installer-process-runs-and-uses-all-memory).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My gut instinct is to keep the question open (it's about Sierra) as one of the others specifies El Capitan, while the other one specifies file installers and may not be found by someone trying to find an answer. But is my gut instinct right, or should we edit one (or both) of the other questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth I voted to leave that open since whilst it is 'Installer' causing the problem it's not the *actual* macOS Installer.app unlike those other two you linked to. I think many didn't notice this given what people have responded with. Both are completely separate questions and shouldn't be marked as duplicate, regardless of OS version. (Also I've been waiting for you to join chat to say this but I wanted to personally thank you for all your contributions to Ask Different and I look forward to your participation in the future; you should absolutely not view yourself as a new user!)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your feedback. I also voted to keep that one open, so I'm glad my thinking was okay on that.

I am new here and am a little confused. Why are you allowed to down vote an answer without leaving a comment? That provides me with no information as to how to improve my answer. 

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/266556/is-this-safe-place-to-download/266559#266559Is this safe to download and use Gutenprint driver for Mac from their site?

Any help is appreciated.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my answer down voted, and most importantly why did it not require the user to leave a comment?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't and wouldn't downvote your answer, but I could see someone objecting because it makes a rather blanket statement. Basically, you wrote, 'if you want to know if it's safe, ask VirusTotal'; this implies that VirusTotal is 100% accurate, which we know to be impossible in practice. I might have worded it a little differently, such as "if they say it's safe, it's probably safe"


















The down vote process asks people to consider leaving constructive criticism, but it isn't required. Sometimes there's nothing significant about a vote other than someone, somehwere on the internet didn't like the post. 

or a cat is operating someone's browser and can't figure out how to take the down vote back:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxx2G.jpg

Other times, there's an obvious link to:

A) not enough research shown
B) not enough specificity
C) several questions being asked
D) just not a useful question in one person's eyes

I don't think your answer is nearly as bad as the question. Maybe people felt virus total is spammy?

You can discuss a lot of things that are illegal without falling afoul of the law. Imagine if you couldn't discuss murder? It'd be really hard to study case law or report the news.

There's also varying laws around the world when it comes to actions. So some action that might be illegal in one country could be perfectly legal in another.

Knowledge isn't illegal to possess or to share.

I don't know if this is an appropriate question to ask here, but I thought this would be the best place to ask. I have noticed (especially recently) a LOT of spam questions (true spam, like for body-building products or magic ED fixes). I noticed three within the span of a few hours the other day and just flagged another one now. I feel like this site gets more than it should and more than the other site I'm on (Photography).

So, my questions are:


Am I completely wrong in my assumption that there is way too much spam, or have others noticed it too?
Is there anything that can be done to prevent spam questions like these from ever being posted?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why does Ask Different receive so much spam posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might want to look at [Charcoal HQ's statistics](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/graphs?timeframe=all) -- briefly, Drupal is the site in the Stack Exchange network which receives the most spam in relation to its user base, but Apple.SE is probably in the top 5 (8th position by absolute numbers). For a start, you might want to check out the [chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq) and see if you can find a way to contribute.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Only site admins are in a position to prevent spam from being posted in the first place.  They have some IP-range blocks in place, for example, though the details are not well documented, for obvious reasons.  Maybe ask over at https://meta.stackexchange.com instead as this is in no way specific to this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The tools mentioned in the answers do a good job in flagging/deleting spam posts within minutes. If you want to help just flag such posts as spam and move on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to complain more: Seriously? Three in less than 15 minutes???

https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXIzt.png


















I really wish there was a one-vote ban-hammer on these - maybe like the gold badge one-vote close.

Maybe you could gain a spam-hammer badge after successfully flagging 100 with no false positives, or an ability added to users over x rep [perhaps with a review queue after the fact, to make sure it's not being mis-used]
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=deleted%3a1%20locked%3a1%20migrated%3ano%20is%3aquestion%20answers%3a0, it usually only takes a few minutes before spam questions are downvoted into oblivion. If anything I would prefer a "delete as spam and destroy user immediately" button :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix That search isn't going to work for non-mods.


















The most powerful tool we have for immediate use is for everyone to flag as spam on those posts. That ensures the best improvement on the tools to detect and suppress spam. 

You are right. The past month here has more spam than possibly 10 months before. We the elected moderators sincerely thank you all for flagging these ham fisted spam posts so we can get them deleted from view. 

Here is a search that lets moderators search for the posts fitting his pattern - https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=deleted%3a1%20locked%3a1%20migrated%3ano_https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=deleted%3a1%20locked%3a1%20migrated%3ano

10k users can see deleted posts - once they get the link. Currently, 10k users can only search for their deleted posts - not anyone's posts.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, they get flagged & deleted fairly quickly; I just wish we go go **Boom!! ByeBye** with a single-click ;) btw, search looks similar to Patrix's below - looks like mods-only.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The `deleted:1` search option works differently for non-mod 10K users - they see [only _their own_ deleted posts](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/270562). So unless 10K users are spammers themselves, they won't get anything.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zaq Thanks - I better edit that out if no one useful can benefit. We already have shared that link amongst the moderation team. We're aware of the pain and share in the wish to have a perfect filter. Alas - turning up the screws on the algorithm has a need to have someone to clear false positives. It's an arms race between the algorithm to block spam and the spammers. For a good long time, the algorithm has won decisively on our site.


















I disagree with creating a canonical question for this. With each one of those cases, whilst ‘restore from backup’ is a suitable answer, there are other answers which apply to specific cases. For example, adjusting Boot Camp partition from Windows has many answers beside restoring from a backup, but those answers wouldn't apply to the other cases. Canonical answers are great, but make sure they only canonicalise those questions which are identical.

I asked https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/268215/this question on Ask Different:


  I'm looking for one of these types of stylish MacBook keyboard skins [see image in original], but I don't want any of the keys marked. I just want blank keys, without letters/symbols. Do any such products exist?


In my opinion, this question is not at all related to customer support (it's directly related to Apple hardware) and it's not opinion-based (it's not as if I'm asking for the prettiest keyboard skin), yet it's on hold for being a basic customer support question.  Yet now it's on hold:


  Basic Customer Support or questions asking to recommend or find off-site resources (Mac/book/software/tutorial) are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it.




I feel like both my problem and research done so far are clearly described, and I know this question isn't going to generate opinionated answers; how can a "this product exists, here is proof" answer be opinionated?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is a specific, non-customer support question on hold as basic customer support?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Though I didn't vote to close it, I think it's closed because it's a product recommendation request, which can generate innumerable correct answers if multiple products exist. That's why this site is better suited to specific questions about Apple Hardware like "My iPhone is in a boot loop, what do I do?" rather than "Which case should I get for x need" (which can have multiple answers that are corrected based on opinion rather than based on whether they actually solve the problem of your boot loop.


















The close reason used here has two parts. For your question the second part 


  [...] or questions asking to recommend or find off-site resources (Mac/book/software/tutorial) are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam


is more applicable than the customer support part. Based on experience from similar questions in the past, such questions will attract opinionated (aka non-fact based) answers (and potentially spam) and, in the end, most of the answers will just be links to product web sites (making the answers look like the result of a Google search).

AskDifferent (as any other SE site) works best for questions which have clear, fact-based answers. It doesn't work so well for questions where a lot of answers are possible without a clear way to determine their individual merit.

You could also try to add details about research done etc so it doesn't look like something one could easily ask Google or Amazon. But it might be difficult even then.


















I want to give answers to some questions that I know the answer to, but I don't know how to express my answer. What should I keep in mind when I answer any questions?

Should the tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/terminalterminal be renamed to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/terminal.appterminal.app? I think this would help make it clear that the tag should only be used on questions regarding the macOS Terminal.app.

General command line questions not specific to the Terminal app should use https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/command-linecommand-line, as mentioned in the tag wiki excerpt for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/terminalterminal:


  questions narrowly about terminal.app alone should use this tag. Please consider using **command-line** for any question not specifically about the native terminal app


However it is still misused heavily. Other macOS app tags have the ‘.app’ extension, however this one doesn't.

Can the tag be renamed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename [terminal] to [terminal.app] to make it clear the tag is for the macOS appb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It won't make a difference people don't seem to read tag wikis - they use the terminal so terminal to do the command so the tag  must be terminalb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark That hasn't really been true for [photos] vs [photos.app] and other such cases. It's just in this case the tag for Terminal is the style of the former rather than the latter. Even if it doesn't help which I doubt, the tag still doesn't fit with the rest of the tags on the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I could make a synonym for this. Seems reasonable and it's easy to reverse or undo if we decide it didn't help or hurts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pointing *to* [terminal] doesn't help though? No-one's trying [terminal.app] — the problem is people are using [terminal]. My suggestion to show [terminal.app] would help indicate that's not what they're after, but with the synonym you set up pointing *to* [terminal], that's the wrong direction?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok. Then let's wait for more consensus. I don't think having command-line and terminal and terminal.app is a good change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Neither do I; I'm suggesting only [command-line] and [terminal.app], just to be clear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's clear up this [terminal] confusion.


















I agree with this proposal. 'Terminal.app' makes it clear that it is the app and no the general subject of command line or terminal questions. A synonym defeats this, but renaming the tag should work. 

'Command-line' for command line issues, and 'terminal.app' for the program. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree in theory with this. In practice, we would need a team to start editing all the terminal questions to retag them with command-line. Once that effort is 25% of the way done (say 1 thousand of the 3.7k posts tagged with terminal), we might be OK making the change to the tag summaries? Or we could make terminal.app and have three tags temporarily. Still process the 3.7 k posts to add terminal.app only where needed and then merge?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike My initial plan (if this was to go ahead) was to rename [terminal] to [terminal.app] without any need for retagging initially. The tag is misused at the moment, but renaming the tag to something more appropriate won't cause any additional harm in the cases where it's misused currently (it's wrong at the moment, renaming wouldn't make it any more wrong). Then, as part of cleanup, slowly go through the [terminal.app] questions and retag to [command-line] as appropriate. What change to tag summaries are you suggesting? I don't think having three tags is the way to go, even temporarily?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike All things considered I am in favour of this proposal. However, I do feel that a cleanup should happen as soon as possible, otherwise we risk creating a bad user experience for some users. FWIW I'd be happy to be a part of any team to edit/retag the questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I'm just wondering whatever happened with this? If nothing, how do we know when a _consensus_ has been reached (one way or the other)? Just asking because I'm happy to help edit/retag questions if necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does SE have functionality for "depreciating" tags? We could let current questions retain the "terminal" tag but bar new questions from using it, so that everyone is forced to use either "command line" or "terminal.app" going forward.


















On Ask Different especially, a significant proportion of questions are asked by unregistered users who are then unable to accept an answer to their question as correct. This is a massive disincentive to answering questions from unregistered users, given that the probability of reputation gain from that answer is significantly lower.

I have https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/242711/can-someone-who-registered-my-iphone-read-all-my-text-messages/242715#242715one such answer that has been left un-accepted despite receiving 35 upvotes (and 0 downvotes) because the OP is unregistered and thus has no means of accepting it. 

Could there be a way to automatically accept answers to unregistered users' questions once they reach, say, +5 votes? This rule would remove the disincentive of answering many of Ask Different's questions, and get users well-earned reputation points.

I have been seeing a lot of questions like: "I want to install El Capitan, but I never got it from the App Store. How can I do this?"

The best option for this is "Get a friend with the installer." I have installers going back to Mavericks. Would it be useful and legal for me to create a Google Drive account where I could post these installers? The idea would be that I could create a canonical question/answer so that each time a question like this comes up, we can mark it as a duplicate of the question with a link to all of the installers.

I also understand that people have a hard time getting their hands on these installers. I'm trying to provide easy access to these installers without sacrificing security. Can you think of any good ways to do this? Also, is the fact that the app is signed by Apple (and its checksum returns ok) an ok indicator that it hasn't been tampered with?

I've recently created the little snitch tag and I observed that it has been made synonym with firewall. Probably to be consistent with the already existing synonym relationship between pf and firewall. https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=little-snitch+is%3AquestionSearching for little-snitch is:question returns 117 results. Some of these results are questions about little snitch such as :


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/54872/little-snitch-and-different-network-profilesLittle snitch and different network profiles


and some other questions are not directly about Little Snitch but mention it in the question such as :


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63540/what-is-gs-loc-apple-comWhat is gs-loc.apple.com?


I think it would be nice to have a Little Snitch tag in order to regroup all questions directly about Little Snitch. The same reasoning can be done about pf.

Now both the Little Snitch tag and the pf tag are synonyms to the firewall tag. I think this situation is not ideal because:

1) pf and Little Snitch are not really synonyms of firewall but rather "instance of" firewall. 

2) Little Snitch is an application firewall and has a different usage than firewalls such as pf.

3) better precision could be gained by having stand alone tags for pf and Little Snitch.

I propose to remove the synonym relationship between Little Snitch and firewall and between pf and firewall and let the tags Little Snitch and pf be stand-alone tags.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should [pf] and [little-snitch] be synonyms of [firewall]?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this up on Meta!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't take my answer for the only one, other users may have different opinions :-)


















IMHO having less but broad tags is better than getting too fine granular (because the more granular tags get the bigger the risk that people will use the wrong tag or no tag at all). Also the more tags we have the more effort there is to keep usage in line with the tag description (otherwise having the tag will not be of any use).

In the specific case, questions about "pf" and "Little Snitch" should also have the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firewallfirewall tag anyway, so the synonym kind of ensures that they get categorized correctly even if that part gets forgotten. And if the question really is about something specific to "Little Snitch" it will be mentioned in the question text and can easily be found (as shown in the query used in the question above).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand the argument about granularity but since multi-tagging is supported I'm not sure it applies. I agree with you when you say : 'questions about "pf" and "Little Snitch" should **also** have the firewall tag' but for this the synonym relationship must be removed otherwise "pf" and "Little Snitch" tags are automatically removed. Finally, yes the full text search engine can be used to find "Little Snitch" related questions but the advantage of a tagging system is to explicitly group together related questions without relying on string patterns. Isn't it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The meaning here is that any question concerning "pf" or "Little Snitch" should be tagged [tag:firewall], irregardless of whether they are tagged with [tag:pf] or [tag:little-snitch]. Tag usage on AD isn't very consistant (and hardly anybody edits for tags afterwards), so whatever gets assigned initially usually sticks. If users use [tag:pf] or [tag:little-snitch] *without* also using [tag:firewall] we end up in a situation which is worse than before (because the word "firewall" may very well *not* appear in the question so text search will fail).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In general I consider tags to be supplemental information which *may* help to search for specific things. Having a well-structured tag system in place would require much more maintenance effort than anybody is willing to put into a site like this.


















Let's look at the questions you cited (and thanks for putting specific examples in the question).


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/54872/little-snitch-and-different-network-profilesLittle snitch and different network profiles - This question isn't even getting the correct network / firewall tag. Adding flavors of firewall seem very low hanging fruit when the basic tags that will let people follow things they choose to answer aren't even being used.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63540/what-is-gs-loc-apple-comWhat is gs-loc.apple.com? - this is tagged well and also shows that additional tags of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pfpf or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/little-snitchlittle-snitch would not make any improvement in search-ability that I can see.


Having too many tags is harmful to the site. Until there's a large volume of potential posts and it helps people know how to ask - I'm generally for merging down (with synonyms where it's really needed) as opposed to making tags for specific titles. Keep in mind - we don't have a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/microsoft-wordmicrosoft-word or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/microsoft-excelmicrosoft-excel tag in favor of collecting them under the office umbrella. Please let us know in the comments if there some case where a tag will improve asking or finding questions to answer. I'm open to revisiting the general thinking I've shared here on when to make a synonym or merge vs when to let a tag exist as a stand alone tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags are an improvement in the example I give in my question. It allows to discriminate between questions where Little Snitch is used just as a tool but is not the topic of the question such as in [What is gs-loc.apple.com?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63540/what-is-gs-loc-apple-com) and between questions where Little Snitch is the main topic of the question such as in [Little snitch and different network profiles](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/54872/little-snitch-and-different-network-profiles). This can be generalized to any tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@OrtomalaLokni Can you give examples of specific situations/use cases (from the point of view of a future visitor of the site) where having a [tag:little-snitch] tag would be better than a text search for "Litte Snitch"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix, Yes, if a user interested in the Little Snitch application clicks on the little-snitch tag, he will have the list of all questions directly related to the Little Snitch application without all questions where Little Snitch was just use as a tool to solve another unrelated problem. If a user interested in the Little Snitch application search for the Little Snitch string, he will get a list with related and unrelated question. Adding a Little Snitch tag allows the user to have less noise and better precision.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@OrtomalaLokni Why would a user just be interested in Little Snitch? And if they are, what prevents them from searching for the text instead of the tag? We get a lot of traffic via Google searches (or, in other words, via text searches). And even with the tag: how can we ensure that the tag is applied consistantly?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sometimes you are interested in solving a technical problem but sometimes you are interested to gain knowledge in a particular topic or application. The [SO help center](http://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging) says about tags : "Tags are a means of connecting experts with questions they will be able to answer by sorting questions into specific, well-defined categories. Tags can also be used to help you identify questions that are interesting or relevant to you." You cannot be 100% sure that tags are applied consistently but that's the role of the community.


















For what it's worth, I think you end up losing a lot of potential contributors coming in with potentially valuable input on specific problems they're facing by requiring them to answer other questions just in order to leave a comment.

Potential new contributors are going to come into the site by clicking through google search results describing a problem they're having and finding an SE question along the same lines.  They've likely got an immediately pressing issue they're actively trying to solve. So, the idea that they're going to go answer some other un-related questions ... ?

In my case, I was https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/269483/vim-the-editor-keeps-crashing-on-sierra/270138#comment338830_269483attempting to provide some feedback on a specific issue I was facing, describing some things I'd already tried.  This is a normal part of diagnosing an issue and it's valuable, even if you don't have a final answer.  I couldn't comment, so I left it as an answer.  An initial editor kindly moved it to a comment before deleting it.

However, https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/193213a follow-up comment that I tried to leave (responding to a suggestion in another comment) was summarily deleted.  Again, I couldn't leave it as a comment, so it was left as an answer in the hopes that an editor would again move it to the comment thread.

When one's feedback gets deleted like that, one is not particularly inclined to go try to answer some other questions not related to the issue at hand just to leave one's feedback.

The 50 points threshold may seem hard. But if we did not have it, the comment sections would soon turn into reddit or 9gag. The few valuable comments would be lost in the noise. Requiring that people prove themselves, before allowing them to comment, is the lesser of two evils.

and the second 


  The battery. I thought it was a word in English, my bad 


I have use flag for both with "obsolete". Cause there is not word "accu" anymore there. It was replaced more than 2 years before I have flagged it. 

Aren't this comments obsolete?
Why are the flags declined?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are my comment flags (obsolete) declined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't speak for the person who declined the flags, but there are no strict rules regarding processing of comment flags. And one could probably argue that in the case mentioned above the discussion about the meaning of words was worth keeping even after the OP edited the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix I disagree completely that those comments were worth keeping. The edit was made and saved in the revision history, no need to keep the comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside Comments are, well, comments, and honestly, as long as a comments aren't rude, abusive or spam I think time is better spent at improving answers than at flagging them (or discussing declined comment flags).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix if you (as moderator) think this way - why don't you try to vote for disable flagging comments that are not rude, abusive or spam?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I try to flag sometimes obsolete comments to make the answers more clear for other users to read.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't mind people flagging comments, and I process comment flags as careful as any other flag (or required mod action). And usually flags on one comment below a post are a good reason to cleanup *all* flags on the post (or even in the whole thread). So by all means, if you want to flag comments, do so, it's how the site works.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OTOH time is limited, so if you want to spend 15 minutes a day improving the site it's usually better spent by answering questions and improving existing posts than by flagging comments.


















I believe I declined your flags. In general, comments moderate themselves and for posts more than 90 days old, a comment standing by itself (as we see in the screen when we handle them) needs to be really bad for me to cast a binding delete vote. 

In general, a question with dozens of votes might merit the time to go to the post, look at why the comment might be obsolete and might need to be cleaned up is worth the time. 

Comments also show how edits make posts better - I'm on the fence if they do more good than harm in the case of the flags you raised. Please comment here if I missed something harmful about the two posts. I'm open to re-evaluating them if needed. 

To incorporate your excellent comments below - there are discussions similar to ours on the main meta:

The first two share your confusion / dis-satisfaction on the process and you are not alone / wrong from my standpoint. The second two discuss the moderation side - where https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/261071/165931one quote is "I'm skeptical that these flags are the right way to handle these comments period: they require entirely too much work for the potential benefit in most cases."

Tell me please why do we have the opportunity to flag comment as obsolete?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Please comment here if I missed something harmful about the two posts." They were not harmful - they were obsolete.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you decline obsolete comments - you can simply ignore such a flags (on comments). If you think the opportunity to flag some comment obsolete - is obsolete itself :) So we don't need it. We can discuss it on meta and maybe its time to forbid such a flag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you @MikroDel -  I would vote for / support a proposal on the main meta to remove the obsolete flag from comments based on my experience moderating this site. I believe that code is common to all sites, so any change to that code would get discussed on http://meta.stackexchange.comb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've updated my post with some relevant discussions on the moderation aspects of comments. To be clear, the problem isn't with your use of the flags - it's with other people that flag wrongly or want to suppress someone's comment that isn't really obsolete and the human nature of people that handle the flags (i.e. I'm part of the problem.). Comment flags about not constructive (when the comment is actually constructive) are huge false positive. Comment flags about rude are very often not rude. So the obsolete flags arrive in the same flag workflow where false positive is high.

Specifically for the question at hand

If the "me too" poster is using Yosemite a new question with the same topic will (correctly IMHO) be closed as a duplicate. If they have additional information, they can edit it directly into the question. But Yosemite probably isn't used very much anymore, so I doubt Darryl will get an answer anyway.

Generally speaking

The topic has come up before, see https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2788/should-i-answer-an-existing-old-question-or-ask-answer-my-own-new-question?rq=1Should I answer an existing old question or ask/answer my own new question?

I flagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/272082/88313an answer as abusive because of the derogatory language the author used to reference another user (the answer has since been edited but you can see the original text in the edit history).  I was using https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/what-are-the-spam-and-rude-or-abusive-offensive-flags-and-how-do-they-wor/58035#58035this post as my guide for what constitutes 'abuse'.

The flag reviewer responded with a question to me:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/hoDQi.png

I don't want the reviewer to think I'm an idiot and I want them to know why I flagged it as I did (I don't want to argue that it was declined, that's within their right).

Basically flags are for things where the normal tools cannot fix the issue. In this case, an edit handled it which is why the flag was declined. 

Keep in mind, when we review flags we see the current post and not the original. The behavior was both rude and offensive so I've suspended the account in question temporarily.

Is this the correct forum to addressing flag questions asked by a Mod?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes @fsb - all moderation questions can be asked here - even if you have a private question you can ask for a private mod chat room to be set up. Asking here pings all the site mods much faster than by chat or pinging us with a flag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However in this case surely flag as abusive should do more than just do an edit - the OP needs to have action taken against him even if the reason was edited out by someone else.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nope. The referenced guide is clear: "If an otherwise valid post contains vulgar words as an expression of frustration, edit the bad part out instead of flagging the entire post as rude or abusive."

Only Apple employees know why Apple decides to do something one way or the other, and they usually are not talking about it. That's why questions about why Aplle does this or that are off-topic (as documented in the help center).

Tags exist to help with filtering: people who want to find or not see questions about particular topics use tags to do this. While it is quite conceivable that someone might be an expert on or uninterested in Thunderbolt or USB or Ethernet, I don't see who the population would be that would be interested or uninterested in dongles generically.  This, I suggest that in the absence of evidence demonstrating that population exists, we are better off without this tag.

Examples include the top three site tags, macos, macbook and iphone. Why do they exist? According to your logic, they should be replaced with things like "macbook monitor", "macbook keyboard", "iphone wifi". The top question in the macbook section isn't even about macbooks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The fact that generic tags tend to be applied inconsistently is a clear indicator that we shouldn't add *more* such tags. But generally speaking, generic tags with a huge number of matching questions make more sense because they allow users to filter for (or against them). People using iOS devices with PCs may not be interested in any question tagged "macOS", "macbook" and such for instance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to say that the explanation offered by @patrix makes a lot of sense. Tags already exist for _ethernet_, _thunderbolt_, _USB_, _firewire_, _HDMI_, etc. One _could_ argue that there should be a tag for every type of port (e.g. there isn't currently a _SCSI_ tag), but in time tags get created by users themselves when they have enough reputation (300). For example, I recently answered a couple of questions about SheepSaver and, in editing those questions, I created a _SheepSaver_ tag. But if memory serves me correctly, this tag will drop off if it's not used again within six months.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5MacBook macOS and iOS all make sense as tags. Plenty of people want to read questions  about iOS; others want to avoid iOS questions and only look at Mac questions. The problem isn't that "dongles" is generic; generic is good. The problem is that it isn't coherent.


















I had asked a question on the IoT and they immediately migrated it over to Ask Different, where it sat for a while (almost 2 weeks) and no answers.

A moderator from Ask Different thought it should be asked again in IoT and told me how to do it, which I did. I flagged my question, deleted it, and when that happened, I reopened the question "A splitter to carry more than just audio"

Well today I was beaten up pretty bad, from asking a duplicate question to being off topic, then when asked what I though IoT meant I answered it and was, well, told lawyering will not help.

I'm a member of very small group of developers, including the creator of SpriteBASIC and Mike Westerfield, who wrote techBASIC, and basically wrote the book on IoT.

I knew he was trying very hard to finish his new book, and I had already wrote him a lengthy paper about math and number in techBASIC, but I decided that I needed an expert to see if there was an answer, so I asked him the question as written here and he responded back.

I flagged the moderator telling what happened over at IoT and that I had an answer. It isn't pretty but a starting point, and asked for him to undelete and unlock so I can anwser the question here.

However, my question is still locked.

How do I go about getting it unlocked so I can answer the question which may start more people helping me or at least I will have an answer to close out the question and get my dignity back (I lost all my reputation points in the IoT, I will not repeat any comments as this is not the place for it).

I would like a positive outcome on this.

Also, besides writing a request here, it there a way that the person who asked the question can request it be unlocked by allowing him to flag the unlock itself? Or something that would be done in a way that would not require a request here or in a chat (not everyone has chat privileges).

I don't agree with the advice you received to ask again on IoT.SE. You should never repost a question, so I understand how that may not have been well received. Rather, the original question should have been reopened if that was the right site for the question. I'm not sure you've asked this on the correct Meta though — wouldn't this be better asked at the IoT meta rather than Ask Different? Also, neither of your questions on IoT are locked and I don't see what Community has to do with your question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside I agree, but bouncing it back to IoT was not an option at the time the issue came at.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would ask them, but it was locked when I deleted it. I'm pretty new to Stack Exchange and When they said that the question was migrated of IoT to Ask Different, what was there to reopen on IoT if it no longer existed? Now I did not lose any reputation points on that same question on AD, just all of them on IoT.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Could you expand on this comment? I'm not sure I fully understand what you said, am I missing some context?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@George Migrated questions aren't removed from the original site; they're still there and can be reopened if necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside The question was migrated from IoT to AD on Feb 19th. It didn't gather a lot of attention, but when I tried to bounce it back to IoT on Feb 25th I wasn't able to reject the migration any longer (I assume there is a time limit for this, didn't follow up on this though). That's why I recommended to ask for a reopen on IoT directly instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside Thanks. I'll never make that mistake again, and part of the answer I got from Mike Westerfield is hardware and Apple policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside Unfortunately the question seems to be off-topic on IoT in general (see comments there), which left George's question in a rather strange state.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Seems like something got misinterpreted then, because asking for reopening is definitely the best scenario but OP reposted the entire question, leading to usual downvotes and duplicate closure. This seems to be where the problem is here unless I'm misunderstanding this Meta question entirely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've edited the title to try to be closer to what I believe is the problem here. Feel free to edit further or if the reference to Community was part of the problem.


















If you really need more than 5 minutes to edit a comment, delete the comment and comment again. The limit is there to prevent people rewriting history, by altering a comment which has already been replied to or to which other action has been taken because of it. The 5 minute limit matches the grace period for post edits that don't cause a revision.

Sorry, the locking was my mistake. I was handling the flag while on the commute back home and didn't realize that the question was both deleted and locked. It's unlocked now.

Thanks for your understanding and help.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GeorgeMcGinn Things related to your IoT post need to be addressed at the meta site of IoT.

After digging around on the badges page, I came across the fact that there hasn't been an election on the site since 2013. Is there a reason for that or is it just an error?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No more elections?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All past elections are listed at https://apple.stackexchange.com/election (no need to dig in the badges). There is also a [network-wide page](http://elections.stackexchange.com/) which shows that 4 sites went without a mod election for longer than [apple.se]: namely, [programmers.se], [drupal.se], [tex.se], and [gamedev.se]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NormalHuman - Ok so tell me if I'm wrong here, but here is what I have gathered: There are 9 mod spots, 7 of which are currently occupied. Moderators can hold their positions as long as they like, and an election is triggered whenever there are 3 open spots. Does that all sound right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Elections are triggered when the workload on the mod team gets too big. With the growing number of high-rep users the load is actually decreasing so there isn't much load on the mods right now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jackson1442 The "9 mod spots" part is incorrect. There is no target number of moderators; whether more are needed depends on their workload, and that's when elections happen (as patrix wrote above).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NormalHuman I just gathered that from the system-wide elections page you referred me to. It says there are two open spots, so there must be a max of nine to prevent mass chaos.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't see a reference to 9 mod slots. Are you refering to the list of past elections on https://apple.stackexchange.com/election? This is just a list of past and current moderators, it doesn't imply a fixed number (on the contrary, don't think there ever have been more than five or six active mods on AD at any point in time).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the 9 mod slots is from http://elections.stackexchange.com/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah: "moderator candidates: 7; moderator positions available: 2"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5right, right right... when you say like that, you make it more clear that there are seven running for 2 spots :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix ooooooohhhhhh ok the text was out of line bc of my screen scaling or something and it looked like it said 7 moderators, 2 positions available


















Just to answer this and summarize what already came up in the comments:


Different SE sites have different number of moderators, there is no fixed number of moderator slots. The size of the moderator team is primarily driven by the overall workload of moderating the site (which again depends on the activity level of the site itself, the number of higher-rep users doing mod duties etc.). StackOverflow currently has 22 moderators :-) 
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99512/when-do-moderator-elections-take-placeWhen do moderator elections take place? has more detail, especially


  Most elections are scheduled as a result of moderators reaching out to Stack Exchange to ask for additional help.

Also, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278633/moderators-are-elected-for-life-yet-we-hold-regular-elections-how-comeModerators are elected for life, yet “We hold regular elections”. How come? might give some more information on this


Specifically for AskDifferent, the mod workload is rather low, especially thanks to all the higher-rep users who take a lot of work off our shoulders. Unless this changes (and/or unless one or two of the current mods decide to step down) there isn't an urgent need to grow the moderator team.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One of the things I really like about this site is, as stated in the help pages, _There is little difference between users with high reputation and ♦ moderators. That is intentional. We don’t run this site. The community does_. Thanks for your answer - it confirms the site is working well and it's good to know that as we build reputation we're genuinely able to contribute to the maintenance of this site. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth Absolutely! From a mod point of view the site seems to run on auto-pilot sometimes :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I want to chime in as well. The moderation by many people without diamonds is superb, timely, kind and direct. We are seeing the results of that clearly as the tools to handle flags and locate spam have kept ahead of the small minority that is here to cause trouble. The moderation needed lately is generally pointing people to meta discussions.


















I've only been having this problem for the past few days, but since it hasn't resolved itself I thought I'd post here to see if it's been reported.

Basically, my review counter seems to be out of whack. For example, I refer to the image below:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pRae.png

As you can see, it's showing nine items in the queue. However, when I go in to review the items, I see a tally of zero next to all the review queues. In some cases there are some items to review, but these do not add to the total shown in the counter (but this I understand as the queue may just be getting cleared).

However, I know there is an issue here because as I type this, the review counter is still showing 9 but upon going to review the items they all have a tally of zero (and I've tested this fact in multiple browsers on multiple Macs).

So, has this been reported? Is it only affecting Ask Different, or is it across the Stack Exchange network?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Incorrect review 'counter'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There probably is already a question about this either here or on meta.stackexchange.com. AFAIR the counter shows the number of entries overall, not the number of entries pending for you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @patrix - I haven't noticed this previously until a few days ago, so I feel whatever is happening now is somehow _different_ to what was happening previously. Just to clarify, when I posted the above question I checked in three browsers on two separate Macs, and in all cases it showed 9 items to be reviewed, and in all cases clicking on the _Review_ link showed me no items in any of the queues, although the counter still showed 9 items. Then, when I _refreshed_ the site, it still showed me that there are 9 items in the queue, even though there aren't any.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The situation is the same for every user. It doesn't matter whether you refresh, posts pending reviews by other users will still get counted even after you've completed your reviewb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I see what you're saying. Thanks for the clarification. :) I crossed over the 10K mark a few days back, so that's probably why it's more obvious to me. Makes sense now! Thanks again! :)


















The top bar counter isn't specific to your user, whilst the /review page counters are. This means…


Reviewing a post in the queue that still requires 1+ other users review too, you won't see the review task any more on /review but it'll still increment the top bar counter.
If you've reviewed a post outside of a queue, you won't be able to review it again.
This doesn't apply to you, but also <5k reputation users see tag wiki suggested edits increment the top bar but won't be shown in /review.
…and of course some http://shouldiblamecaching.comcopious caching.

It is a minor matter of comfort, but can I customize the Markdown editor on Ask Different?

In part of my research, I clicked my avatar at the top and then Settings > Preferences.  On that page there is a Keyboard shortcuts option, but that is not what I am after.  

I am very used to the key bindings that Safari provides on other sites, or even in the "Search Q&A" box and the Title on Stack Exchange sites.  Some work but others do not.  For example, Control-K to kill to the end of the line gets intercepted for entering preformatted text, and Control-B to move Backward one character gets intercepted for strong text.  I am afraid I am an old school Emacser who prefers Control-B to left-arrow sometimes.  

I have some tolerable work-arounds for this, so I guess I'm mainly interested if there is a setting I haven't found, or if it is worthwhile making a feature request to our gracious hosts.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/277800/why-does-the-larger-ipad-pro-support-fewer-lte-bands-than-the-smaller-oneWhy does the larger iPad pro support fewer LTE bands than the smaller one?

This was VTC'd despite not being "based on opinion, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise." In specific, the accepted answer which was accepted before the last two close votes came in, is purely factual and not opinion based in any way.

I take issue with the idea of a discussion about hardware design, something that's as concrete as it gets, being closed in this fashion, especially when the answer boils down to "it's an older device". Also acceptable would have been size/battery life/etc concerns, but you'll note that neither of those are opinion based either.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my question closed asking why Apple didn’t implement a hardware feature in a specific device?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another closed question in the "why did Apple do X?" Pattern. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/278261/usb-c-wall-charger


















https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/close/200176I voted to leave this question open in the queue and have voted to reopen again now. I disagree that this question is opinion-based and when I saw the question in the review queue I was going to answer with something similar to the answer that was given. The question can be read as asking why Apple made some design decision, which is likely opinion-based, however this question is not written like this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The answer provided is still mostly speculation. Unless someone wants to look at the cellular protocol chips in each device and cross reference them with availability from the manufacturers it's mostly a guess. Pretty good guess. But speculations nonetheless.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ian Speculation in an answer alongside facts doesn't diminish the answer. [I occasionally include speculation](https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A37797+%22I+speculate%22) at the end of my answer where it may provide useful information even if it doesn't answer the question in itself. Here, the actual answer is "The larger iPad Pro was released before the smaller one" and "the larger model wasn't "restricted" - it was released the year before the smaller model" — that's a perfectly satisfactory answer and resolves the confusion that OP had.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But there's no facts in the answer. The devices could have the exact same chips with feature sets being disabled/enabled differently, right? I would have closed this question, honestly.


















I voted to close the question as primarily opinion based.

When I reviewed the question, I saw that you pointed out two iPads with 'theoretical maximums' and asked 'why is the larger unit restricted?'.

My reading of that was that it could only be answered by someone who participated in the design and development of those devices.  That would be Apple.  As such, the question was considered off-topic because questions regarding why Apple does/doesn't do this as well as why they do what they do can only be answered by Apple.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In addition to good subjective / bad subjective, this is simply off topic. I've changed the close reason to indicate that more clearly. Once it's on topic, we can resume discussion of opinion based. As written now, it's both off topic and opinion based. Neither close reason sits with me as wrong.


















Just rephrase it as "Are there any objective reasons why the larger iPad Pro would support fewer LTE bands than the smaller one?" Then it's immune to being closed as subjective or opinion-based, since you've ruled out that kind of answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This doesn't get around the off topic close reason. This site closes "why did Apple do X" questions as off topic . The best way to get these reopened is to focus on the practical thing someone wants to do. So, "given that Apple has relaxed th she two devices with X characteristic, how do I accomplish Y?"  The fault of the post being discussed is there is no Y to answer. Focusing on objective is a red herring here.

A very simple question with a very simple answer, yet for some reason, both answers are being provided in the question comments. Both users have a ton of rep (5k and 8k). 

Why not just give the answer the usual way? I see this happen a lot, and I'm tempted to just drop a duplicate in the answer box just to boost the all important score. Bad form or..?

The question you link to is rather unclear actually: is the user not finding Activity Monitor (as the first sentence implied) or are they looking for ways to solve the actual problem of the computer running hot? So it's kind of understandable that people use the comment section to get basic issues out of the way and then focus on the actual problem in the answer.

In other words: Answers in the comment section are a good indicator that the question needs to be improved by editing.

I've been wondering this for a while and thought it was time I sought some guidance. 

Often when I review a low quality post I will add a comment such as the one below:


  Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer. :) Unfortunately, short answers such as this don't really provide enough detail or context to help many users. If possible, it'd be good if you could add some more info on how tabbing 20 or so times will address this issue. Also, you may want to read https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-answerHow to Answer for tips on providing answers here.


Now, after adding the comment I still have to choose between: 


Looks OK
Edit
Recommend Deletion, or 
Skip.


Obviously to me the answer is not okay, and I can't edit it because I haven't come across this 'solution' before. I also don't want to Skip this as I feel it needs addressing. So this leaves me with no choice but to recommend deletion.

My concern is, if I select Recommend Deletion then perhaps we end up deleting an answer that actually resolves the issue for the OP. And, we potentially delete an answer before the user gets the chance to edit/improve it.

So I guess I'm after guidance on what has been established as best practice in these situations?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Reviewing 'low quality posts' - when to recommend deletion of answerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for bringing this up.  As a new Ask Different user a few months ago, I posted a too-short answer (new to SE; didn't fully understand the best practice) and watched it get deleted pretty much right away by a moderator without so much as a comment, which spoiled my first impression of the site and still leaves me with a bad taste.


















"It's ok" is sometimes more a "I'm done with reviewing this post" than a "The post is ok".

You think the post is valid but may need some editing, so leave a comment and move on. Flagging it for deletion will lead to deletion (at least if other users agree), if that is not what you want don't click on it :-)

The basic rule I usually apply is: "is the user trying to move the topic forward by at least attempting to provide an answer." If yes, then there is no reason to delete the answer. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks Patrix! I really like the _basic rule_ you apply. I think I'll use that as a guiding principle too! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth the second rule probably is something like "why comment if I can easily fix the answer myself", but that is something you already are aware of :-)

I don't think we need a specific https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ftpsftps tag right now. The question you linked just happens to be using FTPS, rather than being about FTPS. There's no questions I can find which are specific to the secure version of FTP — only about FTP in general. The standard tag of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ftpftp will suffice.

For now, I'm inclined to agree with George, but please explain how you see starting this would help.


















There is no easy way to do it. Right now your sole option is to visit the transcript(s) you want to download then save the pages themselves locally through your browser (File → Save As or whatever). You'll have to do this individually for every day you want to save.

The general form of the transcript URLs (that the View Transcripts link takes you to), if you ever want to visit one directly, is:

http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/89/2017/4/6/0-21


Where, taking the parts of that example:


chat.meta.stackexchange.com is the chat server (SE has a few).
89 is the chat room ID.
2017 is the year.
4 is the month.
6 is the day.
0-21 is the time of day to view the transcript for.


So one tiny trick you can use is for busy rooms where the transcript of a day is divided into time blocks, just use 0-24 on the end and you can view the whole day. That's about as much as you get in terms of shortcuts.

That said, incidentally, I wrote a utility to scrape all the transcripts of a given room recently, and plan on creating a little web application in the very near future to let folks browse chat transcripts and search chat more easily (and pull fun stats, like emoji leader boards and such). I'll try to remember to post back here when I do, or just ping me in http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/rooms/89/tavern-on-the-metaThe Tavern.

But, other than writing your own tool to scrape transcripts, no, there's no way to mass download transcripts aside from visiting each day and just saving the page (which might be just fine for your needs).

Note that there's also a Load to my last message button on the main chat window, so if you're trying to catch up, sometimes that button is helpful (but not always), and you can save the web page to your computer if you want to read it later.

Thanks. This happens when a question is migrated in to the site. The system makes an "untagged" tag if none exist so us deleting the tag isn't going to prevent this tomorrow when the next migration happens.

The best thing for you and others to do is to edit the question to have the correct tags for here - anyone can do that. If the question needs other edits to clarify or fix syntax, do that as well.

Worst case - you can vote to close the question if it's not up to the site standards or ask here like you did.

Thanks for the heads up the question needs an edit. If it's not already fixed, I'll have a pass at editing / closing it.

The OP created multiple questions for the same issue.  I flagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/281314/how-can-i-tell-if-my-iphone-has-been-hacked-or-tampered-withthis one for mod attention with the comment: 


  This question is a repost of the OPs same question:
  apple.stackexchange.com/questions/281274/…


The flag was declined with the explanation:


  declined - Duplicate only applies if the original question has
  answers.


I didn't think I flagged it as 'duplicate', because the original question didn't have an answer, but maybe I did (if so, that was a mistake).  

The question is now closed as a duplicate which is why I flagged it for Mod attention in the first place.

Can I get the 'declined' flag off my account?

Also imo that flag should not have been declined, but we'll see what the mods say.


















I probably would have accepted it, as did the mod who handled the second "duplicate" flag. It mainly shows that mods are humans too :-)

As for the declined flag: Declined flags can't be removed, see https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/138674/can-a-flag-decision-be-reversedCan a flag decision be reversed? and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/136876/can-a-declined-flag-be-reverted-or-removed-from-historyCan a declined flag be reverted or removed from history? for details. You shouldn't worry about any negative effects here. The badges we have for flagging only count helpful flags, and if you keep flagging well this won't matter at all. I have a few declined flags myself, and they didn't hurt me in any way.

Thanks for asking, and for avoiding a cross-post.

Generally the question seems to be on-topic on both sites (at least as long as you are looking for end user solutions and don't want to develop your own piece of code). So if you don't get an answer on the Unix site, please flag it and have a moderator over there migrate it to AD.

You can answer questions, except for a tiny percentage which are protected.

The question in your screenshot was protected automatically since there were many answers posted to that question which did not answer the question (spam, "me too", "thanks", etc) and have since been removed.

Users who have joined Ask Different will see the Answers for your Apple questions description at top left of all Ask Different pages (see below):

https://i.stack.imgur.com/flXC6.png

However, new users looking through the list of all Stack Exchange sites see the following description instead:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/uEroT.png

As you can see, the description they see is: Q&A for power users of Apple hardware and software.

I propose that we change the description used for Ask Different so that potential new users are not scared off from joining/asking questions simply because they think the site is for 'power users'.

More specifically, I propose either of the following:

 Proposal 1 - Replace the description on the list of sites so that it matches the description used on the actual site (i.e. we use Answers for your Apple questions as the description in both locations).


Proposal 2 - Edit the description on the list of sites so that the word 'power' is removed and it now reads Q&A for users of Apple hardware and software.
Proposal 3 - Edit the description on the list of sites so that it now reads Q&A for enthusiasts and power users of Apple hardware and software.


UPDATE


I have removed Proposal 1 based on https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3024/168832grgarside's answer.
I have added Proposal 3.
Below is some context on why I started thinking about this.


Yesterday I answered this https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/283887/168832question. It's since been edited, but originally it ended with:


  I’m sorry to ask such a newbie question, so if this isn’t the site (your description says “Q&A for power users of Apple hardware and software” and I am no power user), then a link to a resource for Mac newbies would be appreciated.


My reading of this is that the OP was hesitant to ask their question here. And, if they felt this way based on our description, then how many others might there be?

Finally, when a new user first goes to sign up, the description appears immediately above the sign up button (see below) and this may act as a final hurdle.

Proposal 0 — It remains as it is.


Proposal 1 isn't suitable: the list of site descriptions are always of the form ‘Q&A for [scope]’.
Proposal 2 might be ok, but I don't think it's necessary. Many site descriptions use ‘power’ for the reasons discussed in:

http://askdifferent.comhttp://askdifferent.com performs a 301 redirect to http://apple.stackexchange.comhttp://apple.stackexchange.com.
https://askdifferent.comhttps://askdifferent.com doesn't work: connection refused.


With the move to HTTPS across Stack Exchange, can the HTTPS redirection be functional?

A more minor related issue: can the redirect from the HTTP redirect directly to the HTTPS URL?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5askdifferent.com does not redirect when HTTPSb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5to turn it around... did it ever work with https? why do you expect it to work now? During the move we've rewritten all askdifferent.com links to apple.se, there are no links to askdifferent in the network anymore, only external ones, and those were never https, since it never worked. This behavior is the same of other pointer domains as well (e.g. miyodeya.com)


















Let's get this over to the main thread for https transition. 


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/292058/network-wide-https-its-timeNetwork-wide HTTPS: It's time


According to the main post we should be status: done with only chat not on https. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why does this need to be moved to main meta? It only affects this siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't need to go. It just could go. Other sites with side identities need cleanup too in all likelihood. Looks like we have an answer now, though.


















TL;DR: This will happen as a result of mostly unrelated cleanup efforts.



To clarify our position here: there were no plans to make the redirect-only domains available over https://. They were never at any point in time supported, nor do we generate links to them - so all links in existence should be http://.

Even if they were https://, they wouldn't get the benefits of https:// anyway, since they're just 301s to the site's real domain). There's really very little reason to take on the certificate complexity and cost to add these additional domains.

Not that being said, this will eventually happen anyway for other reasons. As simply as a side-effect of us shuffling redirects between https://www.name.com/name.com servers and https://www.cloudflare.com/Cloudflare for redirects. We did this for https://miyodeya.commiyodeya.com for the purposes of existing SE 1.0 links - since they ever existed, not supporting this on name.com's redirect service was causing (effectively) 404s to actual content.

We moved them to our miscellaneous Cloudflare account for the purposes of redirects, supporting https:// is only a side-effect. But, maintaining 2 ways of doing something when 1 is saner/easier (we're almost done automating this) is just silly. So the plan is to move all these domains to Cloudflare. Here's the list:


nothingtoinstall.com
seasonedadvice.com
crossvalidated.com
basicallymoney.com
chiphacker.com
brewadvice.com
askpatents.com
miyodeya.com


I don't have an exact timeline as the main dev on the sync bits for Cloudflare/page rules is currently moving and out for a little while. Roughly, I'd say in the next month or two.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should be done much sooner than a month or two. Just finalizing and merging in our code to manage cloudflare redirects. https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/pull/119 is the PR on that, just needs a couple of safety features and I will wire up all those alias domains to work properly.


















From some brief comments in AD Chat, it appears we currently have one spare slot for a new close reason.

I would like to propose a 'zero research' type reason - though I'm open to suggestions on the precise wording.

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/37797/grgarsidegrgarside mentioned that he already has a standard comment he uses for 'no research on code/applescript' type questions...


  Questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved. Include attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results.


which I think is fine for that specific case, but I think we need something more generic to cover the 'really didn't bother' questions on all topics.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askHow to Ask page is already the best place to point these, as research is the opening section, but we have just the already very broad Basic Customer Support close reason pointing to it, which I don't think we need to add more sub-clauses to.

I'm assuming it would need to go in the off-topic closure, which feels a bit odd, but if customer support fits there, then I guess no research could too.

I propose something along the lines of 


  Questions must demonstrate a reasonable amount of research & understanding of the problem being solved. Please edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it, including attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results.


which is, of course, borrowing heavily from the above.

The floor is open for better suggestions.

Is it on the first screen you get when you first go to close a question (i.e. the one listing 5 options, starting with _duplicate of..._ and finishing with _primarily opinion-based_? Or is it on the  Off-Topic screen instead (i.e. the one listing 4 options, starting with _Basic Customer Support...._ etc?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Honestly, idk. @patrix mentioned it in Chat - "We do have one custom close reason left. If you want to pitch for it, please raise it on Meta" so hopefully he can fill us in on the details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth We can define up to three site-specific "Off Topic" close reasons (in addition to the standard ones for migration and "other"). Of these three there are currently only two in use.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Generally speaking it might take some effort to clearly differentiate between the already existing "Customer Support" reason and the one proposed here. I have the feeling that they are indeed different, but we may need to reword the "Customer Support" reason as well to make the distinction more obvious.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've always actually thought the customer support one is a bit 'busy', trying to cover too much in one go. I guess it does partly cover the no research area - but it lumps CS in with 'opinionated' rather clumsily. I'm adding a pic of the CS close to my question for easy reference. perhaps this needs a revamp, in tandem with adding a new one??b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree! I've always felt the _Customer support_ reason was somewhat clumsy. I think it could definitely do with an edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Essentially, if we leave the 'coding == SO' as it is, then we have 3 close reasons we need to squeeze into the space for 2... CS, shopping & no research. That might take some skilled wording.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are two types of coding questions: clearly off-topic ones (ObjC or Swift coding issue) and badly researched on-topic ones (AppleScript, shell scripts and such). The latter one fits onto the "no research" category and may need to be reflected in the wording somehow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I sure wish we had this on electronics.stackexchange.com. So many homework questions without effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BrianCarlton can you believe that there are sites that *have* that close reason and [want to get rid of it](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3735/15751)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very related status-declined Meta SE post: [Introduce a “general reference” close reason](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/86043/270345), also see links in the related blog post [Are Some Questions Too Simple?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/02/22/are-some-questions-too-simple/) discussions in other sites.


















Proposal ported to answer space for voting purposes/comments...


  Questions must demonstrate a reasonable amount of research & understanding of the problem being solved. Please edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it, including attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results.

If I was going to change anything, it would only be to add something like _This will help the community to better provide a good answer to your problem._b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great way to make this clear for votes. I"m tempted to first split the "basic troubleshooting" from the "off site resource" close reason first though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This may require further refinement, for sure. It was essentially a punt in the right direction rather than an attempt to fix it all in one go. Perhaps it can be resolved in comments/potential answers, then a final "this is what's going to happen" answer put in at the end...


















I have finished automating this, and askdifferent.com redirects should be working much better than they were. I expect all of these urls to properly redirect properly over http and https(possibly pending DNS ttl expiry):

May I ask why the redirects are 302 over 301?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The 302s are just temporary while we validate and roll out the automated setup for them. Will convert to 301s once we are fully confident they will work.


















The rainbow is always there and the black gets drawn on top. My hunch is something is happening on the network or in the browser to drop the connection when you don't get the whole page rendered.

This brings to mind a saying I'll paraphrase poorly:


  I never learn things when things work. It's only when they break that you can easily peek inside and see what connects where, how the whole is assembled and how it was designed to work together as one. Be sure to pay attention when things break, because that's when the learning comes more easily.


Also, hopefully someone with more expertise can come in and illuminate my broken answer. There's probably a great explanation for how the page is built other than "probably network since you have multiple devices / browsers" seeing the same breakage. You could also ask on the main site how to inspect the page to pick apart what resources / scripts do what. The steps are a little different based on Safari/Chrome or particular OS in play.

I might actually start tracking it for a few weeks just to see if I can isolate it down to particular circumstances.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth Not in a long while - we had horrible buffer bloat one weekend on the internet - tons of lost packets, etc.. Basically the network was in bad shape.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still see the rainbow header whenever opening apple.stackexchange.com. Any way to get rid of this? I tried clearing the browser cache, but it did not help...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nwinkler if the issue persists on multiple days or multiple browsers a follow on question with the browser / os specifics would let the developers know to look into it.


















I'm tempted to try and roll this in to the Basic Customer support close reason. That close reason isn't here, so you can use this and other in the mean time:


  I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's a https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2508/why-were-not-customer-support-for-company-x-or-product-yBasic Customer support question. Please see the meta post linked above for details on how to proceed if you can edit the post and have the hold reviewed. 


We currently have these two custom options:


Questions asking to http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254393/recommend or find a Mac, book, tool, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit this question to http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askdescribe the problem and what research has been done so far to solve it.
Questions about software development are off-topic here, but can be asked on https://stackoverflow.com/aboutStack Overflow.


The Basic Customer Support wording is removed from the "off site" resource close reason since people felt odd choosing it when both didn't apply as well as people with closed questions didn't get that they had to only fix half of the problems - not address both "support" and "research" constraints.

Since we only get three custom close reasons - do we still need this second  "not enough research" reason?

I could see adding some of the proposed wording here to "basic customer support" close reason so we have used all 3 of 3 custom close reasons.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm with you so far - but it's shining examples like these - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/284653/please-give-me-any-email-id-for-creating-a-new-icloud-id & https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/284650/icloud-storage-downgraded-to-5gb-for-no-reason which are classics in their own right. 1st is truly clueless, 2nd is definitely CS. I'd struggle to VTC the first as CS. It could go down as 'unclear', I guess.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ahhh... a late thought... can we customise the 'unclear' to include zero research? Thoughts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tetsujin We can't change the 'unclear what you are asking' reason just for ADb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix - I had my suspicions it wouldn't be a moddable parameter.


















Today I came across the http://apple.blogoverflow.comAsk Different Blog, something I had no idea even existed.

Noting that the last entry is dated 6 October 2015, I started to wonder whether it had quietly died at some point, so I searched around Meta and found these three posts:


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/666/is-anyone-interested-in-starting-managing-and-or-writing-for-an-ask-different-bIs anyone interested in starting, managing and/or writing for an Ask Different blog?
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/974/can-we-make-the-askdifferent-blog-more-easily-accessibleCan we make the AskDifferent blog more easily accessible?
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/811/the-ask-different-blog-is-looking-for-contributorsThe Ask Different Blog is looking for contributors


I didn't seem to find anything that related to us no longer having a blog.

Obviously I don't know the history of the blog, (heck, I still feel like a newbie around here), but I've taken the time today to have a good look around and it seems to me to have once been a valuable resource. 

In fact, the site even used it to run competitions (with real prizes) and at some point even had Ask Different gift swags (shirts, stickers, etc). And, for a while we even had a series of Ask Different http://apple.blogoverflow.com/category/podcast/podcasts being produced.

Now, I am not saying we should go back to running competitions and offering prizes, or producing podcasts (I know these things require time and money), but my point is that presumably at some point the blog was quite active and successful (it even had a dedicated Ask Different http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1408/ask-different-blogBlog chat). And it may have even been a good promotional/marketing tool for Ask Different as a whole (e.g. this Ask Different http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/keyboard-ninja-working-with-text-screencast/screencast on Vimeo seems to have been a Vimeo staff pick at one time). 

My questions are:


Do we actually still have a blog?
If no, (i) when did it stop; and (ii) why did it stop (i.e. low readership, not enough contributors, etc)?
If yes, (i) how do we get involved; and (ii) how can we promote it?


In summary, it seems to me that getting the blog going again may be possible as we've got more users joining the site daily and some of these have been very active in the period since the last blog post.

I for one would be more than happy to get involved.

[UPDATE 1]

Since posting the question I've found and discovered some history to all this.

This blog... 


  ...was originally a part of Blog Overflow, a network of blogs linked to
  Stack Exchange sites. Blog Overflow has since been discontinued, but
  the written articles will remain here for future readers.


For full details you can read https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291741/we-will-no-longer-be-hosting-blog-overflowWe will no longer be hosting Blog Overflow.

In summary, the three main reasons were:


The vast majority of blogs weren't really active
WordPress is a meaty beast to sustain as a self-hosted service and not worth the effort for something that resulted in little activity
Blogs can work with us while being external to us.


In light of this, I guess if the demand was there, we could create a blog offsite. So, my question could become a discussion on whether doing so was something this community wanted to do?

[Update 2]

Added three polling answers. Please vote for whichever answer represents your view. 

No need for any down votes - just up vote one of the polls only.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Poll: Ask Different Blogb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we do go for a blog, I'm definitely up for hosting/etc a new WordPress blog — I could create a WP theme, either which represents the site design in aspects or is something new, and I have experience with the SE API and could integrate the SE login API for SSO. I might be wrong, but I don't think this site is active enough for this kind of thing right now? However, an idea I had a while ago was around how many people on this site have blogs of their own: perhaps it might be worth adding the RSS feeds to the Ask Different Chat, which might spur conversation about those topics?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This sounds good to me. :) I keep checking the stats on the main Stack Exchange communities page for an idea on how active we are, but there's not a lot there. And sometimes these stats can be interpreted multiple ways. We get 203k visitors daily, but only 39 questions daily. Some would be quick to jump to the conclusion that's a bad result, but it could also be a good indicator that most people are already finding answers to their Qs and don't need to ask a new one. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Obviously I can't vote on my own answers, but I'm happy to also get involved. Hmm, it didn't occur to me until just now that the _Yes let's have a blog and I can contribute_ answer doesn't indicate __who__ can help, so if we go ahead we'd need a separate Q to actually call for those who can help. In the meantime I may edit the Answer to ask people to add a comment they're voting to say they can contribute.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside Re your earlier comment: *However, an idea I had a while ago was around how many people on this site have blogs of their own: perhaps it might be worth adding the RSS feeds to the Ask Different Chat, which might spur conversation about those topics?* - I was just wondering how you see this working? Also, do you happen to know any other examples of RSS feeds going to a SE chat?


















We do not have a blog.

It stopped in March: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291741/we-will-no-longer-be-hosting-blog-overflowWe will no longer be hosting Blog Overflow

The reasoning is three-fold in basic:


The vast majority of blogs aren't really active. 
WordPress is meaty to sustain self-hosted.
Blogs can continue externally - they allowed each site to export data if requested.


For us specifically, the Ask Different Blog was very not active. We spent more time moderating spam comments than creating content, we didn't export the data since it exists statically hosted for scraping if someone wants to start up an external blog for the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Haha, yes, I just discovered all this and updated my question. I guess I could add a couple of polling answers: one for Yes, lets create one externally and one for No, let's not - just to see what people think.


















Poll -- Yes, we should have an external blog for the site, and I can contribute
Yes, we should have a blog and I would be happy to contribute.

As most of us know, each year Apple hosts its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Typically, Apple launches the WWDC with a keynote address during which it introduces upcoming software and hardware. 

This year the conference will be held in San Jose, California, from Monday 5 June until Friday 9 June.

Below is part of the invite Apple issued for the event:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3VDe.png

My proposal is that we hold a live chat event right here using http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatAsk Different Chat. The way I see this working is that we invite users to join us in chat as the WWDC announcements unfold.

Expected announcements 


iOS 11
macOS 10.13
tvOS 11
watchOS 4.


Rumoured announcements 


Revised MacBook, MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models
A totally new Siri Smart Speaker (similar to Amazon Echo or Google Home)
A new 10.5" iPad Pro.


Surprise announcements


Let's have a live chat event and find out together! :)


Time of Keynote address

The Keynote address is scheduled for 10am on Monday 5 June (Pacific Time). This equates to:


Adelaide - 2.30am, Tuesday 6 June
Amsterdam - 7.00pm, Monday 5 June
Auckland - 5.00am, Tuesday 6 June
Beijing - 1.00am, Tuesday 6 June
Berlin - 7.00pm, Monday 5 June
Hong Kong - 1.00am, Tuesday 6 June

We currently have a a whole bunch of things mixed into the custom close reasons


Questions about software development
Basic customer support questions (where the question should first go to the vendor, as described in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2508/why-were-not-customer-support-for-company-x-or-product-yWhy we're not customer support for [company X or product Y] 
Recommend or find stuff (aka "please google for me")
Questions which don't show any research done, are basically "write this script for me" and similar (which often are hard to distinguish from "unclear what you are asking" or "too broad" type of question)


This basically means that we have four different (but not totally unrelated) things squeezed into three close reasons. Which obviously doesn't work out so well sometimes.

One way forward would be to rely more on the fact that we already have meta posts explaining the reasoning behind the basic customer support and the recommendation close reason and use this to keep the close reason to the point. So we could go with


Questions must demonstrate a reasonable amount of research & understanding of the problem being solved. Please edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it, including attempted solutions, why they didn't work, and the expected results.

We may need to have an AD-specific version of the recommendation meta-post for this, but that's something we can tackle if we agree on going with these three reasons.

A few days ago I asked "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287161/how-can-i-turn-off-siris-joke-responsesHow can I turn off Siri's joke responses?"

I thought this was a perfectly legitimate question. It's on-topic, not subjective, and (I think) pretty clear what I'm asking. It's not intended as a complaint or an invitation to discussion, just a simple "how do I do this" question. I understand that the answer may be "you can't currently" or "nobody knows", although I hope it's not.

My question received several helpful comments and a possible answer. The score is currently -2, which means at least two people thought it was a bad question. Obviously no one but them knows why they voted, but I'm pretty surprised by this. I thought it was a decent question. Is there something obviously wrong that I'm missing? Or if not, is there anything I could change to make this question acceptable?

I've had a look at the question and, to be honest, don't see any major problems with it. 

Obviously there's no way to know what the users who downvoted you were thinking, but I had a look and see they were all before you changed the title, so who knows if that played a role. 

In this case it may be best to move on and forget it. For what it's worth, I don't get the joke responses you get when I use Siri to set a timer, so that in itself makes the question valid in my opinion.

Not sure this is the right place to ask this (where else?).
I'm doing some research on iPhone software and hardware and have learnt some stuff that I couldn't find anywhere else.  I thought I'd like to share this information with the general public. 

Is there any website where anyone can publish their articles?.  I've been looking at some such as Techradar, appleinsider, etc. and they seem to just have their own tech people for that.

There is some talk about the possibility of a blog getting started again for AD, but for now you could start your own blog.


















You see the question which was put on hold by another moderator (not with 5 votes of community). But you think that this question is good and should not be closed. What will you do?

I would suggest refraining from any sort of manual cleanup on this. The system cleanup is scripted and unless you are in making a substantive edit and happen to fix http / https you are causing human review effort for something that can / should be automated.

George's answers @grgarside


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


No one is exempt from https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/be-nicebeing nice. Thankfully, inappropriate behaviour is something rarely seen here (separate from spam, which is something https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/35637558Ask Different suffers heavily from), let alone from someone with an otherwise good contribution history.

However, should it come to it, I would attempt to work with them, letting them know some of their contributions are not being well-received, ensuring their future contributions adhere to the code of conduct. Hopefully this will have the desired effect, but if not, a suspension is a likely course of action. One hopes this won’t often be necessary.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


As with anyone, I would raise it with the person who performed the action. There can be more to something than initially appears, or I’ve missed something in the way I’ve viewed the issue. Either way, this has always solved such discrepancies in the past and I would continue in this manner.


  
  As a moderator, your votes become binding. Actions you used to take like flagging, closing, and deleting will take effect immediately without any input from any other users or moderators.
  
  How will you adapt the way you currently flag and vote to deal with this change?
  


I am familiar with binding votes through my two gold tag badges in the most popular tags on the site and the ability this provides to close questions as duplicate. Furthermore, I strive to be as accurate as possible with my flags in general; I have a 99% post flag accuracy on 3k flags and I encourage anyone to raise with me any queries regarding the actions I take at any time.


  
  In addition to moderation activities (e.g. dealing with flagged posts, deleting spam, etc), what other role do you see that moderators can play to improve the overall success of our community?
  


Moderators are still normal people in the community. The moderators on this site are extremely knowledgeable on Apple topics and contribute greatly to providing answers, directly helping people who come to the site looking for help with their issue. I look to continue providing answers to your Apple questions, assisting in the core principle of the site: Q&A.


  
  As a user of this site, what would you say is the number one issue we face moving forward? And, do you have any thoughts on how we tackle that issue?
  


Tags. The tagging system is a reasonable way to find questions in a certain category, but at the moment it’s not an excellent way. Inappropriate use of tags is one thing and is regularly fixed through editing, but there are plenty of other structural tag issues, many of which lead to the incorrect tagging. I regularly https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=user%3a37797%20%5btags%5d%20is%3aquestionraise issues with tags on meta, but understandably there doesn’t seem to be much priority placed on them, exemplified by the regular automatic freezing of the tag chat room due to inactivity. The existing tools for dealing with this are unused by the majority: there’s barely a single tag synonym vote, let alone a synonym which went through without mod intervention. Yet despite this, tags are used by a large number of people to track and subscribe to various topics, so I think more could be done with improving how tags are organised on the site with proper synonyms and tag wiki.


  
  Since being a moderator requires you to commit a significant amount of your time, as well as having to perform a number of mundane activities, I am wondering why you've nominated for this role? What is it you feel you have to offer that makes you worthy of our trust?
  


Ask Different is an amazing community, I’ve learned so much over the years and enjoy repaying this where I can by contributing my knowledge; problem solving is very rewarding. Part of that transcends to moderation duties including reviewing and flagging — helping make things in order is rewarding in itself, especially when that helps as many people as a site like Ask Different does on a daily basis.

As for the trust aspect of this question, it might be a British thing but if someone says ‘trust me’, you probably shouldn’t. I’d like to suggest https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/37797/grgarside?tab=profilemy actions speak for themselves on this.


  
  If there is one thing you could/would like to change in the way the site is moderated, what would it be?
  


The moderators, past and present, have done a wonderful job of keeping the site in order for many years. I am extremely grateful of the work the moderator team has done, both behind the scenes and in their contributions to Q&A, both of which lead me like many others to discover this site and what it has to offer. A very minor point I could raise for this question would be that, in more recent years, there are occasional lapses in the level of communication over meta posts on topics brought up by the community. I’m sure with the addition of moderators from this election, in an effort to continue the excellent work of those departed over the years, will bring a temperate faster pace.


  
  A question is asked and receives some very good answers. The asker then flags this question and asks for it to be deleted because having it up will cause them trouble at work or school. Do you delete the question?
  


I do not delete the question, as there are generally other ways of dealing with such a problem. Since the contribution was licensed under Creative Commons, Stack Exchange does not need to remove the post.


The question can be edited to remove information which is causing the issue and which is only secondary to the problem. This would mean the question could remain without causing problems due to the extraneous information provided.
Editing can also be used to replace proprietary details with other information which still demonstrates or explains the problem appropriately, but does not infringe on the content causing issue.
Depending on the situation, post disassociation may be suitable if the issue is with the link back to the particular person or their subsequent links elsewhere. This removes the ties between the person and the content causing issue.
A recent moderator ability is revision redaction (previously requiring CM intervention). This is useful for cleaning up a post where an edit resolves the problem but the revision history retains the issue.



  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


I always do my upmost to be respectful and appropriate with my contributions, for posts as well as other media such as comments or chat. As such I have no problem with any of my past actions on the site and aim to continue that in the future.


  
  How would you handle situations involving less than warm welcomes given to new users?
  
  For example, a new user posts a well written first question consisting of a clearly defined problem statement, admission of a high level of domain ignorance, and a request for the proper solution methodology, but no actual attempts to tackle the problem.
  
  Said question receives many downvotes and impolite comments. The asker gets upset about the situation and complains to you directly on chat and/or meta.
  
  What would you do?
  


Driving users away from a site is something everyone wants to avoid as much as possible. Situations like the one given in the question make users feel frustrated and encourage them to pursue other options. I would remove inappropriate comments from the post and work with the person to refine their question. Chat is a good place for this and in my opinion is under-utilised on Ask Different for helping people with such issues. There is a difference between someone not knowing how to start with a question despite much research, and someone unwilling to put in the effort in the first place to try — chat is a good way to provide pointers in the right direction either way, such that the question and therefore the problem can be rectified.

https://stackexchange.com/users/5474807




  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


My first point of call would be to touch base with our existing moderators. I’d want to know what precedent has been established for this type of scenario. I’d be surprised if there isn’t one, but if that were the case I’d still assume the moderators were already aware of this particular user, so I’d want to try and reach consensus with them first on the way forward.

However, if I was the only moderator available, my approach would be to invite the user to a private chat and try to build some sort of rapport with them. I’d be sure to start on a positive note (such as commending them on the time they spend formulating such good quality answers). Then, when bringing up the issue at hand, I’d want to give them the opportunity to express their thoughts on what was going on, and give them the chance to suggest a way forward. Basically, I’d try to find some sort of common ground so that we could avoid a suspension.

Either way, after a bit of an uncomfortable conversation such as this, I’d want to finish off on a more positive note. I’d be sure to remind them just how valued their answers are and how much we appreciate their efforts. My hope would be that this approach will achieve a win-win situation for the community as a whole.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


I’ve always been a team player and get along with most people, so I would just ask them about it. This way we’d quickly establish what their reasoning was and, if I had an alternative view, I’d be able to express that as well. If an error was made I’m sure the other mod would change it themselves. In the end, I think we’d generally reach a consensus one way or the other. 


  
  As a moderator, your votes become binding. Actions you used to take like flagging, closing, and deleting will take effect immediately without any input from any other users or moderators.
  
  How will you adapt the way you currently flag and vote to deal with this change?
  


I always try to take a Stop-Think-Do approach to most things, so I don’t think I’ll need to adapt how I currently flag and vote. In fact, 99% of all my flags have been rated as helpful by the existing mods. I’m happy with that and hope to continue that standard regardless of whether I'm elected as a moderator.


  
  In addition to moderation activities (e.g. dealing with flagged posts, deleting spam, etc), what other role do you see that moderators can play to improve the overall success of our community?
  


My view is that the number 1 thing moderators can do is to lead by example.

Some ways of doing this are easy to measure (e.g. answering questions, dealing with flags, deleting spam, editing posts, and so on).

Other ways are not so obvious. 

For example, I think moderators have a role to play trying to calm things down if they come across a heated debate in comments (e.g. posting a comment like I think it’s great you’re all so passionate, but can we please agree to focus on the specifics of the question rather than getting bogged down in a debate about…). 

This type of thing is hard to measure, but it's definitely a role that moderators can play.


  
  As a user of this site, what would you say is the number one issue we face moving forward? And, do you have any thoughts on how we tackle that issue?
  


George (@grgarside) has already raised the issue of tags and I tend to agree as I find myself regularly changing the tags used on questions. So I like what George has to say about this and would support his approach.

However, for me the number one issue is improving engagement between users and the site. I'll try and explain what I’m getting at:

Since its launch, Ask Different has had over 164,000 registered users. Of these, only 0.024% of them have ever reached a reputation score of 200. Using the last 30 days as an example, we’ve had 2,930 new registrations in that time. Of these, 2,540 (86.7%) were totally new to the Stack Exchange network. Unfortunately, only 180 (that’s 0.07%) of these now have a reputation above 1.

Now, how is this the case? Is it just that the site has an issue of low voting? Or, is it because the overwhelming majority of new users don’t ask and/or answer questions? 

For me, the only way to tackle this type of thing is to measure it. I believe if we can measure it, we can improve it. So if I’m elected as a moderator one of my side projects would be to really start measuring/analysing site usage and trying to work back from there. If it’s clear that we need to encourage voting, then we’d try to find ways to educate users on how important voting is. If it’s something else, then we tackle that. 

This is just one issue (e.g. about one-third of the site's questions - that's over 26,000 - remain unanswered, likewise many questions/answers have no votes whatsoever, and so on).

The point is, unless we do the analysis to begin with, how will we ever know? 


  
  Since being a moderator requires you to commit a significant amount of your time, as well as having to perform a number of mundane activities, I am wondering why you've nominated for this role? What is it you feel you have to offer that makes you worthy of our trust?
  


I’ve just checked and I’ve been active on the site for 444 days, and I’ve actually visited the site for the last 300 consecutive days. So I guess I’m already investing a fair bit of my time here. 

If I’m elected, it’ll probably be more about how I reprioritise that time. In terms of mundane activities, well, I’ve already been doing most of these types of things anyway (reviews, edits, flagging, etc), as I’m sure many other users can relate to as well.

So I’m putting myself forward because I feel I can contribute to the success and growth of the site. For example:


I have an analytical mind and like measuring things to see how we can do them better. As a user I’ve already started thinking about the site and how it’s being used. 
I’m already contemplating ways to improve engagement. For examples, see these meta posts: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3041/168832WWDC Keynote Live Chat Event  and https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3036/168832Ask Different Blog.


So, why am I worthy of your trust?

For starters, this is not a power grab for me. I hadn't considered nominating for a moderator until recently when one of the current moderators mentioned they hoped I’d volunteer. So for me, being a moderator isn’t something I've been working towards for any sort of personal gain, or just as part of some sort of ego trip - it's really more a calling to serve.

Along with many of you, I have dedicated a lot of time to making this site the wonderful resource it is. Anyone here can go back and read the entire history of my https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=answersanswers and/or https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=activity&sort=commentscomments and see for themselves that I’ve always tried to help users, and I’m not shy to encourage them. I’m also a prolific voter of both questions and answers, regardless of whether the user was above or below me in the ranks. 

Other examples of me putting the site first include my volunteering to:


allow https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291301/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically?cb=1Smoke Detector to use my account to flag spam automatically
be part of the https://crowdcrafting.org/project/sehttpimagescleanup/crowdcrafting effort to cleanup Stack Exchange’s HTTP images.


While the above doesn’t necessarily prove I’m worthy of your trust, it does show my motivations have been to put the site first.


  
  If there is one thing you could/would like to change in the way the site is moderated, what would it be?
  


The current moderators do a fantastic job. So much so that when this election was called, my first reaction was to jump straight into Chat and ask why we were having an election. That’s because things generally run very well.

However, there are two things that could be improved:


Having more time to manage meta posts, as some of these do require a bit of follow-up work. Sometimes these are followed up pretty quickly, and other times they’re left sitting there with no real resolution. I do not blame the current moderators for this, I genuinely believe this is just a consequence of the fact we’ve only had https://apple.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsfour moderators for quite a while now. By way of comparison, the https://mathoverflow.net/users?tab=moderatorsMathOverflow site basically has the same number of questions and answers as we do, but has seven active moderators.
Having a moderator presence on a 24/7 basis whenever possible. At present we have four moderators, three based in the US and one in Europe. As someone who lives in Australia, I regularly find there’s a bit of a gap in terms of coverage. This isn’t usually a problem as we all have a role to play in moderation, but if we had some more time zones covered it can only be a good thing.


The first point, and maybe even the second, will be rectified simply by having these elections.


  
  A question is asked and receives some very good answers. The asker then flags this question and asks for it to be deleted because having it up will cause them trouble at work or school. Do you delete the question?
  


The short answer is no, especially since users have gone to the trouble to provide some very good answers. Instead, I’d invite the OP into chat and ask them what specifically could create problems for them. This allows us to address the issue. For example, the question itself can be edited to remove any offending elements. Likewise, the OP’s profile can be edited to remove any identifying information. Regardless, I’m sure we’d be able to find a resolution that didn’t require the need to delete the question.


  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


I’d feel no different to how I do now.

As I mentioned previously, anyone can go back and read the entire history of my https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=answersanswers,  https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=activity&sort=commentscomments etc, and see for themselves that I’ve always conducted myself appropriately. I basically aim to always help users whenever possible, so having a diamond next to my name isn’t going to change that.


  
  How would you handle situations involving less than warm welcomes given to new users?
  
  For example, a new user posts a well written first question consisting of a clearly defined problem statement, admission of a high level of domain ignorance, and a request for the proper solution methodology, but no actual attempts to tackle the problem.
  
  Said question receives many downvotes and impolite comments. The asker gets upset about the situation and complains to you directly on chat and/or meta.
  
  What would you do?
  


Firstly I’d review the question and comments. Any inappropriate comments would be deleted and I’d apologise on behalf of the community for any offence caused. 
Finally, I would try to help the user to reformulate their question so we could get things back on track.

Here are my (https://apple.stackexchange.com/election/4#post-288564Glorfindel's) answers to your questions:




  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


/help/be-niceBe Nice is very important to the success of Stack Exchange; more important than posting good answers (or questions, for that matter). I'd remind this user (in a polite but strict way) to change their behaviour or face the consequences in the form of a suspension. There are enough other users who can write those valuable answers instead.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


I'd discuss this with them in a private chatroom. I might bring in a third (or fourth) moderator as well if I feel we need to make a tough decision, so that it can be a decision of a majority. There's no need doing this in public and risk harming the trust the community has in the moderator team.


  
  As a moderator, your votes become binding. Actions you used to take like flagging, closing, and deleting will take effect immediately without any input from any other users or moderators.
  
  How will you adapt the way you currently flag and vote to deal with this change?
  


From what I've seen, the community already does a decent job of moderating this site. My job as a moderator would be mainly to guide that, and not make unilateral decisions, unless strictly necessary. A ♦ moderator is a representative of the community, not a ruler; if the community thinks something is worth keeping (open), I'm willing to forego my personal opinions. I'd probably end up Skipping more reviews than I usually do.


  
  In addition to moderation activities (e.g. dealing with flagged posts, deleting spam, etc), what other role do you see that moderators can play to improve the overall success of our community?
  


The following isn't limited to moderators; it concerns all users. But I believe moderators should lead by example:


Increase participation


This starts with welcoming other users, so that they're more likely to stick around.
"Being nice" helps tremendously in the long run.
I'm not necessarily trying to draw people away from Super User, but I see a lot of Mac questions there that would fit here perfectly.
I like the idea of organizing chat events around Apple's keynotes. I'm sorry I wasn't around the previous time this happened.

Represent the interests of Ask Different across the network. (I can't think of something specific right now, to be honest.)
Sometimes, we spot certain trends (e.g. a sudden spike in the number of questions about a single topic). We should think of a solution (e.g. creating one or two canonical questions) and propose this on Meta, so that the community can chime in and decide.



  
  As a user of this site, what would you say is the number one issue we face moving forward? And, do you have any thoughts on how we tackle that issue?
  


We have a very low (69%) of https://stackexchange.com/sites#percentansweredquestions which are answered <-- you have to scroll down a bit, alas. For comparison: one of the (not always enforced) criteria for graduation of a beta site is that it must have an answered percentage of at least 80%. 90% or higher is considered healthy.

This can have two possible reasons: we have too many questions, or too few people able to answer those questions (or close them as a duplicate of a canonical question – closed questions don't count in that metric). If it's the first, we should focus on increasing the chance that a (new) user is able to solve his/her problem with the vast number of questions we already have. The second is probably harder, and would mean we probably need more knowledgeable people here.


  
  Since being a moderator requires you to commit a significant amount of your time, as well as having to perform a number of mundane activities, I am wondering why you've nominated for this role? What is it you feel you have to offer that makes you worthy of our trust?
  


As indicated in my https://apple.stackexchange.com/election/4#post-288564nomination, I love moderating. I have been doing a lot of mundane tasks behind the scenes; not being in the spotlight works right for 95% of the time. For the other 5%, it's useful to have a ♦ behind your name. I'm offering to work hard, just as I've done in the past.


  
  If there is one thing you could/would like to change in the way the site is moderated, what would it be?
  


I don't think major changes are needed. Sometimes, my Not-An-Answer flags on "I'm having the same problem, did you solve it?" take quite long to be processed, but I guess the election will take care of this, by increasing the number of moderators and the hours that they are available. (And to be honest, those posts are annoying but not really harmful.)

I mentioned some areas in need of attention under point 4, but those do not really fall under moderation, and are shared responsibilities between the ♦ moderators and other community members.


  
  A question is asked and receives some very good answers. The asker then flags this question and asks for it to be deleted because having it up will cause them trouble at work or school. Do you delete the question?
  


No. By signing up and posting content on Stack Exchange, the user has granted a non-revocable right, under the https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/CC BY-SA 3.0 license, for SE to distribute that content. I'd explain that to the user (licenses can be tricky material) and ask them to submit a disassociation request via the contact us form (that can only be performed by Stack Overflow staff, not by ♦s). This will keep the valuable content but remove the association with the user. In addition, if the post contains Personally Identifiable Information, I'll redact it if necessary (so that it doesn't end up in the revision history).


  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


Yes. I always try to Be Nice to all people, even if I think they have bad ideas or opinions which I can outright refute. Respect is the keyword for building a community where everybody is welcome. I have certainly made some mistakes in the past, but that only proves I'm human and https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/11540?m=38051363#38051363not an AI.


  
  How would you handle situations involving less than warm welcomes given to new users?
  
  For example, a new user posts a well written first question consisting of a clearly defined problem statement, admission of a high level of domain ignorance, and a request for the proper solution methodology, but no actual attempts to tackle the problem.
  
  Said question receives many downvotes and impolite comments. The asker gets upset about the situation and complains to you directly on chat and/or meta.
  
  What would you do?
  


"This question does not show any research effort" is a good reason to downvote a question (it's on the downvote tooltip), and I support the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3030/121968No Research close reason (which would put the question on hold so that it can be improved – many people forget about that). I'd try to make clear (in a respectful manner) to the user why we don't allow/like these types of questions on Stack Exchange, and discuss together how to improve his/her question (e.g. by suggesting some avenues to explore). Chat is a perfect medium for that because it's interactive.

Impolite comments can always be flagged and, if necessary, reposted (with attribution) keeping the constructive bits.

One thing we don’t have a large group doing is making “canonical” questions. I think since Ask Different is primarily a consumer focused site - well over half the questions are basic troubleshooting / triage. If the higher rep users came together and strategically got the canonical answers set - closing a higher proportion of answers as dupe of solid questions with even more solid answers would get that percentage up in a healthy and sustainable manner.


















Found the answer after a couple of minutes...

This issue was caused by the following TamperMonkey script: https://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Featureshttps://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Features

Disabling this in TamperMonkey made the site work again. The version in question is 1.8DEV, which seems to be the latest version.

I've disabled this script now and everything is working again.

Perhaps the JavaScript is being blocked - either intentionally by Apple in the new features to prevent cookies from domains that do not get visited explicitly and/or by content blocking rules.


















The places to learn more about mod candidates are the Q&A here on Meta and the Election chat room where all the candidates answer questions thrown at them. 

Please keep in mind that the site is primarily community moderated, so the individual voting pattern of mods isn't very important. Even their casting of close votes isn't as important nowadays, there are enough highrep users to close (or not close) a lot of questions without a mod joining in. Which is how it should be, actually. 

More important is their ability to step in in situations where the community can't resolve an issue on its own and/or where emotions start to take over. Also, even mods don't work in isolation but as Part of a team which supports decision making by mods and sometimes also discusses individual mod behavior (in case things go severely wrong). 

PS: Not even moderators can see up/down votes of other users when locking at a specific question/answer. We can see the "All Actions" tab for all users but honestly I had to verify this first because there just never was the need to look.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks. If we can't see up/down voting history, then we have no idea how they manage good on-topic questions and off-topic garbage. And we can't judge their judgement and discretion. And if they almost never down-vote, then that indicates to me they try to please too much and confrontation may be a problem. Its not like I'm asking for anything obscene. In the real world, we know political candidate voting history. That's pretty much all we have to go on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are good reasons for not showing the voting history of anybody and there are good reasons for showing it. I'm sure that the discussion has come up on meta.stackexchange.com already at least once.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I thought the topic would have been discussed before, but... [moderator election "show profile" site:meta.stackexchange.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=moderator+election+"show+profile"+site%3Ameta.stackexchange.com). I don't agree with any reasons for not showing it for someone seeking a Moderator position. Moderators should be judged for fitness of the role; and we should not have to depend on doubletalk in the chat rooms. Sunlight is still the best disinfectant. Access to history ensures transparency.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you really want mods who downvote a lot? Or do you want to have mods who (if they see a low quality question) either coach the poster in improving the text or edit the text themself to remove the reason for downvoting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jww For your reference, you can see how much up- and downvotes users have cast. I will copy them here. Format upvotes on main / downvotes on main / upvotes on meta / downvotes on meta. grgarside: 7218 / 3015 / 359 / 60. Monomeeth: 2373 / 8 / 127 / 1.

The good news is that the site is designed to have a large number of unanswered / orphaned / closed but not deleted questions and they only serve to index issues and eventually point to the most on-topic and best answered post covering the main issue.

Whether a post is 5 days old or 5 years old - it can always be edited to make it more clear or more relevant or in some cases - more general.

Comments can always be left to help clarify what the issue is in case that brings back the poster. Unless someone makes votes or posts in answer - questions get cleaned up automatically over time if they never generate any interest.

As to old questions - as long as they are tagged appropriately with versions instead of saying “the latest iPhoto” old posts will help people that don’t want to upgrade or can’t upgrade.


This one isn’t that bad and someone could come and answer a “here’s how to troubleshoot VPN in general and here are links to more articles.” - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/186330/unable-to-connect-to-a-server-over-vpnUnable to connect to a server over VPN The other is just fine since it calls out iOS 6 and you’re right - even with potential benefit - chances are they may sit in the back waters of the site forever without an answer.


Lastly - you are free to exercise your franchise and down vote them for reasons above. At some point they get cleared out when they are 0 or less score and untouched for a while. A single vote might be all that’s needed to clear them even without close votes.

Part of the lesson I suppose, how to clean up orphaned questions is to down vote them and/or not up vot them. The system cleans them systematically if no one tends to them or cares for them.

Yes, there are already a lot of questions on meta about prerelease software, but I don’t think any of them actually focus on Public Betas. 

Sure, in the past, people would illegally download developer ipsw files to get ios betas on their phones. But now, since it is easy and legal to download the iOS 11 beta (I’m running it right now), we are seeing more and more questions crop up about iOS betas that do not apply to a vast majority of users on this forum, like https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/290556/191432Will Siri in iOS 11 support Spotify?

What should we do about these questions?

I didn't realize that there ever was a "beta ban" but did notice an uptick in 'how do I solve this beta-specific issue' questions.


















Similar to https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2433/217210this situation, I've had 7 recent comment flags declined on noisy comments.

These comments are just of the '+1' or 'Thanks' type:


  Huge "THANKS!". :)





  +100 to apachectl configtest





  +10 for "Scrollen und Zoomen"


When you go to post a comment, you see this:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/rh88N.png


  Use comments to ask for more information or suggest improvements. Avoid comments like "+1" or "thanks". (emphasis mine)


And https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/15292/294691Jeff Atwood said to flag these.

So... why did I have these flags declined? I know that 9 declined flags out of 521 total isn't bad, but still... why were they declined?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why were these too chatty flags declined on some +1 comments?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just because Jeff Atwood says something doesn't mean we all agree :-/


















I'm the 'culprit', so to speak, for declining the three comments you're asking about. 

In summary:

The Huge "THANKS!". :) comment should have been deleted (I think that was a case of me hitting the wrong option). My apologies for that one.

As for the other two, for me they were 50/50 and I could have gone either way. The reasons I opted to leave them were as follows:


The community had upvoted these comments (one has 6, the other 5) which is relatively high, so for me this was an indication they were valued in some way.
They added a sense of confirmation that the answer (or something in the answer) was useful/correct.
They're relatively old (one is over 4 yrs old), so there was probably nothing to gain by deleting them.


Now, if the comments were posted today, I would have:


deleted the +10 for "Scrollen und Zoomen" comment as it wouldn't have had the votes and doesn't really add anything significant to the answer.
left the +100 to apachectl configtest comment alone on the basis that many users are 'nervous' when it comes to using Terminal, so for those users this comment adds some weight to what was suggested in the answer. 


Finally, it's quite possible (even probable) that I was over thinking all of this since it was my first day as a Mod, so I'll be checking with the others on their view of this as well. I appreciate you taking the time to ask the question in meta and sincerely hope this doesn't discourage you from flagging posts in future.

Right on cue - a long discussion on how the “too chatty” standard was loose and unhelpful - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/292011/drop-not-constructive-combine-noisy-reword-rude-and-other-comment-flagwe’ve done away with that flag across all sites effective immediately.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/GxUfW.png

The problem

Comments are terrible; no one agrees on what they're for, or how long they should be kept. Comment flags are equally terrible, because if no one's on the same page as far as what should be posted in the first place then no one can agree on what should be removed either. On top of that, we have this confusing set of flags where two mean "noise", one means "vile", one means "moderator, help!" and one means nothing at all - the end result is that it's all but impossible to even analyze comment flagging.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And the other difficult thing about comments is that we can't always look at them in isolation (except of course for the 'rude or abusive' ones). What I mean is a comment may be too chatty etc, but then deleting it could remove some of the context surrounding the other comments. It certainly doesn't make our job easier.


















Now and then I find something here that is very, very helpful, and I want to thank the person who posted it, by commenting in some apposite phrases. But I can't. I need 50 'reputation' points. 

I really haven't time to contribute to that extent, so a lot of people here are missing out on kudos. I don't wish merely to click-and-upvote, I don't experience sufficient problems to be seeking all the time for assistance. Besides, click-vote is too easy, too impersonal. Just one of the many reasons I long ago deleted my Facebook account was the culture of the inane 'Like' button. It doesn't demand any thought of the button clicker (Why do you like it? Give reasons for your approval) and is part of the widespread dumbing-down trend.

So, to all the brilliant, non-dumbing people here, who take and have taken the trouble to share their knowledge, and break Gordian knots for those of us in toils, please share this 'thank you' among yourselves. I'm afraid it's the only one I am currently allowed to give you.

"**Use comments to ask for more information or suggested improvements. Avoid comments like "+1" or "thanks".**" So please say your thanks by up-voting, not comments.

The OP isn't asking 'how' to thank someone or make a site change to allow more/different ways to thank someone, he's simply saying 'thanks for helping people'.  In addition, he's aware of the site requirements for adding comments so he's already read the Help Center (which, apparently, is more than most people do).  I mean, it's nice and all, but it's still off-topic and should be closed (as I voted).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb "Meta Ask Different is the part of the site where users discuss the workings and policies of Ask Different" (from https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-meta), asking how to thank people fits the bill quite nicely. In general practically *anything" related to topics on how the site works is on-topic on Meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Totally agree that if the OP was asking **how** to thank people it would be on-topic.  However, he's not doing that, he's simply saying 'thanks for your help because I don't have 50 rep' (paraphrase, obviously).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb The rules are *very* relaxed on Meta.

I was doing a little bit of poking around today and realized that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/waterproofwaterproof is a synonym for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/environmentenvironment. Seems correct, right? Well, let's take a look at the description of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/environmentenvironment.


  Environment variables are used to create shared settings that persist between invocations of applications. They are used to provide information such as paths to important directories, user information and other information programs need for common tasks.


Now that doesn't seem right, does it.

I propose that we remove the tag synonym waterproof from https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/environmentenvironment

Great question - it's raising the tag curation thinking for the site - we'll do well to get all the high rep users and moderators on the same page how to work out when to synonimize, when to merge and when to maintain tags due to them being mis-applied or mis used in general.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also - we'll want a chat room to bang out some ideas that are too rough for an actual post or even comments.. https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/38873057#38873057b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You should include [waterproof] in the question title to make it clear which tag is being discussed.


















You say "thank you" on the Stack Exchange network by giving their answer or question an "up vote". It's that simple.
From https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/126184/151364this meta discussion on whether comments to say "thank you" are appropriate: that's not really what comments are for. They're for:

When should I comment?
You should submit a comment if you want to:

Request clarification from the author;
Leave constructive criticism that guides the author in improving the post;
Add relevant but minor or transient information to a post (e.g. a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).

When shouldn't I comment?

Compliments which do not add new information ("+1, great answer!"); instead, up-vote it and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-answerpay it forward;

We have a tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/environmentalenvironmental which is a better match for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/waterproofwaterproof, but it's already https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/temperature/synonymssynonymized to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/temperaturetemperature. Given that tag's excerpt:


  Using Apple products in wet, dry, hot, low- or high-pressure environments.


it's probably better to reverse that synonym direction, and a good deal of the questions are actually about Apple devices themselves having a high temperature. So that's worth having another look on.

For now, I have removed the synonym and renamed https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/environmentenvironment to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/environment-variablesenvironment-variables to avoid confusion in the future. I retagged a dozen or so questions where the tag no longer made sense, e.g. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103056/retina-macbook-pro-15-overheatingthis one, but I could have missed some of them. My apologies for the (minor) flooding of the homepage.

I'm thinking if we want to make environment variable a synonym of command line and expand that blurb to explain command line is for shells, scripting, environment variables and get rid of that tag entirely. What expert in environment variables wouldn't also be an expert in command line? Having both tags separate seems to dilute the system and not help identify leading users with that knowledge set.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike that's a good idea, but (because of Jackson's request and my cleanup actions) it now only requires a tag merge from [environment-variables] into [command-line]. So it's not necessarily *the other direction* :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - I meant the other direction than what I think Jackson was asking - not the other direction of your actions. But I also need to sit down and think this out - I'll often write a bit and then need to diagram and then make sure my initial thoughts make sense. This is one where I'm on the "step A" but I'd like others to help on what the options are other than me going off to analyze / solve in one step.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All right. I think it's something @grgarside mentioned in his answers to the election questionnaire, and it's a project I'm looking forward to tackling once we (the new mods) have decent experience with our new tools.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, tags are an area I hope to work on soon — along with the existing proposals I asked a while back, I have a few more points to raise with the community about tags, which I look to bring up once I’m certain with my ideas for a way forward. Your answer is a prime example of why tags need attention: the question on its own is reasonable, asking for a synonym removal, yet there is plenty more context which needs to be taken into consideration such as how the tags are being used at the moment.


















I've seen my fair share of 'shady' per-se questions on here, and am looking for input on where we draw the line. 

There are several places that we could draw this metaphorical line:


Jailbreak related questions (violates Apple EULA) like this:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/288157/cydia-unable-to-load-server-certificate-invalidCydia Unable to Load (server certificate invalid)
Hackintoshes (violates Apple EULA, potentially DMCA?) like this:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/118014/hackintosh-vmware-amd-7950-chipsetHackintosh / VMWare AMD 7950 Chipset
Piracy related questions (violates Apple, StackExchange EULA, is actually illegal) like this:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/292762/quicktime-player-wont-record-iphone-hotstar-or-amazon-prime-videos-any-moreQuickTime Player won't record iPhone Hotstar or Amazon Prime videos any more


What should we allow? It can be using one of these points, or even something in between. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where do we draw the legal line?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One thing to remember even for those of us not lawyers - Illegal contains three elements: 1) Jurisdiction - where in the world is the action being done 2) Action as opposed to talking about or explaining how things work 3) Judge to balance many laws and contracts to come up with case law which often is different than regulatory or statuatory law. (i.e. EULA may not even be a contract in many jurisdictions) +1 for raising the issue so we all can ponder what being a worldwide source of knowledge means in terms of process here for guiding our FAQb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike These are all excellent points! A perfect example (albeit a totally random thought on my behalf), is a debate that raged in Australia in the 1990s around drug law reform. Actions such as smoking marijuana was both illegal *and* a criminal offence, and yet it was perfectly legal to sell and/or own the paraphernalia used to smoke marijuana. And, if you were caught in possession of the drug, you could be charged even if there was no evidence that you actually smoked it, but being in possession of goods that served no other purpose but to smoke it, was perfectly fine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Coming back to more *on topic* examples, many questions here about setting up and using VPNs (some of which I've answered), are probably really about circumventing geolocation barriers so that users can watch Netflix etc in other regions, but we'd never disallow these questions as VPNs are both perfectly legal, and serve fully legitimate purposes as well. There's no doubting that this is a very relevant issue to ponder, and your reminder that AD is a worldwide resource is certainly worth consideration.


















I believe that we should allow jailbreak related questions. There's a big enough community - and as long as they aren't questions like When will an iOS 11.0.4 jailbreak come out they are fine. Might as well add in a jailbreak tag. Oh, wait - we already have one: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jailbreakjailbreak
I also believe that we should disallow hackintosh questions. Since these are already going to be highly technical, they may confuse some of the newcomers, and can also detract from the community. They will be asking about non-apple parts, and that can get a little messy. Also, the hackintosh community's a little too small for this right now.
Finally, I think we should disallow questions about piracy because that's straight-up illegal, and we're actually forbidden from posting about it on StackExchange, from what I've determined from the /legalToS and /legal/content-policycontent policy
Summary:
Should we allow...

Jailbreak: YES
Hackintosh: NO
Piracy: NO

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[The Hackintosh debate](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/23/292) was settled long ago and we allow the questions. [The jailbreak debate](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/492/asking-jailbreak-related-question) was also settled and for the most part we allow the questions. Copyright laws vary wildly from country-to-country so what is and isn't a copyright violation is difficult to determine canonically. Ergo, your example for "piracy" would also stand as a legitimate question on the site (Beta-Max anyone?).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. Just so you know, the help center is out of date for the Hackintosh questions - it says we do not allow questions about installing apple software on non apple hardwareb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to say I can see both the arguments for and against allowing *Hackintosh* questions. But as a moderator I have to say that all things considered, the site overall is better off without them. I think for most users they'd end up just adding a lot of *noise* to the site and would detract from the overall user experience (that is unless we restricted the use of tags somehow, but even then it's problematic). Not to mention that there are many excellent online resources for users who want to build a Hackintosh.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In terms of piracy, the question for me isn't so much about whether they should or shouldn't be permitted, it's moreso about how one makes the judgment as to when a question is or isn't actually about piracy? I'm comfortable with the idea of letting the community decide that with the power of their votes, remembering of course that anyone can reword a question to get it re-opened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jackson1442 we'll update the Help Center then!


















In general - comment flags for too chatty ar highly subjective. We don't have a large comment problem, so we're generally more lenient that large sites.

See https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3103/why-were-these-too-chatty-flags-declined-on-some-1-commentsWhy were these too chatty flags declined on some +1 comments? for some recent discussion on this.

If you want to list some specific flags or hop in a chat room - we can look at specifics. Just @ me here or in the chat. The problem with robot flagging all comments that match a pattern is that there's benefit on sites where the proportion of users are new to the SE model is that they help explain how voting and accepting answers work. 

If we were to take a strict "there shall be no chat, no thanks, no meta discussion in comments" my experience is that causes more harm than good, but I'm willing to look over some specifics.

we should have all the answers for all the versions in one question,
rather than a separate question for each version of macOS

In short, yes.
TL;DR
Apple changes things with each revision of their hardware and software;  some of it unintentional (aka ahem..."features") and lots intentional (aka "stuff that annoys users to the nth degree").
Simply stating that a question is for a different version and/or product doesn't negate it from still being current or relevant.
In the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/294986/is-there-a-faster-way-to-restart-macos-sierra-into-the-bootcamp-partitionquestion you originally asked, you state (via an edit):

The duplicate question how to quickly reboot from OSX to Windows and
back does have one answer that may work for macOS Sierra,

(emphasis mine)
The key element that would disqualify it from being a duplicate is if the solution presented didn't work; which would be more than significant enough a factor to not be flagged.

Looking at this from a purely logistical point of view, having the same question for each version of macOS would be rather large.  From Mavericks (10.9) to High Sierra shipping today (10.14), that's 5 different versions (not including the minor upgrades).
Why would we need 5 different questions/answers for the same thing if the question/answer are still relevant?
Going further, if the question is "different" because of the hardware being is is older further adds to number of permutations.    Just doing a cursory check the MBP goes back to 2006 and has about 20 major versions (i.e. Mid-2011) excluding the sizes (13", 15", 17") and options (i.e. Retina, TouchBar, etc.)
Would we need to have 100 different permutations of the same question/answer because the hardware/software combo is older/different?  I think it would be illogical and inefficient to have a separate question for each possibility even if limited to only the major releases of hardware/software.
Reopening Closed Questions
As this is community driven, we do make mistakes and close things for many reasons including marking questions as dupes when they are in fact not.  For instance, in https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/290765/how-do-i-get-os-x-10-11-6-to-return-my-free-spacethis question asked within the last 30 days, it was marked as a dupe but reopened because the OP added the following clarification:

This isn't the same question as the proposed duplicated, at all. I am
not suggesting that anything is eating my disk space. I'm also not
saying that restarting it changes anything. I'm stating that the disk
util says I have 300 GB free, which is likely the case given what I
deleted, and the OS says ~90 GB free, an amount that did not change as
I was deleting things and did not change when restarting the
system...so basically the freed space was not given back.

As is the case with your question.  It's entirely possible that your question isn't a duplicate, but until you rule out the solution(s) already provided for the previously asked question, it's a duplicate.
Updating the previously asked question
Being a community site, it's encouraged to edit questions/answers to make them more accurate (without trying to change the author's intent).  For example, if the previous question/answer was (not) a solution to your issue, you could edit the answer with a single line saying:

Update as of some date:  This is confirmed to (not) work in mac OS Sierra (10.13.x).

Asking a new question wouldn't be considered a dupe at that point and you would be contributing back to the community by keeping the original question relevant.
To address your comment:

So your suggestion is essentially to try every one of the many broken
answers in the dupe and then ask a new question if none of them work?

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askHelp Center addresses that concern:

Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your
question? Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found
and why it didn’t meet your needs. This demonstrates that you’ve taken
the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious
answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and relevant
answer!

If the answer is works or is broken, you can https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/why-voteup/down vote and even add comments (i.e. "This answer doesn't work for whatever reason")
The key is to reasonably attempt to research before generically stating a question is may not be relevant because it's perceived to be obsolete.

I’m not sure there’s a right approach for every question - but I’m a fan of linking and saying - This question here worked for 10.7 and below, but since XYZ changed on 10.12 I’m struggling to do this. - In that limited case where the asker has a great analysis - having two questions makes sense. If not - bounty and community voting efforts in chat to raise a 10.13 answer should be doable.


















The site encourages editing questions, comments and answers.
The site also encourages to vote, up or down on each of these entry types.
Maybe I do not understand this correctly but what happens in the following scenarios:

There is a simple answer. It may be bad or at least perceived as such. It gets down votes. Now this answer is edited, and hopefully improved. If there was a mistake that is now no longer there, whatever, the negative vote still stands. What was the point in editing it?

There is a simple question. It may be quite well received and some people give good answers to how they understand the question. Question and/or answer get up votes. Now the original poster of the question realises that he was misunderstood, edits the question and the answers given do not really address the newly formulated question. Or the new question would now not be perceived as so interesting or valuable as the previous version. The votes remain the same. What was the point in editing it, now in relation to the votes to no longer fitting answers?

Currently I do not see how this dynamic is addressed.

This was regarding old posts. But it is also applicable to very new entries:
It seems to me that many votes are cast quite quickly, because someone likes or dislikes an answer or a question she just read. 
My current impression: Quick voting is the first phase that accumulates votes fast but also dies down quickly. After the first votes the voting slows down considerably. 

This effect is contrary to how the system is explained to work. (Good content raises to the top bad sinks down.)

If the example is a really fresh entry then diligence requires you to refine this (possibly your own) entry, based on comments, suggestions, better insight. But this is currently problematic:


"Likes or dislikes" is purposely opinion based, I understand. But asking these opinion based questions is discouraged. Technical merit or correctness are not emphasised enough in this voting system. Wit and humour, grammatical prowess, or the lack of both, play a role here. So voting is very largely influenced by opinion. If opinion is mostly discouraged in questions and answers, the it should be minimised in voting.
If these votes are cast before a fresh and still dynamic Q&A is only half-way settled then the concerns raised above become even more important. These should self-correct automatically (through the system as designed). But they only do if they are still within the attention span of those involved so far. Seems that sometimes the individual attention span or how this site is used by the community aren't really catering to that. This demotivates participants and muffles the discussion.


So, ideas for improvement or feature requests are:


Differentiate in the temporal sense votes cast and edits thereafter. Or make an automated request to review votes if (substantial) editing took place. Or introduce a voting quarantine.
Enable more feedback that encourages editing, improving the existing content. If this site is not only about answering but also about learning, then the feedback has to be more direct. This feedback will likely improve the overall quality on its own.
Make it easier or explicitly possible to differentiate between likes and votes. The latter being based solely on technical correctness. (I understand that this might be either unwanted or even too late, given the content produced so far.)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Voting vs Editing, are they at Odds in the Current System?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for raising the issue - we can discuss here and put the feature request in to the main meta as you wish.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You raise some very valid points. At present, if you vote an answer up, then after a period of time has passed the system won't let you change your vote **unless** it has been edited. What doesn't happen though, is after any such edit, voters of that answer aren't pinged automatically to let them know that an edit has taken place. Hmm.


















The editing is mostly a way to avoid a large period of time where people would be inclined to down vote as opposed to remedy past impressions. Ideally, each edit would then ping the voters or come back and revisit their expression - but without that, there’s still the chance that everyone else will see the edited post and help right the down votes if the edit fixes whatever issues existed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fun fact- in Stack Overflow Extras, there is a builtin script that tells you when a question you downvote is edited.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike: "Ideally": that's why I tagged this a feature request. Further: you first line I understand as: choose to either downvote or improve. Does anybody do that? Editing old questions other people posed seems already strange at first, but editing really old answers becomes quite fruitless this way. Together with no-comment down-votes this is really detrimental. Currently I think editing dates and vote dates should somehow be displayed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good @LangLangC - we can keep this feature request here and the developers will see it. You can also see if this is requested on the main meta or request this be migrated if you want this feature to be implemented on all sites that share the common code base and functionality.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: *"Ideally, each edit would then ping the voters or come back and revisit their expression"*. This sounds like a good place to start. At least then users would have the option of reviewing their vote in case they'd like to change it. However, an automatic ping raises problems without some sort of check and balance in place. For example, any automated pings should happen only after a certain amount of time has passed since the edit (let's say an hour), otherwise we could get a lot of pings while the edits are still in the progress of being made.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, how do we deal with the issue of *who* made the edit? For example, if someone wants to *vandalise* an answer in some subtle way for some sort of revengeful purpose, they could do that in the hope of reducing votes. So, how do we deal with that? Do we require the OP of the question/answer to have to accept the edit prior to any automated pings going out? Or maybe a requirement for the OP to have to accept an edit if their post already has votes (or in the case of an answer, if it's been accepted)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jackson1442 Thanks for mentioning [Stack Overflow Extras](https://stackapps.com/q/6091), I hadn't come across this before. Have you installed it? How well does it work?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth it works fairly well actually, and it's just a chrome install. Just don't enable _everything_ because the page does load a little slower and some of the options don't work very well together.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/297071/apache-errors-on-macos-sierra?noredirect=1#comment375483_297071


















Sparked by the question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/297391/251859What is coreduetd?

This got criticised for being: "it’s also a canonical question for one we want to close as “too broad” and “too wiki” - we don’t want to encourage questions that lack a practical question to be solved and we certainly don’t want to write a “macOS system internals” book one chapter a time and one daemon a time. I’ll refrain from closing from now - but there are fundamental problems with doing this systematically"

Compared to other https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2418/251859canonical questions, like the whole section of

this policy seems to be in need of clarification.

Compared to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat is on topic here? the question in question is about Apple software, and not matching the section of "refrain from asking".

Compared to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"Don't ask" the question in question is "a practical, answerable question, based on actual problems", "I would like others to explain…".
It is not like "What are all those daemons doing under the hood", that would indeed be too broad for one question. 

And since actual official documentation on this and similar processes seems to be lacking, most of the points under "subjective questions" could also be applied.

The actual problems that will be solved by answering these kind of questions will be indirect but important: can one safely and reliably disable such daemons through the Apple way (GUI, defaults-write, launchctl, other command line tools provided by Apple), unofficial to unsupported means (like deleting essential files, using 3rd party programs), just blocking net access. Are there potential benefits or disadvantages, increased or decreased security, privacy implications.

Currently I think this is perfectly in scope, if the right balance is found.
For this balance (=no complete book about sys-internals)  I would suggest to define an "atomic level": "sub-atomic" would be that not every single file on a stock install shall have an entry, and "atomic threshold" that every daemon and any higher level process shall be named and explained (as a goal and thereby be on topic).

Currently I think this is tremendously useful to document, learn, educate, and enable users: to alert them to trouble, to calm the paranoid, and generally much more informed decision making.

I am mildly OK with a consensus that says "not for us", but if that is the case I would also like and hereby plead to have updated help center entries reflecting this with a much clearer definition. 

In the meantime, what are the fundamental issues and difficulties of this approach?

I just reviewed a First Post that was classified as an answer.
It had poor spelling, grammar, a lot of ranting and so on.
If that would have been all to it I were easily persuaded to apply a no paseran policy to this.
However, it was a first post, it showed much frustration and as far as I could tell it possibly had at least some grain of value in it, albeit just: "'no werky' here too" (to adopt the terminology I read here).

My problem now is that I got myself confused on how to proceed. Editing seemed out of the question, I didn't know what would happen if I just commented on that etc.
What I wanted was to tell the poster what was wrong with it so that he may learn and revise that question, or delete it on his own. 

I ended up flagging it as "unsalvageable" https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3008/251859since as an answer, I think it just was. But that user in distress is now also unsalvageable?

Isn't there a better way to give the necessary feedback?

Some "answers" aren't salvageable, such as those which basically say "tried everything, still doesn't work, the software s*cks" or something along these lines. It's always ok to leave a comment in such cases, I tend to use something like

It's like someone threw a bag of crayons at Windows 10.

The old 'fade out' version was fine. This is just a distraction.

For anyone who hasn't yet read the Meta post, this was what I was referring to - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300829/new-top-bar-is-coming-to-the-stack-exchange-network?cb=1New top bar is coming to the Stack Exchange network

It will be rolled out for moderators on all sites as well today (but it's not yet active). The old topbar had these bright colors as well, but only one or two pixels high. The new topbar is slightly higher, and they probably adjusted the 'underlay' upfront. But I agree with you, right now it's distracting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is distracting but still better than the new one.

The new topbar has been rolled out today to Meta Stack Exchange, and a few moments ago to ♦ moderators on the entire network as well. This is how it looks like for me, and is going to look for you all as well (except for the diamond on the right):

https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0jdG.png

You can see that the height of the bright rainbow has been reduced to a familiar level.



To disable the rainbow entirely, you can use a stylesheet manager, e.g. Stylish for Safari. Add the following rule for the domain apple.stackexchange.com:

body {
    background: none !important
}

Meta-users should already know this:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/why-voteWhy is voting important?


  …good content rises to the top …incorrect content falls to the bottom


But looking into https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votesthe questions by vote yields almost ridiculous results.
Some posts are there for historical reasons, as I understand. But the top hits are unnavigable wiki-posts containing much outdated information, several pages long. As I understand current regulations for what is or isn't off-topic here most of them violate more or less these rules. (That also implies that this tab features way too much bad examples for new users wanting to orient themselves by past good questions.)

Many of the more recent ones are also of very questionable quality, either in form or in content?

List of all packages of a package manager? Really? No-one answered something like RTFM? If this question does not show very little research effort, then what does?

Meta-users have this problem discussed before: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/783/251859Why does Ask Different have such a low voting percentage? Last post being from 2012 means: this is accepted fact of life here?

In the short time I have been active here I am very much impressed how much the voting behaviour of the users presently active fails.



  Voting up a question or answer signals to the rest of the community that a post is interesting, well-researched, and useful, while voting down a post signals the opposite: that the post contains wrong information, is poorly researched, or fails to communicate information.



Was this ever the case here?

After reading through some meta-posts and reviewing my own activity for quality control I just found the opposite in the wild majority of cases.
Someone gave me the feedback: 


  "Sometimes people really don’t like short answers or people don’t like long answers. I’ll get downvotes lots of times based on length alone."


If that is true as written then that alone should be somehow addressed?
Someone able to give that kind of feedback will surely not post "Me too", "There's an app for that", "Gotta link"-answer? And "We expect long answers…" is also in contradiction to this kind of voting behaviour.

And while upvoting good information seems to be at the usual low I can not shed the impression that some users with high enough rep to spend it quite aggressively keep downvoting certain content.

Only based on my own answers I keep wondering why I only received only one helpful downvote. On that, I received the notification for the downvote (prbably cast in ignorance or for arbitrary reasons?), https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3125/251859revisited the question, had to grumpily realise I made a mistake/was misreading the question and corrected the answer. 

For the entire rest of my contributions to this site I fail to see how they should be in violation of the rules or "contain wrong information, are poorly researched, or fail to communicate information"?

While it may be that my own communication skills are to blame for so many people misreading things I thought I made clear enough, some things are just inexplicable to me.
Examples may be found:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/296326/251859How to Restore the Default Permissions in Sierra? 
https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/298400/251859How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?


Trying to give context and prior research was criticised as noise in the first case. In the second: Trying to differentiate why I added to an old post and what differentiates this answer from the others (that were not wrong) was cut, but why it was downvoted in the first place when it was technically correct information from the start?

My personal highlight is this https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/296612/251859locate command with regex equivalent in OSX
There are two answers and a lot of opinion. One answer with a 3 vote distance upwards basically just says "no werky".
My answer addresses the general audience for such a question in general and in particular the exact situation, goals and level of understanding displayed by the OP's question.
Have I posted incorrect information there? Was it not useful, was it rude to anyone, devoid of information? If it were, and if that info were conveyed in comment…

Now I do not care that much for the lost rep incurred to me by that. The posts quoted are only meant as an example, where I am convinced of their fair quality and know their comment and edit history quite well. 

There are others like that. 
Examples after just skimming them quickly again: 

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/201539/251859Prevent update notifications in OS X 10.10.2 (Legitimate question? No bad comments indicating problems, edited, downvotes stayed.)

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/251356/251859How to get a list of available defaults write terminal commands (not too broad imho and similar Q&A abound.)

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/285898/251859How can I disable auto-play blocking on a per-site basis? (Illegitmate question? Progress to be observed and finally an least halfway useful answer.)

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/251781/251859“Permission error” when creating files on a new hard drive in Mac Pro (Serious problems with the question and the answer remain. Apparently several comments and edits. Comments partly removed, large discrepancy between Q and A despite being of similar quality.)

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/88859/251859Is it possible to install Mountain Lion on a Mac mini that is older than 2009? (Ignoring the quality of the final question (now: just like for the package-manager question as used above as an example) Progress towards shape very noticeable, votes remain negative.)

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/294690/251859How to reinstall macOS Sierra after formatting by Ubuntu (Strange scenario and description, yet the situation occurs, question heavily punished, yet an answer that is very probably wrong/incorrect in this situation gets upvoted (Recovery partition is likely gone in this scenario?) Scenario especially pressing https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/286311/251859since El Capitan and Sierra are not so easily available as previous systems.)

What I care about is that this behaviour seems contrafactual to the stated rules and goals here.

The quality-content buoyancy theory of site design seems to be failing for years now.
This whole post is less about the editing vs voting trope as it was driven to in the last paragraphs. It is about the dysfunctional voting in general and hereby reduced usability of the site; now.

Does anyone here has any idea on how to fix this frustrating voting behaviour?

Which attracts a lot of views (and upvotes).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix That's true. In one way. Aren't (google-sent) visits one thing, displayed votes from registered users another? Or do search-hit visitors register, try to gain 15rep, just to upvote?

But there are a lot of folks out there which have an account on at least one SE site, so upvoting is only one or two clicks away for them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the downvote you've received for the question here: Maybe it would be easier for people to discuss the topic if you would cite other examples than just your own postsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Ah. +1 OK, that will explain quite a share I haven't thought of.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thx again, 2nd DownVoter! 14 Views and very low constructive comments.

Is this club of dysfunctional poets now through, I have doubts still?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This sounds like a rant and not a constructive post. You are starting from the premise that voting here is broken and needs to be fixed. But I can't figure out why you think it's a sign of brokenness that your post is attracting downvotes. Perhaps "broken" means your priorities don't line up with those of other users. That happens, and it's okay.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel Thx for a constructive downvote! I am trying to align subjective priorities as expressed in commentless & never-corrected downvotes that way too often do not conform to the stated goals *with* those goals and a collective or collaborative effort. My premise is researched, explained and exemplified, I hope. Am I wrong on all of these or just one of "my post"*s*, or all the others as well? As declared above, I do not care about a downvote, that is not only OK, I welcome it. If it really helps; and an explaining comment really helps with that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Is there any way to ascertain/view why/when/*whether* a particular Q or A got into HNQ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC What is HNQ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Oh.

But those questions probably tend to get more upvotes than usual, not downvotes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Takes a while to parse: No hidden perks for higher reps to ascertain/understand/ 'just see'  (way past the fact/not immediately) what went on o certain posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC Maybe you can compose a query on http://data.stackexchange.com to recalculate the hotness score :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@langlangc or maybe not: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271213/how-to-see-if-a-question-was-a-hot-network-question


















As mentioned already in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/783/251859Why does Ask Different have such a low voting percentage? voting on AD sometimes doesn't work very well. My personal view on this is that there are just too few people caring enough about a specific question in general to vote either up and down. A lot of questions are probably too specific to certain users/use cases to gather more votes over time.

This also means that a post which required editing to get it into a good shape may acquire some down votes during the edit process which will stick to the post even after the editing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, if you look at the highest voted answers (https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&q=is%3aanswer) you'll find some real gems there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, a comment can make "the requirement for shape" much more efficient. And agreed on 'some' *real* gems. Finding gems is one reason for me being here in the first place. My point is that votes seem more often than good not a reliable indicator for that at all. Especially when a post *is* brought into shape and the votes remain the same. Sometimes I looked into the edit history and got a glimpse of why the downvotes may have been issued as they *are* when the post *wasn't* in shape.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@langlangc AFAIK the topic of notifying down voters of edits made to a post has come up before (either here or on Meta.SE) but didn't get a lot of traction.


















I submit that we should be discouraging answers suggesting reporting issues to Apple. Apple isn't, shall we say,  super interested in addressing reports from users about issues they encounter in cases where there isn't already extensive experience of the same kind, in which case pointing to references about that experience is the appropriate answer.

If the goal of such answers is to suggests ways one might get Apple to act on issues that are new or peculiar or rare, or about which little has been written, perhaps a better substitute would be concrete suggestions about journalists or tech bloggers one might contact who are in a position to place meaningful pressure on Apple, or who have the scope to explore the issue further.

I suggest that we do what we can to encourage the latter (which could be generally helpful) in favor of the former (which can often just seem dismissive or even provocative); or to point to existing references that address the issue where they exist.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Discourage "suggest to Apple" or "report to Apple" answersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you please clarify what you mean by "site policy": Do you expect moderators do delete comments/answers proposing reporting an issue to Apple, do you want to have people edit such remarks out of answers, or something else?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, that was unclear: Guidelines, e.g. in help, or even just consensus here (to link to).


















To be honest I'm not sure what problem we'd really be trying to solve here? 

It's also not clear on what basis you assume: Apple isn't, shall we say, super interested in addressing reports from users about issues they encounter in cases where there isn't already extensive experience of the same kind ?

To me it stands to reason that Apple would not have extensive experience on issues with its products if it wasn't due to the feedback of users, so we shouldn't be openly discouraging this.

I deal with Apple regularly and they openly encourage feedback, often referring users to their https://www.apple.com/feedback/Product Feedback page on which it is clearly stated:


  Apple strives to bring the best personal computing experience to students, educators, creative professionals and consumers around the world through its innovative hardware, software and Internet offerings. Apple welcomes your feedback on its products.


So for me, if an answer includes a link and/or suggestion to provide feedback to Apple as part of a broader answer, I don't see a problem.

I do think, however,  an answer that offers nothing more than a suggestion to submit feedback to Apple isn't really an answer and, in those cases, when Moderators are made aware of such answers we do have a role to play - perhaps converting such answers to a comment.

And perhaps the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answerHow do I write a good answer page could be edited to somehow capture that an answer which is nothing more than a suggestion to provide feedback to Apple is not an answer. But, to be honest, I haven't come across many answers like this, so once again I'm not sure what problem we're trying to solve?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We'll have to disagree about Apple's sincerity in encouraging feedback; but I expect that's part of the issue here. AskDifferent is a very pro-Apple environment, and really the entirely unhelpful suggestion to "report to Apple" is just a symptom.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/election/election page looks a little bit awkward, because the number of eligible voters is 'orphaned' on the previous line, at least for the first three elections:

The problem seems to be a missing <br>, which is included for the last election:

See https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/serial-voting-reversedhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/serial-voting-reversed (a link which is actually displayed in your reputation history in your profile). 

Basically, an unknown user decided to upvote a lot of your posts, a behavior which the system detected and corrected by invalidating/reversing those upvotes. There is nothing you could have done to prevent that from happening.

So, it's a balancing act and, while not perfect, it is better than any online system I've seen so far. :)

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/305330/can-i-download-free-apps-without-a-payment-method/305347#305347Can I download free apps without a payment method?

I clicked on the link to the question that it's a duplicate of and no answers were provided there. I clicked on the link to the question that that's a duplicate of and the answers are either irrelevant to the question that I asked or I'm bad enough at using iPhones that they don't make sense to me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my question marked as a duplicate of a question that was unanswered?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks so much for raising this question here. My answer is going to be a little messy since this topic is one that needs a good canonical question so we can point all the duplicates (yours is one of dozens) to the canonical question and answer.


















Similarly to https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2882/251859Discrepancy between help-center and community consensus? my latest question was judged to provoke opinion based answers and therefore clashing with the "definitions for this site in the help center".

When asking for:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/306357/251859How and with which free markdown editor can one write with good integration with this site

I specifically read and tried to follow: https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2181/251859How should I ask about getting a software recommendation? while phrasing this awkward question, hence the less than optimal title.

If the question in question does indeed not follow the rules according to the current community: 


are software recommendations now illegal across the board?
are help center and/or meta in dire need of reconciliation?


Since an indeed helpful comment suggested to put this into meta:

What takes precedence: help center, meta?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Software recommendation: Help-center information clashing with meta?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dire and clashing seem odd adjectives. Would you mind if I tried editing your post on the main site to test my potential answer ; BBEdit ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike not at all. The current state of the main Q *is* deplorable since I really lost it panicking while seeing the closevotes coming in. If the scalpel doesn't cut, use a little axe!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It might be hard to overcome a -5 vote count, but it can’t hurt. Worst case you earn a badge by deleting it and since it’s here on meta - assuming we can all agree it’s in good shape - we could probably have enough votes to counteract the initial disagree votes. It’s not my taste. Give me a couple hours to wrap up work and clear my editing brain.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Just a friendly reminder: I do not mind how many hours you need. I just wouldn't want to see the Q go under completely without trying sth first. If you think it's not worth it anymore, please elaborate in chat about BBEdit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Just a friendly reminder: I still do not mind how many hours you need. It's just sad to see the Q go under completely without trying sth first. If you think it's not worth it anymore, please elaborate somewhere about BBEdit.


















Software recommendation questions always have been (and will be) tricky on this site, so irregardless of whether a posts tries to follow  the meta recommendation it might get downvotes and/closed. In your case it was difficult to see that you were looking for a Mac based solution (there was neither a tag nor a sentence describing this need) so I understand why others considered it off-topic. But that is something which is easily fixable. What isn‘t though are questions which look for opionon based answers, these usually get closed rather fast. 

Having said that, I don‘t really see a clash between help center and meta. The meta article explains how to write good software rec questions, the help center defines basic characteristics of acceptable questions. So a question asking for Windows software or using rude language would get closed even if it follows the recommendations in the meta article.  But maybe I‘m missing some details here, feel free to comment. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thx for your patience. I reasoned posting to Ask is obviously asking for Mac-based recs as to be redundant to include again a sentence, same as using too many tags, but 'macos' additionally read more like for the OS itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is always iOS as well :-)


















I’d go with the site that has the most questions tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applescriptapplescript.
Currrently:
Stack Overflow: 6,184 ;
Ask Different: 1,922.

Keep up the great work! :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most Active Contributors Monthly Report - November 2017b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And [my hat](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/303371/165931) is off to you, Monomeeth, for this amazing review of the month.


















I want to say, even with the "most" reviews being easy to measure, I'm most proud of the quality of the reviews, edits, posts and comments that all are true community moderation here.

Some of us get to hand a diamond after our names for a while, but without everyone's work this community wouldn't be nearly as vibrant as it is.

Kudos and thank you whether you did one quality post / review or dozens.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to totally second that. Having only been a Moderator for a brief period, I have to say that the amount of moderation that goes on was a real eye-opener for me. Now, more than ever, I really appreciate the efforts of all users who take the time to edit/review/flag posts. While this report generally only recognises the top 5, the actual number of contributors is so much greater than this, and every one of them helps to make this site what it is. A big thank you again! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, thank you for your dedication and hard work. I'm just flagging a couple things for review here, nothing like what you're doing.


















I am unable to provide an answer to a question because, apparently, I'm a noob. Yet, I can clearly see there is a question here that needs to be removed because it is outdated due to an iOS update. The info on the question is moot and anyone coming here would likely be mislead by the answers. How can noobs also alert the community that some posts need to be flagged as old and new information added?  The question I'm referring to right now is: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126550/how-to-make-a-duplicate-of-a-photo-on-iphone-before-i-crop-or-edit-it?newreg=999c4c9b5b2e476c97f11614b4ec958eHow to make a duplicate of a photo on iPhone before I crop or edit it?. This issue no longer exists since Apple added a 'duplicate' button under the share function. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a question here that is outdated. How can we flag questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not every one has the latest OS and the top rated answer starts by saying that Apple have released a version with the duplicate buttonb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, now there's an answer. I didn't see that when I first went there.


















That particular question was automatically protected by the site due to the quantity of ‘answers’ the post received from new users posting things which weren't answers. Protected questions are an extreme minority of the questions on this site and it's unfortunate that it prevented a legitimate answer from you.

I have unprotected the question — go ahead and provide your answer, we wouldn't want to miss out on the knowledge you want to share!

Once you have a small amount of reputation here (e.g. one accepted answer), you may https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/flag-postsflag posts for moderator attention.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you, but someone has since answered it.


















In general, questions that are "outdated" are not in need of removal, but rather in need of editing to clarify that they apply to certain versions of an operating system and not to others.

An answer that applies to Lion but not High Sierra isn't wrong or unhelpful, but does need to be edited to make clear in what contexts it is helpful. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, makes sense. It was annoying because I clearly had the updated answer at the time but couldn't add it.


















For some reason, my question keeps getting close votes, claiming it is a duplicate of another question:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/310314/how-can-i-configure-iphone-to-stop-prompting-me-to-setup-apple-payHow can I configure iPhone to stop prompting me to setup Apple Pay?

From my perspective, I made it absolutely, unequivocally, crystal clear that these two questions are not the same, and the solution is not the same. Yet folks are still piling on the close votes.

What more can I do to keep my question from closing?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is my question being voted closed as duplicate, when I have made it clear that it's not?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've cleared the pending close votes now, so the post shouldn't show up in the review queue any longer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix I did this by voting to leave open in the queue, it was already removed :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside It still showed a (3) when looking at the post directly, so in my understanding it was still in the review queue as it hadn't gathered the five votes in either direction. AFAIK mod votes in the review queue are non-binding.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grgarside But that's an interesting question in itself. The question timeline says that the vote completed 9 hours ago (that probably was your vote then), but the two close votes got only cleared when I force-closed the question a few minutes ago. Hmm.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Good point about the 3 votes showing on the post itself, but the mod vote on the review queue is binding either way and the queue item shows ["review completed"](https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/close/224461). The timeline constantly confuses me because of how items are ordered by creation, then their removal/"cleared" status is ‘inserted’ inb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question was not closed and received a great answer. Thanks for your help, all.


















I don't think there's anything you need to do at this point. Your question is still open and two votes away from being closed, and your edit is helpful in pointing out how the potential duplicate does not answer the problem.

I don't think it's necessary nor productive to edit your question for each close vote you receive unless another comment is raised with separate concerns.

Just because your question receives close votes, that doesn't mean it's unanimous. It goes without saying that many people visited your question and didn't vote to close it, and also someone in the close vote review queue https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/close/224461voted ‘leave open’ (and I have also done the same).

Your first edit clarifying how it's not a duplicate was good. I'd say leave it and focus on looking for an answer to the question rather than meta concerns. You are always welcome to bring the discussion to https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatAsk Different Chat, whether before or after a question is closed, for further opinions and feedback on your question.

Whether the excel file contains anything malicious I can't say.

I posted https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/312094/72448an answer that included several screenshots from my iPhone. When I view the answer, however, the images make it hard to read the text of my answer. They seem too large, and they are aligned to the left of my text. The white background of the screenshot also blends in to the white background of the SE site. 

I've had this problem in the past, and I've tried a couple things. One, is I sometimes add a frame around my image. I also try to reduce its size by 50%. Not only is this a lot of extra work, but I'm still not satisfied with the output.

Is there a better way to handle this issue? Is there some sort of markup that I can add when posting an image that will make things look better?

I presume I'm not the first one to encounter this problem, but I don't see an answer here on Ask Different Meta.

It's almost February in 2018, which isn't supposed to be the proper time to cycle these, but for this year it'll be once again, so we'll be refreshing the Community Promotion Ads for this year now!

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting apple related open source apps
the site's twitter account
script packs or power tools
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/3190here.

As far as I understand the rules here the second question should have been marked as a duplicate, the answer to the second question posted under the first question?
Answering this with the merits of the second question/answer combination's merits is irrelevant.
Either the policy was ignored or the explanation text needs redaction. If these kinds of decisions are to be repeated, then in the future the dupe-closure text has to include "was now better asked", "has now a better answer"?

I was having the problem described in this question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/264463/capturing-screenshots-on-macos-sierra-is-very-slowCapturing screenshots on macOS Sierra is very slow. However, while searching I found https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300633/screenshot-taking-a-very-long-time-to-appear-on-desktopScreenshot taking a very long time to appear on desktop first (particularly because I had skipped Sierra and upgraded to High Sierra) whose answers did not help me.

By further research, it seems clear that these are in fact the same problem — it is a Finder problem that can be triggered by the use of any sync software. Accordingly, I flagged the latter question suggesting that it be merged with the former.

However, I don't seem to have communicated the situation adequately using flags, so the new situation is worse — the latter question has been marked as duplicate, but not merged, so the existing answer mentioning iCloud as a possible cause will now be less prominent.

Therefore I am making this louder, public request: please merge https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/264463/capturing-screenshots-on-macos-sierra-is-very-slow#308692Capturing screenshots on macOS Sierra is very slow and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300633/screenshot-taking-a-very-long-time-to-appear-on-desktopScreenshot taking a very long time to appear on desktop (or explain why this is not a good outcome).

(I can see it being arguably better to write a single answer covering both cases, since the ideal Stack Exchange question has comprehensive rather than partial answers, but I still think that merging is superior to not merging in this case.)



More history, not relevant to what I am requesting: The first flag I raised:


  This is not a perfect duplicate of apple.stackexchange.com/questions/264463/… but I believe that merging these questions would be beneficial to being able to discover the multiple possible causes of this problem (e.g. mine was only mentioned in the answers to the other question, but this one showed up because I searched for "high sierra") – Kevin Reid 2 days ago   helpful - Thanks. I’ve made sure to link the two questions. You can also help editing your post or answer to link here and explain the relevance.


I saw no edit or other action constituting "link[ing] the two questions", and I have no "post or answer" to edit on either question.

I then flagged it as duplicate, which was accepted, and then I flagged


  This question should be merged with its duplicate, because the answers cover multiple causes of the same problem that might be applicable to different (this one mentions iCloud, and that one mentions Google Backup & Sync) – Kevin Reid 2 days ago   helpful


but no action was taken.

I don't think that this is a situation that is extremely important, but I am particularly disturbed by the fact that the action I proposed was neither implemented nor rejected.

I personally do mark many flags as helpful when I don't make a change, so that's something that will certainly happen and I'm glad you explained the situation here.


















Initially I wasn't ready to merge all answers from this question:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300633/screenshot-taking-a-very-long-time-to-appear-on-desktopScreenshot taking a very long time to appear on desktop


And move them to this question:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/264463/capturing-screenshots-on-macos-sierra-is-very-slowCapturing screenshots on macOS Sierra is very slow


I think it's best to keep them separate since one is High Sierra and deals with Apple reasons for the delay. The other deals with third party reasons. Also - both questions would need an edit.

If we end up with 5 or so linked questions - we can revisit if making a clean "canonical" question to hold all the answers is best - but at this point the close as duplicate seems to serve all interests well. I have bounced this across the moderation team in our chat window and the consensus today is to not merge the two posts you flagged.

The best outcome I can see would be to have someone, perhaps you Kevin ask the fundamental question - "How can I use fs_usage or another tool to measure and diagnose a delay of 10 seconds adding a file to the desktop of Mac OS?" That question could be narrowly framed - link to all the questions (merged or closed or open) that exist and then have an answer explaining how to measure the activity that lets anyone know which of the dozens of sync services is throttling IO.

There are some answers on the duplicate which I don't think are particularly helpful, such as the one speculating that the screenshot location has changed, but I think that it would be best if they are all brought together in one list.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's been a week; any news?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi @KevinReid after thinking it over - I prefer to keep them linked and not merged. I'll edit my post to explain my thinking.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, I disagree. "Apple reasons" vs "third-party reasons" doesn't help the searcher, because they _don't know what the reason is yet_. What I needed when I was researching the problem was, ideally, an answer that said "Do you have any sync tools enabled, such as [list of software]" and then I (and both of the original askers, if the question had existed first) would have gotten exactly the info they needed. I suppose writing such a comprehensive answer is a perfectly good path forward...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds great @KevinReid - having good answers (and even better ones once we have a decent or good but narrow scope answer) is the ultimate reason for this site. Questions only exist as foils to get the great answers. Feel free to link here to your answer. I'm sure I'll find it +1 worthy.


















I propose renaming the tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/podcasts-apppodcasts-app to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/podcasts.apppodcasts.app for consistency with other app tags.

The majority of tags for apps on iOS, watchOS, and macOS end in .app to specify it is about the platform-specific app, rather than the service itself. For example:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/activity.appactivity.app, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-watch.appapple-watch.app, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contacts.appcontacts.app, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mail.appmail.app, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music.appmusic.app,  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/notes.appnotes.app, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photos.appphotos.app.

I am not a points hound, so am not concerned, but AFAIK my answer, which directly addressed the question by an obviously non-technical user, provided a clear factual answer in non-technical terms. I posted it to provide additional detail, and because I did not feel the other answer would be particularly helpful to the OP.

The other answer was upvoted, and provided a good link to technical information, but did not really answer the question.

At the moment your answer basically says „it‘s possible but it‘s hard work“.


















You nailed the feeling - it’s not really about the points, but that lone -1 stings a bit more than it should.

I still get that feeling and I’ve got so many “fake internet reputation points” it’s not even a fraction of a drop in the bucket. But, the one thing that really makes sense is when I answered this question in a comment quite a few years ago.

Yes - someone, somewhere (and only one someone) clicked one button on the screen. Maybe they were right and your answer was awful, but that’s really not the case almost all of the times.


search this meta for “not an answer” flag - those are the hardest ones to get right and it almost always means “I don’t like this answer” so people’s opinions on what’s not a good answer can run strong and almost always are about something else - their day, their experience, the words in the post, dissapointment they can’t use that answer.
Look at some +10 answers which get a badge and aren’t anything special at all. Like this one - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/104575/5472https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/104575/5472
Look at some 0 point answers that are amazing like these:

Here’s a gem of an answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/59056/5472https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/59056/5472 ( this user is in my personal hall of fame - so much deep knowledge and a gift for writing just the correct amount of words - no more than needed, always impeccably correct and thouroughly contemplated. )

Basically, you’re in good company getting a -1 for an answer that is probably quite useful. It’s hard work to keep up with all the posts and upvote the ones that are useful. I hope anyone that stumbles across this thread is encouraged to vote up good answers, edit those that could be better - edit and fix answers that struggle and be constructive with comments when a -1 is justified.

However, this answer has just provided catharsis for me on the issue, and maybe even acceptance.  As usual, bmike, you're words are wise. +1.


















The entire Q&A is unfortunate since there already exists a duplicate question (which this question is now closed and points towards).

However, ignoring that, if I had caught the duplicate answer when it had less votes, I would have deleted it, with a comment for the poster to edit your answer to improve it. Unfortunately the number of votes all the answers has received has made me less inclined to delete the duplicate solution. I wish I had seen the Q&A earlier — somehow I missed it even with it being a HNQ (which is what attracted further votes).

Considering the entire question could be removed as it is a duplicate in itself (not saying it will be or it should be), I think in this case the best action in this case is to leave it as it is.

Just trying to understand why you wouldn’t take action.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Josh Votes show the community thinks the post has value. It's not just moderators who see that a post is a duplicate, so if people still think the post is worth being there despite being a duplicate solution, then they are welcome to vote it up. Votes do have their part to play in decision making, with its weight dependent on the severity of the problem. In this case, the duplicate did add some value and voters decide what that balance is. Meta questions like this is a form of ‘judicial precedent’ on SE and I encourage you to provide your own answer here if you so wish to make your case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grg Ok.

As of now, expect 2 days for the time period to reset, but it could be sooner. 

Flag bans are automatic based on recent flag history, both being put in place automatically after a certain threshold of declined flags, and being lifted once the declined flags leave the time threshold for being counted.

While moderators are usually the ones who handle the flags and as such are the cause of a flag being marked helpful or declined, moderators take action on the flag itself and not the user who raised the flag.

Each flag is handled independently (except in rare cases such as with custom flags providing background information that should be handled) and flag bans are not ‘given out’ to users manually by a moderator.

Therefore a moderator cannot remove a flag ban, no matter how nicely someone asks on meta!

As the flag ban is based on recent flags, as time goes past previously declined flags fall out of scope of the formula used to determine whether you should be banned from flagging.

I posted https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/320317/why-was-used-as-the-command-key-on-apple-computers-why-not-the-apple-logothis question on Ask Different a few days ago. In this short time, it became very popular and got over 25 upvotes. However, a moderator put it on hold for "being off-topic". I have the highest respect for the specific moderator in this case, but I just wanted to put it to Meta, are questions on Apple history on-topic or is the Ask Different forum just for practical questions about Apple hardware/software?

Firstly, thank you for your involvement and contribution to the site. I hope you find it to be a valuable resource!

With regard to your question, although it wasn't me, I agree with the Moderator's decision here. The question you asked is certainly interesting and a great discussion topic, but it's not well-suited for the main Q&A site. 

The main Q&A site is designed for questions from users who have a practical problem they are trying to solve with their Apple product or service.

The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here? page provides a great summary of what is on topic. And the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askWhat types of questions should I avoid asking? page is also helpful.

For questions such as the one you asked, we do have a https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatchat room that allows for more general discussion.

The word ‘meta’ in the .meta-title is a serif font instead of sans-serif. The font family was previously sans-serif, but is now using the default font for the browser, which in Safari is Times.

I have been active on Ask Different for around a week now. Although I still end up making some mistakes, I am gradually managing to get a hang of the system.

This is my first time on any of the Stack Exchange sites, and I am enjoying my time on Ask Different. I have already managed to read and understand the help documents and FAQs.

While I managed to earn decent reputation points, one thing that I am still having hard time understanding is how the chat system works?

I may be missing something here (something really stupid), but I find myself unable to join the chat. Are the rooms invite only? Or are there public rooms too (for eligible members with enough reputation points)?

I am also not able to figure out the mechanism to create a new room and invite members.

This is the message that I get, every time I try to access Ask Different chat.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/kxcqR.jpg

As I understand that 20 reputation points are needed to participate in chat and. I believe I am past that barrier, but I don't still see the option to join a chat room. Please help me through this.

Let me see if I can locate the place where you need to make your “chat account” - once you have that account, then it gets tied to your account.

It occurred to me, asking out loud on meta could help!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - this works great to ping site moderators - we all get a “ping” when a meta post arrives.

With help of another moderator, I located a problem with your account.

Each person gets one “chat” account and it has a parent account on one of the sites. Your parent was on Stack Overflow and that account had 1 rep only. For whatever reason your other accounts with PLENTY of reputation didn’t get credited. I re-parented your chat account but I cannot clean up the original problem unless you request to merge those accounts.

If you don’t have other problems, no need to merge. If you do, just use the https://apple.stackexchange.com/contactContact link at the bottom of any page or the link to the left.

I don't know whether this belongs in main or meta, so I'll start here.

I seem to have developed a sudden case of 'Duck', bottom right of every SE page [except meta] - it reminds me of the old Microsoft paperclip/puppy that I always loathed.  

https://i.stack.imgur.com/vMRWt.png

It seems to only be on Stack Exchange pages, so I'm assuming it's some new 'feature'. I'm not going to click on it to find out what it is.

Anybody know how to get rid of it?

April Fools? Rubber Duck Problem Solving

I suspect an April Fools that has launched too soon. See https://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/Rubber Duck Problem Solving and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debuggingRubber duck debugging:


  In software engineering, rubber duck debugging or rubber ducking is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tg7Ba.png1 Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.


Clicking Ask the duck! starts recording with the microphone – oddly no security confirmation from Safari for this permission.

After a moment of spinning a graphic, a visual and audible Quack occurs, followed by the following message:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tg7Ba.png

There's no confirmation because there's no actual microphone access, try pressing No when asked if you have a microphone.

I thought it was somehow bugged.

As a new user on Ask Different, and of Macs in general, I have a limited amount of knowledge to contribute to the community. I was drawn to Ask Different while seeking and later discovering a solution to a range of problems that feature in multiple questions on here.

The solution, however, is achieved by installing a single application, so I'm concerned that returning to all these questions with the recommendation of this single product will appear like astroturfing and raise suspicion, especially considering my lack of otherwise unrelated activity.

I am entirely unaffiliated with the application and its developer, and I would of course strive to answer the questions according to community guidelines in a relevant, individually tailored fashion.

Should I be concerned about being accused of astroturfing?

If I were accused, would I be afforded the opportunity to argue my case?

Does this scenario warrant the consideration of additional guidelines to avoid putting other, new users in the same dilemma?

Although https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/promotionthe Ask Different Help Center's page on spamming does suggest I'm not at risk given my independence, the specific scenario is not addressed.

On https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1826/could-we-set-out-objective-criteria-for-what-is-spam-or-commercial-promotionanother Ask Different Meta question, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/9388/danielDaniel has https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1829/283275suggested a help page for users charged with spamming who are seeking recourse:


  I'd be more okay with a more aggressive anti-spam approach if we had a help page about "My message got deleted as spam but I wasn't trying to post spam. What happened and what can I do?"




For added context, other meta-discussions from various communities have emphasized volume, affiliation, seniority, recency, and relevance as factors in targeting astroturfing, factors among which many seem to stack up against my case:

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1826/could-we-set-out-objective-criteria-for-what-is-spam-or-commercial-promotionCould we set out objective criteria for what is “spam” or “commercial promotion” here?


  If a new, mostly unidentified, unregistered, 1-rep user posts an answer to an old question, and the answer mentions/links to a commercial product or service, or a sketchy blog/article linking to such, my shit-detector goes off.

  If a user's first post is to recommend software that actually is relevant to solving someone else's problem, I'm inclined to give the user the benefit of the doubt. Now if the same piece of shady software keeps popping up in first-post recommendations, if the user only recommends software in answers and nothing else[...], fire away.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Community approach to legitimate quasi-astroturf answering trendsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for a) answering on the main site b) realizing this might need some community discussion c) reading the help d) asking here. Well done on many fronts. I appreciate your care here very much.


















I would say - this is the perfect place to ask and make recommendations as long as you are here to answer all sorts of questions and help. When that happens, there's going to be lots of answers that have nothing to do with a specific product you may know and find useful.

The astroturfing / spamming is really for when an account only posts marketing blurb - endlessly and exclusively and you'll likely get some signal you're off bounds when those posts get comments / deleted / down voted. And then if it continues you could expect a personal message or a time out which would be very clear and explain for how long / why / who to discuss with.

So - in summary - we could look over the activity of an account (yours) to see what's up. I see two answers about Steer Mouse so you might want to explain in a comment if you made that app (and probably self disclose in the first or second paragraph of the answer if you do get paid by that app or service). You could also put that in your public profile.

As long as you don’t get paid to promote that app or are the developer, you should be fine as you answer all sorts of questions. If you ever are with a possibly conflict of interest - just make that clear you are a developer of X or the founder of X or work as support for X - that lets everyone know you're being open and might be biased so that the quality of the answers gets voted and not that you support product X and are here to shill it.

I voted up each of your posts since they:


Answer precisely what the question asked
Are not just "BUY THIS IT'S AWESOME"
Are well worded (if a bit long)


In the future if you find you want to post the same answer to more than two questions - let's try to flag those questions as duplicates and merge it down - there really shouldn't be 10 answers that say the same thing to 10 different questions. Most of the people that get into trouble with astroturfing either miss the maintenance of the questions - don't close them or vote to close or the only thing they ever do is post on that one topic.

In this case, you clearly are editing the questions, making things better so I say keep up the work and check in after you have 5 or 10 answers posted or ask a follow on meta question if you run into any comments / disagreements you can't work out with someone on the main site.

The cleaning up of duplicate questions has started:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22797/Increase horizontal speed scroll on Logitech Mouse
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287333/How can I independently adjust the horizontal and vertical mouse tracking speed on a Mac?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119305/Excessive horizontal mouse scrolling
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22797/Increase horizontal speed scroll on Logitech Mouse
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/136237/Adjust horizontal scrolling speed on a mouse or trackpad independent of the vertical speed


I probably could see one or two canonical questions - how do I get software or settings to change the native scrolling in general and a second question that narrows down how to get different curves for horizontal vs vertical. From there, we'll have dozens of questions on vendor X and how their software is [awesome|awful] since it changes things and people can have differing opinions that change Y is good or not. Most of these will then get closed to the main questions explaining how to manage / extend scrolling on the site. this will certainly be a community effort since any one person may make a mistake voting to close or curate these.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You raise some good points, namely that there will be due warning before permanent action is taken against an offending user's account with ample time to react and that the series of related questions can be conflated into a few, comprehensive canonical questions; that really gets to the heart of the issue, and in hindsight it is a more direct approach. I'm sure it will solve most other situations like this one.

My next move was going to be a flagging-run to several of the questions you mention, so I'm glad you took the initiative.

Thanks for the up-votes. I'm glad it was appreciated.

Is this data definitely accurate?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SkeletonBow Yes, it's accurate, **but** (there's always a 'but') upon checking it again I see it's only counting those users who have voted a minimum of 10 times in the period. I've gone back and added a note to that effect. All the other metrics count *all* users, so I'm guessing the requirement for 10 votes is just an added protection against identifying how users vote. Apologies for not picking that up earlier!


















I have been fairly active over the past three weeks. I have a tab with newest questions open all the time.

I couldn't help but notice the amount of spam that gets posted on the site. Just curious for various reasons, why does this happen? Isn't there an automated way to stop it? The pattern of the posts appear consistent. Why aren't the spammers discouraged after seeing constant flagging and deletions within moments? Could it possibly be a bot posting the spam.

Not to be argumentative here (hah!) It seems that the definition of "Off-Topic" is fairly clear (IMHO) in that the subject matter is something that is open to interpretation, varies with your experience and/or level of expertise and can provide a multitude of "correct" answers.

The types of questions outlined in the description seem to be exactly the kind of questions you would want to start a discussion of the relative merits of the various solutions. Perfect for MacInTouch, Reddit or even Facebook. They want and need these types of questions to keep people coming back for more. Generating a lively discussion involving opinions is pollen to a bee to sites like that.

Whereas AskDifferent is designed to look for the canonical One Correct Answer to a specific technical issue. You should be able to look at the answers and go, "that one nailed the problem and provided the best solution." Which is why the user that asked the question is solely responsible for declaring the one answer as the one that worked.

Yeah there are often many ways to achieve the same desired result, and that can be down to opinion. But the only opinion that is acceptable is the one that works for the person who asked the question. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well worded arguments and differing opinions are the _reason_ for meta. Thanks for putting down these thoughts.


















What about script writing?
(I know it appears outside the scope here, but hear me out for a second).
It could be argued that this is a recommendation to find an off-site resource for developer services.  There are many questions where the questioner is looking to solve a particular issue with a script they have or they are stuck on the logic portion.
However, this morning, I ran across this example:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/322906/119271Batch embed video files to html files (with Automator?).  The author essentially lays out a scope of work for how this script should work essentially looking for delivery of a final product.  It's my opinion that this should be closed because something this involved is why/how developers make a living and we're not a script writing service.
That said, I am not against anyone stepping up and writing this for free, I just think it's a recommendation/shopping question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very good point. I think scripting and automation questions should have a different close reason - MCVE - https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve - Clearly, asking for a book or site to solve X is trivially off site resource, but legitimate scripting questions might need MCVE and “show your code” guidance developed on Stack Overflow.


















I seem to regularly have problems adding code to my answers so that they're formatted properly, and I don't know if it's a bug, me, a combination of the two, or something else altogether.

By way of example, today I posted this https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/323172/168832answer. Now, in case I get it to appear properly, below is a screenshot of the portion as it currently displays:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/P3t9x.png

As you can see it's not really displaying properly. I've tried following everything in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2626/168832How to improve this source code quoting?, but often the result is the same.

I've also tested this using different hardware, software and operating systems. 

What am I doing wrong?

This is happening all too often, but I'm not flagging it as a bug yet because I figure it must be working okay for others.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why doesn't 'code' formatting seem to work for me?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Multiline code formatting works better if you use four or eight space characters instead of `` ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyway, what do you mean by "display properly"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@patrix Thanks for editing the answer I posted earlier - that's exactly what I meant by *display properly*. :)

We do have the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/software-recommendationsoftware-recommendation tag. This might be a good place to talk about when that is appropriate.

Good question! And thanks for seeking feedback here as it helps other users too.

This can be a tricky issue because it's often subjective (and therefore users are influenced by their personal experience, feelings, tastes, or opinions).

In this case, the question itself could have been closed on a number of grounds but obviously the community didn't think it quite crossed the line, so it still stands. To my mind you've answered the question and the community by and large has agreed by the number of votes your answer has received.

So, in a nutshell, you haven't broken any promotional rules. 

However, to help reduce the risk of users judging an answer as being promotional, users can take some steps. Using your answer as an example, users can:


Be less emotive. So, instead of "You can also purchase at great prices from them." it may be better to say something like "Generally they offer competitive prices."
Use a clear disclaimer. Have a clear disclaimer that declares your interest, if any, when referring to a product, service, website etc. Something like "Note: This is not promotional just trying to provide a site." is not as clear as something like "Note: I have no affiliation with..." or "Note: I happen to work at..."
Offer multiple recommendations. Where possible, provide more than one choice so that it's less likely to be judged as purely promoting a particular product, service or website. If you've only used one personally, you can specify that so it's clear you haven't used the others.


As I said this is often a subjective topic. Some things are very clearly promotional (or even SPAM), but others can be caught up in that grey area of uncertainty. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For anyone wanting to add more steps that users can take, feel free to edit this answer. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will edit my answer accordingly. I think all 3 suggestions are extremely helpful. And thanks for the explanation. I do agree, in this case, that the community agrees with your (and my) opinion, but obviously some people will disagree, hopefully the suggestions will help these people understand a bit more.


















Review queue privileges are unlocked after crossing certain threshold of score. However, I have observed that certain review queues become unavailable once I hit the daily voting limit.

As I understand, no up/down voting is involved when working through various review queues. Why does certain review queues (like First Post, Late Answers) become unavailable till the next day after I have exhausted my daily voting limit?

https://i.stack.imgur.com/fVQst.png
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Review queues unavailable for the dayb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Welcome to advanced site moderation status Nimesh. You are now part of the crew that keeps things clean and tidy and running smoothly.


















Before I dive into the specifics of close reasons, let's be clear about "Surely all these questions should either be open or closed" – since this site is community moderated by volunteers across time zones and across the globe – there will never be a unified bar on what all questions are and how to interpret the line between a poor question or a good question, and the system is designed to work around that lack of one clear line between good and bad.

Also – when I say moderators I mean all of you that vote and flag and edit – not us handful of elected moderators or the site operators and staff.



As to this specific post - we have dozens of FaceBook whats app questions open so this just looks like a run of the mill situation where one post was closed since different people had different positions on what's off topic and what's on as opposed to a hard line being crossed and everyone is in perfect agreement that the post is low quality.

Your premise is correct – there should be no preference for one third party vendor or another – and even our "problem child" app of Clash of Clans that draws the highest count repetitive, poorly worded, pleas for basic customer support questions isn't "off topic" due to clash of clans. The bad questions asked about those third party apps should be closed due to general low quality issues - not that it's about COC.

The initial revision of this post is a good example of a question lacking any basic troubleshooting and is simply a two sentence plea for HELP if it's not clear what a quality problem might be with a question in general.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/325818/unable-to-download-games-on-my-phoneUnable to download games on my phone


Back to the main point, should https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/325672/168832this post be closed? In this case, I disagree with the close reason – there's enough research and clarity that a good answer could be added. Furthermore, this is a widely used app and this is a core feature of that app that's broken so people will need help understanding how to fix that feature on iOS.

Technically, now that it has an answer, I don't think there's a huge benefit to reopen it since I doubt another good answer will be provided, but as part of levelling the data and doing the theoretically "right" thing – let's leave this open unless we discover that you and I are the only ones that feel this should fall on the "OK to be open" side of the basic trouble shooting close reason. This looks to be a subtle interaction between app features, iOS SDK design decisions and not some basic feature the OP missed in a third party app.

I think it should be reopened/undeleted provided that the author... 


cite the sources he used (and referenced) so it can be determined which versions of macOS/OS X it supposedly worked with
instead of deleting the file/folder, a command to back it up (i.e. mv foobar foobar.bak)


I personally tested (on a VM) this and while it didn't crash my system I did lose login data (wasn't important...just reverted to a previous snapshot).  As it stands, I would down vote the answer and leave a comment to back up the folder prior to attempting.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you very much for testing and considering this. I've undeleted the post and added a brief - please backup before you mess with keychains warning and also trimmed the meta. We may need to augment it with links and fixing steps....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I think you misunderstand the issue with the "answer": It results in a complete loss of all relevant data. That's like saying the way to remove a slightly musty smell from some documents is to burn them. Nothing can be gained from preserving it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@orome - We delete when posts don't fit the qualification of being an answer.  Their relevance, quality and usefulness are subjective and should be voted on as such.  The bottom line is, it's an *answer*.

Late Note:
This was broken for several months, but is now working again.



I Like grg's method, & in fact use it myself quite a lot for quick edits to posts.

There is another method, slightly more work, but this not only reduces the apparent size on screen, but also the actual image size - useful for if you're on the phone, etc.

Assuming it's your own upload, start by dragging your image into the uploader as usual, this will generate markdown like this

[![enter image description here][1]][1]  
  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg


take that bottom line & duplicate it..

[![enter image description here][1]][1]  
  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg
  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg


Then you make two changes...
in one link, add a character after the last existing character of the file name (not the extension)
You can use m for 'mobile' or s for 'small square'
In the other, change [1] to [2]  

so  

[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg
[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg


becomes  

[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEnm.jpg
[2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg 


You then change the original inline tag to reflect both versions...
    [![enter image description here][1]][2]
in this, the first ref [1] is the display & the second [2] is the linked image.

The result is this...

[![enter image description here][1]][2]  
  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEnm.jpg
  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg


It doesn't actually matter which line becomes which option, so long as your inlined link refers to the smaller image for display & the larger for click-through.

Which then displays as this...
If you click it, it will open full size.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg

or alternatively as a small square...
Note I've duplicated the mobile line & added a small square as [3] so both versions refer to [2] as their full-size version.

[![enter image description here][3]][2]  
  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg
  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEns.jpg


Which then displays as this...  more useful for gallery views than rectangular pictures.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/skJEn.jpg

As pointed out by https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/37797/grggrg in chat, this is actually an Imgur feature rather than SE.
There are various sizing options...

s = 90×90, b/t = 160×160, m = 320×320, l = 640×640, h = 1024×1024.

I've found myself at odds when reviewing questions surrounding the beta version(s) of macOS (in this case, Mojave).

For me (in the tangled mess that is my head), there are legitimate questions to be asked about beta versions:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/327356/is-it-possible-to-hack-a-macbook-so-as-to-be-able-to-install-macos-mojave/327365#327365Is it possible to "hack" a MacBook so as to be able to install macOS Mojave?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/299903/what-determines-whether-a-drive-can-be-converted-to-apfs/300575#300575What determines whether a drive can be converted to APFS?

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/291556/how-to-update-ios11-betaHow to update iOS11 Beta


These are answerable questions about what's possible or how things work.  

Then there are the questions that the first response should be: file a bug report with Apple.

It's beta software, after all;  it's going to have issues.  This is even more relevant concerning 3rd party software.   So, I'm wondering if there's a consistent approach we can take with these like closing with a custom reason (i.e. bugs in beta software should be reported to Apple) or have a canonical answer we can point to.

Thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some Clarity on Beta Questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/327087/macos-mojave-developer-beta-safari-user-agent-change-not-persistent has an answer which would help in closing all "file a bug report" type of questions as duplicate. We could also go with an artificial question for this, if it makes more sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside - that answer was exactly what I was thinking of could be (at minimum the basis for)  the canonical answer/response.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I must share that tangled mess of yours in my head too! LOL Agreed, Some *Beta* questions are legitimately on topic, and others aren't. Sometimes the differentiation is obvious, but often it's not, so I fully support the need for a canonical answer/response for the *It's a bug, report it to Apple* questions. I think the [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/327225/168832) posted by nohillside is a great basis for one. The only thing I'd probably add is something *encouraging* the OP to actually take the action to report the bug (rather than relying on others to do it).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The categories you made up here are already useful. Apart from Apple OS remains now in beta until another major upgrade is released: One thing of more practical application for this site is of course to add to "bugs in beta software should be reported to Apple" the very necessary heads-up "bugs in beta software not rom Apple should be reported also to the devs of the actual software"…b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We should really have a pop up when using a the beta tag explaining how it’s NOT for bug reporting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not all the answerable questions are so e.g. APFS - the rules might change before release e.g. Fusion drives in High Sierra. Beta is beta and expect bugs and you need to talk to Apple - restore - you need a complete backup  before start beta if not the only responses has to be a long laugh.


















The post in question is "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/327630/is-there-a-way-to-rename-menu-items-in-firefox?noredirect=1#comment419418_327630Is there a way to rename menu items in Firefox?"

Generically speaking the OP is saying that "because a third party application has a particular bug/limitation, an Apple feature/function doesn't work."  The OP then poses the question "how can the 3rd party application be modified so that Apple's feature/function meets my needs."

To me, this is an issue that falls within the realm of the developer of the 3rd party application.  Especially so since the bug/limitation (specific to the question) is consistent across all platforms (macOS, Windows, BSD/Linux).  

A moderator seems to disagree citing that "because it runs on macOS, the question is "on topic."  A lot of things run on macOS, that in and of itself doesn't make it on topic or something that can be answered.  For instance the question "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/327514/how-can-i-access-the-source-code-of-my-mouse-via-the-terminalHow can I access the source code of my mouse via the terminal?" involves a product that technically "works" on macOS but there's no claims of support or compatibility; even the Linux support is from another independent party.

That said, rephrasing or reworking the question to state "because a a third party bug/limitation, Apple's feature/function X doesn't work.  Is there a way to work around it so I can accomplish Y" would be easily keep it on topic.

Thoughts?

Often there are *other* reasons these questions can be closed. And, as you point out, sometimes it's easy to rework them so they *are* on topic. It'd be good to see what other users think, so hopefully we get some answers/comments here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth - I agree that questions about 3rd party apps are, prima fascia, on topic, it's as you state, the *reasons* (aka "details) that cause them to be closed.  I am all for reworking a question but not without at least some communication with the OP.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing it up, Allan!


















I like to look at this from a distant perspective any time I look to moderate between two people on whether something is on topic or off topic by reading over the core tour and help articles:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/tourhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/tour - "Ask Different is a question and answer site for Apple enthusiasts and power users [...] to build a library of detailed answers to useful questions about Apple hardware or software."
https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic


The on topic has 4 main sections:


Apple hardware 
Apple software 
Apple services including iTunes Connect (selling music, books, apps) 
third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products.


So, the last item sure makes a practical question about third party software on-topic. Unless there's a problem with practicality or with scope, we should err on keeping those questions open and here for an answer.

From that framework - we can pick apart any flaws in the linked questions and review where they are on the spectrum of "I have a question about Apple designed software on Apple hardware" to "I had an iPhone in my pocket when my spouse asked for a divorce, what should I do?"

Also, the one bit of thinking that helped me is, even if the best place to get the answer is a vendor forum, that still makes this a good place to ask so someone can explain why the vendor forum is the best place for specific support.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this phrase *Unless there's a problem with practicality...* sums up the perspective I was coming from in that particular question.  But, I think the reasoning *...that still makes this a good place to ask so someone can explain why the vendor forum is the best place for specific support* is the key differentiator.  New (and old) reviewers and mods should see this (IMO) succinct bit of logic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd phrase that as "vendor forum *might* be better". Frequent problems with *"is"* Either very big vendors might be really incompetent at solving a problem ("mac-marginalization": having trouble with getting your mac to work with something from HP, I'll probably not ask there anymore) or some smaller projects do not have the man-power to deal with problems, that others might have solved in the meant-time or are able to solve. In both cases competent answer might be found here as well or even more likely.


















Generally speaking this site is for people using Apple products, the hardware used in combination with them, and the software that runs on them. So any question relating to any of these is more or less by default on topic.

Looking at the two examples you list in the question:


Firefox: The OP may not have a way of knowing whether the problem is macOS or Firefox specifics, so posting here is perfectly fine (especially since they already did some research and found out about *.nib files). The probably best answer then is, as you write in the question, that this is a general Firefox issue and need to be raised to the Firefox developers (same as we do with other defects).
Mouse: I agree that the question could be better phrased as "How can I make use of the special features on macOS", but that's a detail easily fixed by an edit. One answer could be "there is a Linux driver, maybe you can port this", a better answer could be "there is a port of the Linux driver at github.com/foo", and an awesome answer of course would be "I ported the Linux driver for you, check it out at github.com/bar".


To summarize: Look at the problem from the eyes of the person posting it, and based on the intention they have. If it is about using Apple products it's on topic and should be edited accordingly.

Or in other words: why close a question if you can easily answer it while staying on-topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well said. I was going to say the _Mouse_ question has a decent answer of "here's how to run linux in Docker and then attach the USB device to the VM and run the app to fix the mouse LED behavior" but I like a direct port if that's something anyone has done.


















I see this as an edge case. We typically expect edits to be substantial, but this post is very short so it’s hard to tell how much better the question reads with some punctuation and grammar. 

I could see rejecting that sort of edit myself, but looking at it I’ve reversed the rejection. Also, that post is already answered, not even you upvoted it once and no one else did until I just cast a +1 and it’s 3 years old. Not sure bumping it will do much of anything so I respect the decision to not bump it and react the edit if that was the thinking. 

Thanks for posting a question on why. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However the end result still has grammatical and spelling errors.


















I agree with that edit being rejected, and while I was not one to make the actual rejection, this would have been my reasoning for rejecting it:


The post already contained a link to the official website for the app and a couple of other links to get started, such as a signup link.
The app is cross platform and does not need to be purchased from the App Store, such that the App Store link need not be the foremost link of the post.
The (huge) ‘Download on the App Store’ badge takes up unnecessary space in the answer.


Edit rejection reasons can be custom, but in this case the one used by both reviewers was one of the standard choices. Even so, it's worth looking at the precise language used in the reason since it very much applies here.


  This edit does not make the post even a little bit easier to read, easier to find, more accurate or more accessible. Changes are either completely superfluous or actively harm readability.


Also @nohillside has some excellent https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3290/37797words of wisdom:


  Also keep in mind that an edit in the review queue must be reviewed by several other users. Let‘s make the most of their time by making the edits substantial.

In addition, my personal preference is that when a link does need to be added, that a plain link more than suffices without the need for the App Store badge.


















Is there any way to search for questions that have a certain image in them? I am looking for a question that I got an image from, but can’t find it in search.

No. The stack exchange search is for text so you would need metadata embedded in to the image in the form of a where to URL showing the image link. That text would be easily searched for. 

I would recommend tin eye reverse image search or another search image meant to classify an image. Hopefully they have crawled and indexed either this site or https://imgur.com/https://imgur.com/

When we close as a duplicate it doesn't really matter which question was asked first but which question got the "better"/more helpful answer. I know that the "on hold" reason implies otherwise, but as this site is all about getting good answers the focus is more on the answers than the questions.

If things change (e.g. a jailbreak becomes available) it doesn't matter which of the questions is open or closed. People who want to answer will find the open question easily, and can provide an answer there.

PS: Whether a question about the availability of a specific jailbreak even is on-topic and doesn't qualify for getting closed due to "missing research" or "asking for an external resource" is a different matter...

In an effort to make new users feel welcome at AskDifferent, many users (including myself) have commented on problematic posts welcoming the new user to AskDifferent, explaining the problem, and providing ways to solve their problem. Most of the comments start with 


  Welcome to Ask Different :) 


and then have links to relevant help pages. Each one, although very similar, are not exactly the same. Some may include information and links that others don't, etc. 

I thought it might be helpful to create a list of responses to common problematic posts for users to refer back to.


The list would help new users to know how they should be posting
The list would help users attempting to correct these posts do it in a respectful, but helpful/useful way
It would allow the community to have a more uniform way of handling these scenarios


I know many of these responses can be found on other meta posts but I wanted to consolidate all of them.

These responses can be slightly altered to accommodate the specific Q or A.



Some example scenarios:


Duplicate question
Commend added as an answer
Off topic questions
Posts breaking the Be Nice policy
Duplicate answers
Questions with minimal information that need explaining

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5May I suggest to add the "source code" for all those comments? Maybe even in two forms: 1. as it would be pasted into the comments box (because of the links, incl.magic links) 2. as it would have to formatted for AutoReview? (Compare that to [Health](https://health.meta.stackexchange.com/q/868/11231))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's another option. I chose this format because it's easy to copy/paste it into the script *in one go*. Separate forms with source code are indeed useful for users who just need it for a single instance, but it will make the collection harder to maintain I guess. Other sites ([Mathematics](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4925/228959), [CS Theory](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1381/32711), [TeX](https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/q/430/117218)) have similar repositories. BTW, I'm fine with whatever format we choose for this.


















I'm at a loss to understand why my question is off topic.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/328854/why-do-macos-ios-upgrades-take-so-longWhy do macOS/iOS upgrades take so long?

Presumably I've run afoul of asking the following verboten question:


  
  Asking how/why Apple does some thing XYZ.
  


So, am I really prohibited from asking how Apple does upgrades and why it sometimes takes a while?

These Stack Exchange sites generate a lot of negative emotions in me. I think I may need to quit for my own health.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is my technical question about macOS/iOS upgrades off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for bringing the discussion here! +1 for the best place to discuss and review the voting.


















Overall I don't think it is off topic.

But,


  If the system is in /System, why isn't an OS upgrade simply creating a
  /NewSystem, putting all the necessary files in it (all in the
  background, without interrupting the user), renaming /NewSystem to
  /System, and then rebooting?


Is basically asking why doesn't Apple just create /NewSystem... So I can see how it may be perceived as 


  Asking how/why Apple does some thing XYZ.


when in actuality (I think) you were asking more like "wouldn't it be faster to do x"?

Edit for clarification

“Wouldn’t it be faster to do x” is still borderline off topic. I think you were getting a bit confused because what you intended to say and what you did say were different. And people marked what you did say as off topic.

Even without that paragraph it would basically be why is updating so slow. Which could be marked as too broad.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well said about the “why didn’t apple do X?” aspect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even „wouldn’t it be faster to ...“ is borderline off-topic bacause it basically can only be answered with speculations.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside As a software developer, I disagree strongly that an empirical question such as "wouldn't it be faster to do X" could only be answered with speculations. There are specific technical details that might render such a method unusable, which could be provided in an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@taylor I agree. But anybody who knows these details for a fact can't provide an answer because they are Apple employees and are not allowed to post internal information. As Apple outsiders we can just speculate, and speculation is not facts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Well, I think we should be encouraging Apple employees to break the silly rules and post anonymously.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@taylor Maybe they do, who knows. But as long as they post anonymously we have no way of knowing whether their answer is correct...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside X may not be restricted to macOS only meaning that people with experience with other types of computers maybe able to answer accurately. Updating occurs on almost every modern device and almost all of them require restarts from time to time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jbis discussions about how computers work in general, interesting as they are, are off-topic. Look, the SE sites are about questions with specific, verifiable, and acceptable answers. „how to improve OS upgrade performance“ is an interesting question but there is no clear answer possible, so it‘s better asked on a site/forum open for discussions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside If the question is specifically about macs, someone can use there knowledge from other computers to answer a question. For example if someone asks about disk recovery on a Mac, it can be answered by someone who knows little about macs because drive recovery is pretty standard across all computers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5P.S. I’m not totally disagreeing with you here. The part I quoted is borderline off topic but I think the entire question isn’t.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JBis Disk recovery is a specific problem with specific, verifiable answers. Discussing OS upgrade strategies is open to a lot of opinions, only verifiable by people with access to the macOS source code (aka Apple)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JBis I agree on the quoted part :-) The question would actually be better without this paragraphb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside or maybe edited to change how it’s asking.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Well that’s another debate. The only variables are really the type of drive and the type of damage to that drive. “I spilled water on my Mac SSD” and “I spilled water on my PC SSD” is going to have identical (or very close to identical) solutions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JBis LOL, let me rephrase that: "Discussing OS upgrade strategies is open to a lot of opinions, only verifiable by people with access to the source code of the OS in question. As non-Apple OSes are off-topic anyway and source code to Apple OSes is only partially available..."


















My initial thoughts are that your question looks like a rant and has a ton of “meta” and explaining as opposed to being a very simple phrasing of asking how to figure out what’s happening during an install.

To avoid getting further down votes or close votes, would you be open to shortening it to 1 to 2 paragraphs basically asking How to benchmark a clean install and/or review the install log after a long install to learn what happened and when?

Seems to have a lot more words than necessary. 

(Side note, asking why Apple does anything is also pretty explicitly off topic. Focus on what specifically you want to do given some objective definition of what “too long” is to you. Also, please don't take this as a judgement that questions asking about why Apple does X are inherently bad, they're just not what this site aims to do. Focusing on practical questions and avoiding ones that are highly subjective or come out years later when the people at Apple that explain why they did X or decided Y doesn't help people make usable questions on how to use a product. The damage done by the distraction and noise of these justifies the rule in my eyes, but I get not everyone will see it that way. That's why we have meta to reason out if the rules need a change.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the answer bmike. I really can't stand the pedantry of these sites (not blaming you). Super unwelcoming, and I don't really want to participate further. Anyway, I do think there's a little annoyance in the question ("take so long"), but it most definitely is a technical question and not a rant. I focused on the length of the operation because I'm not sure I want to get bogged down in the minutia of everything that happens during an install, but rather the operations that take a while.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, there are many great answers to question fo the form "Why does apple do X". That rule is completely foolish. I despise all these rules, and don't want to associate/interact with people who are rigid rule followers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Taylor can you add some links of good Q&A about „why does Apple do X“?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Talyor Also keep in mind that this site is about getting good answers on actual problems. „Why doesn’t Apple use thisandthat“ can only be answered by Apple employees (and they aren‘t allowed to do so), so how do you find a good answer here? And which problem does it solve if people speculate about better ways to do X? Just look at the many comments beneath Allan’s answer. They are a good indicator that there is no fact-based answer possibleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Well, if you want to constrain yourself to easy questions of the tech support nature, fine. Plenty of good "Why does apple do X" questions can be answered by referring to their Human Interface Guidelines. And then there's the history of Apple, which is quite interesting. The tagline is "Answers to your Apple Questions." It should be "Answers to your Apple tech-support questions."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@taylor See https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic, mainly "If you have a question about a practical problem you are trying to solve...". The practical problem you are facing is "How can I speed up OS updates", the answer is "you can't, only Apple can". Everything else is speculation (which might be interesting to discuss but is off-topic for the site).

I was looking for some https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=telegramTelegram related questions, and noted there's no tag for it, although there are quite a few questions about that topic.

Can someone with the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsCreate Tags privilege can create that tag?



Update to include more details regards the request:

An excerpt example:


  Telegram is a cross-platform cloud-based messaging app. Use this tag for questions, issues and usage of Telegram apps running on iOS or macOS.


Example for questions that are entirely about Telegram (similar to questions about WhatsApp), and can fit the tag:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/202725/new-user-notifications-on-telegram-appNew user notifications on Telegram app
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/246940/run-multiple-instances-of-telegramRun multiple instances of Telegram
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/244409/where-does-it-save-downloaded-mp3-file-from-telegram-web-servicewhere does it save downloaded mp3 file from telegram web service


Questions that mention Telegram and so are shown in the https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=telegramsearch results, but shouldn't be tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/telegramtelegram (or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/telegram.apptelegram.app?):

https://telegram.org/faq#q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-hereAbout Telegram in general:


  Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use Telegram on all your devices at the same time — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Create 'Telegram' tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In case you don't feel voting on meta commonly - a -1 isn't that you should not have asked here (you should have and +1 to you / big thanks for asking) but that it's an indication that someone (me in one case) feels we shouldn't implement this now. You lose no reputation for - votes on meta and once it's worked out what the tag wiki scope would be - a second question with all that detail would likely get positive votes and be implemented (assuming it had consensus / significant net positive support and no big problems)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! I wasn't sure about the meaning, good that now it's verifiedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wow - this helps a lot - so telegram is a privacy forward / cross platform secure messaging app so that people that wanted different encryption than iMessage allows or different endpoints, they could use this app?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pretty much, although I won't say most people switch because they want different encryption, it's usually because of the security focus, speed and tons of features.


















I'm disinclined to create a tag when the simple search function would find all telegram related posts. You've shown quite well that search works to find each and every telegram related post you cited.

Could you expand on your request a little by providing an answer here to your question that answers what the tag wiki for this tag will be? Keep one mind, a tag that is "posts tagged XYZ are about using product XYZ on Apple" generally never serve a function better than the search "criteria" I mentioned in the previous paragraph to "use search and not tags"

https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/tag-excerptshttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/tag-excerpts

Here are the three questions I'd want to see answered before I would be the person to pull the trigger and make that tag taken from the link above:


The excerpt should define the shared quality of questions containing this tag — boiled down to a few short sentences What should the excerpt be for the telegram tag?
Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag (this would be "telegram tag is about using telegram on Macs"
Concentrate on what a tag means to the Ask Different community




The good news is there are some volume of potential questions, so we should do the work to map out a wiki in case we do want to make this tag sooner rather than later.

Be sure to call out any questions with that search term where we would not want the tag to be applied and document it here in your answer / or a follow on post to create a tag with the wiki and use cases mapped out explicitly.

I wanted to have a short discussion on one question that looks problematic in terms of scope:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/302285/modifying-the-menu-barModifying the Menu Bar


If you look at the initial version, it had a generally problematic closing which I've edited out.


  I'm not looking for a just specific answer (although that would be nice), I just need any information regarding the menu bar at all that would help lead me to my goal. Thanks.


The problem with that is that it acknowledges that this will be a discussion magnet / me too magnet / and makes it seem not a practical question that should have an actual answer that can be voted upon.

I do see how it could cover just about all the things we ask for in an off-site recommendation question. It clearly documents what is needed, what level of detail is needed, Apple may provide this documentation and anyone who knows how / where Apple provides this will knock that answer out of the "ballpark" so to say. Third party writers may also have documented this in a book or a blog post, so there's a good change this knowledge is out there.

My main reason for listing this is it sure seems like a Code Level question / framework programming question and runs afoul of our long established site scope to not host "programming" questions here. If this is a good recommendation question and it's really in the end about programming, it should probably go to Stack Overflow, no? I hesitate to migrate it since I don't know how well received it might be if it lands there without more code in the question.

If anyone has strong opinions and needs to cast close votes - I wanted to discuss it here whether it stays open or gets closed since I think this is a really good example we can hold up on where the line between scripting and documentation and code level questions are for the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Discussion on recommendation / menu bar reverse engineeringb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The OP has 1 question at the beginning (looking for the location of the files) and another question at the end (book or document about the code).  The question could be read "I need help with my code" or "I'm looking for feature documentation so I can code".  This could be read as off-topic, I believe, if you think the core of the question is the OP wants coding help.  I just don't get that from the question, though.  My reading is they're looking for a resource the same way someone wants a book recommendation on Automator scripts.


















I personally feel we should all step away from 95% of the beta questions due to this clear wording from Apple:


  Is the public beta software confidential?
  Yes, the public beta software is Apple confidential information. Don’t install the public beta software on any systems you don't directly control or that you share with others. Don’t blog, post screen shots, tweet, or publicly post information about the public beta software, and don't discuss the public beta software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in the Apple Beta Software Program. If Apple has publicly disclosed technical information about the public beta software, it is no longer considered confidential.


The don't discuss the public beta software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in the Apple Beta Software Program seems to make there only a few correct answers that anyone can post to any Mojave / 2018 beta question:


Apple has publicly demonstrated / disclosed the thing you ask about - look at this link to explain what we can speak about without breaking NDA.
Apple has not publicly disclosed X - Now I will speculate based on what Apple did on the shipping OS and guess how Mojave handles things. (Also - this could be helpful “rubber ducking” without NDA ramifications.)
Apple has not publicly disclosed X - I care less about strict adherence to my NDA (for reasons) than trying to help out here; so here's my take on what's happening based on first hand knowledge I have running the beta.
I didn't sign the NDA, I don't know if Apple has publicly demonstrated X and therefore may have no idea what I'm talking about but I do have feelings or opinions (that may or may not be correct for reasons). (This also could contain some helpful “rubber ducking” of the issue that gides the OP to an answer as opposed to giving the OP an answer).


Now - these answers above are a bit trivialized / simplified, but you could probably boil down any response and classify anyone's well intentioned / well thought out answer to any Mojave beta question into one of the four above classes.

Now, as one of the elected moderators, I'm not going to shut down / delete these since I'm not the parent of anyone and if someone wants to speak out publicly and is willing to take whatever repercussions do or do not happen based on them breaking their agreement with Apple or if they feel there isn't an agreement for whatever reasons. However, I do want to remind everyone that there is a cloud of uncertainty every time someone asks about beta software so we all can be kind to people who may not have thought through what they're asking someone else to do.

Also - I need to review each and every answer I've made on beta software so I can think if I'm mostly a #1 answerer or a #2-4 answerer myself (or come off to anyone reading as that type of answerer regardless how I perceive my actions.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree and believe we shouldn't be posting any beta questions.  We all know this is pre-release software, NDA or not, so the expectation is that defects and issues **are expected**.  I love helping people who can't solve issues themselves but I pause at helping people who use beta software because the answer might not be valid after the next release (and I might've unintentionally misled a future problem solver).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder if we could recommend each question had a reference showing that Apple announced said item, thus making it not confidential. I’m sure it wouldn’t always be followed, but I need to think through how that would actually work here before making it a new post. Great points @fsb and part of “rubber ducking” any question is of huge value in solving issues - be they confidential or not. The one huge problem with outright bans on beta is people will just not say they’re running beta and post as if they were running 10.13 causing even more harm and confusion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whenever a beta is announced, I find myself referencing [your previous post on beta software](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) quite often for guidance.  I thought of requiring Radar #'s on questions but we can't police that.  I think **all** beta questions belong on the developers chosen platform for reporting issues and not on a public site such as this.  I'd be all for a beta ban to make it easier on everyone, including the developer.


















@bmike has some rather well thought out questions and more than a few answers to issues surrounding helping folks with their intent to install or actual installation of the public beta (and presumably the dev install) on a Mac they have access to.

I was brought to this thread by his link in a comment on a comment I had made on https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/329383/can-i-fresh-install-a-beta-version-of-macos?noredirect=1#comment422379_329383a question that felt like it had gone off the rails.

No doubt others are familiar with the well intentioned answer that goes into a great detail on if this should be done or not. Which is certainly a question that should be answered, but in this particular case didn't really answer the question:


  Would creating a bootable installer and booting from it be a good idea, when I'm working with a Beta version?


If you work in IT support (as I do) you learn to understand (or at least interpret) a user's question "why can't I print to PDF?" (for example) as "I don't have a PDF printer option any more, how do I get it back?" EG a non-technical question about a technical subject.

I interpreted that particular question as the question's author assuming that the beta installer was somehow special/different from the installer you would get from Apple to upgrade from Sierra to High Sierra. Which it might be.

So I ask the obvious (to me...) question


  [...] have you tried making a bootable installer like you do any other macOS installer? Instructions here from Apple support.apple.com/en-us/ht201372


Pointing to Apple's article on how to make a bootable USB installer for macOS.

bmike suggests that this should be an answer. Valid point.

But I have not actually tried that method with the public beta and am loathe to provide an Answer when it is little more than a suggestion that may or may not work. It seemed too brief and off the cuff to be an answer but it did seem worthwhile, especially in light of the other answers that were less about actually installing the software and more about if you should.

I will often make such suggestions in the comments if a possibility springs to mind, especially if I haven't tried it myself, and wondering if that would be an acceptable use of a comment?

This really is a challenging topic - you are 100% within your choice to only answer when you have solid experience - that’s kind of my main argument against having beta in the first place. The very people you want to answer are most likely to not do so - and for very good reasons. It’s quite a dilemma to know you could help but choose not to and asking clarifying questions in a comment is one very good tool to refine someone’s thinking. Thanks for the answer here. +1b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I get to half baked I'm doing good, LOL...


















Hi and thanks for hopping he for a discussion. I haven’t read the edits, but my initial take is you’re asking some5ing that’s more like a wiki article - list all th 5ings that are X. 

The big improvement I would say in general - what practical thing are you going to do or prevented from doing? That sort of edit cures almost any ills that cause close votes to accumulate.

I certainly don't want to ask for a list. An answer to "Is... more extensive than a few emoji" could be answered in the affirmative with a *single example*, and in the negative with an answer of the form "As discussed in this article in reputable trade magazine X, the emoji's are a special case, and in general MacOS does not block content." which is  what I'd expected and I"m sort-of surprised such an answer hasn't been forthcoming already!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If a list were actually *needed* to talk about MacOS content-blocking beyond emoji, that would be both very surprising and quite disconcerting!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After considering [this comment](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/45544275#45544275) about a different question that also had "list-like potential" I realize that that argument might apply here as well.

As https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themesmentioned on meta.stackexchange.com several months ago, all network sites will be getting updated themes. Ask Different is one of the first sites that will be updated. As such, I'm posting the design here so you can see how the new theming will be applied to your site.
I want to acknowledge that this will be a painful change for sites that have rich, custom themes. I want to reinforce that the theme changes are a required step to deliver ongoing value to the sites with as little friction as possible. We released changes for https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/312180/354333tag watching (aka favorite tags) this week and will be releasing a beta of custom question list functionality soon. The only way to make sure Q&A improvements are quickly available to all Q&A sites is to fix our themes.
To recap from the original post on themes:

Every Q&A site has its own theme. But there is great inequality in the level of theming that we support. A few (~10) get https://photo.stackexchange.com/Cadillac treatment, some (<50) are more like a https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/Honda, while most (~100) are a https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/Yugo. The reality is we created a theming system that we didn't have the design resources to fully support, thus the inequity. In addition, as currently defined, our theming gets in the way of releasing new features on the sites.
In order to deliver the left nav, responsive design and future improvements to all sites we've created a more standardized way to support theming. This will reduce the burden of supporting designs as we make Q&A improvements. The result is that most sites will see an improvement in the level of theming that they can get. While some sites will see a reduction. All of Q&A (Enterprise, Teams, etc) will standardize on this new theming scheme.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/329976/88313The author of this answer claims to represent a company asked about in the original question.  This user just joined the site 45 minutes prior to posting the answer.  They're currently listed as 'unregistered' on their SE profile.

I did a quick google search and there is someone with the same first name who works at the company they claim.

I can't say that the person posting this answer is the same person who works at that company.  Because of the nature of the question, I think if this person is who they say they are would lend credibility to the answer.  If not, the answer is deliberately misleading.

The privilege of reviewing first-time questions and answers according to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/access-review-queuesthe guidance provided in the Help Center:


  The purpose of this queue is to give special attention to users who may need to be educated on some aspect of our model and to posts that are more likely to need improvement.


I'm not sure how to guide this new user in a way that would improve their answer.  Is asking for proof they are who they say they are the best way?  Maybe asking them to update their profile with info and links that would help people evaluate their authority on the answer?

What would be the best approach to take for such a review in order to help a new user as well as others who might have similar questions.

I think the part about being from the Flipd teamis irrelevant.

On SE credibility is NOT based on your age, experience, or position in a company. It is based on your reputation. The user in question (as of this writing) has 1 reputation. Their answer should be interpreted and treated as such. (Not to say that low rep users can't write good answers, they can & do).

The user should be treated as if they were any other user. Same as if a user named AppleEngineer123 answered a question and claimed to be an Apple Engineer. I would take them claiming to be an "Apple Engineer" as a grain of salt, especially if they are low rep.

I think the part about being on the software team is relevant because it's how the answerer is stating knowledge on the subject matter.  I agree that if was just any low-rep user making the same statement then credibility would default to rep.  I also want to help the new user improve the answer, if possible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb Edited a bit. I'm unsure whether it should be removed or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the comment helps greatly and appreciate that someone from the company would choose to help clarify how they use MDM. It also lets me comment on their post to perhaps help them point to their documentation that Apple clearly says is the MDM responsibility. Even if Ana isn’t from the company - they aren’t trashing the company’s reputation so I see harm in deleting or editing and help in having that self-disclosure there. @nohillside is 100% correct - we shouldn’t worry about the answer until the question is fixed first.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I wouldn't want anyone to be inclined to upvote or to not downvote because Ana claims that she is from the company.


















Am I going mad? Is this a recent change or have I simply never noticed it before?

When you scroll any SE page, the top bar, search etc stays in place [wasting screen space]. If I need to look at the top bar, I know exactly where it is & can get there with a single click/keystroke. I don't need it following me down the page like a lost puppy.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Top bar on SE sites... changed [again] recently?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I sort of like the search bar following me. Sorry.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No need to be sorry ;) Any pref that doesn't have an off-switch is a 'bad move' in my book... now we found the off-switch, we can all have it whichever way we prefer.


















You can disable the stickyness via your https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/edit/currentsettings under 'Preferences':

I got it from [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/312501/2952320).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That would seem to imply it went live only yesterday [when I was out all day] so at least goes some way to disproving my 'madness theory' ;) I also note the hideous new sidebar is to get an off-switch too. Sanity may still be preserved, after all.


















The Request

I set out on the Crusade for the Holy Grail of no-redirections (named by https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/135848/denilson-saDenilson Sá) to eliminate every https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64450/ban-url-shorting-servicesshortened URL on Stack Overflow. But the foreign hordes are overwhelming me, and I need reinforcements!

The Mission

Please post in the https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatmain chat room a link to this post and that you’re going to make 5 edits or so.

It isn’t good when several people make edits at the same time and flood the active question queue with a dozen minor edits. Thanks for being gentle with the edit volume, everyone. 

Find every shortened URL, follow it, check it and inline the unshortened/long version into the post, like this:


  For details see the documentation here: http://tinyurl.com/3zbelpahttp://tinyurl.com/3zbelpa


Turns into:


  See the http://meta.stackoverflow.comdocumentation for further details.


Watch out for https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/15650/ban-lmgtfy-let-me-google-that-for-you-linkshidden LMGTFY links and flag them for Moderator Attention if the answer only consists of those. If the answer does also hold valuable information like other links or further information, edit the LMGTFY-Link out, and leave the above link for future reference.

If you encounter links to duplicates, vote to close/flag the question, and edit the answer anyway.

But, watch out for traps! As https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/3043/joel-coehoornJoel Coehoorn♦ informed me, there are edge-cases which need the existence of shortened URLs. Including but not limited to:


Certain Wikipedia-Links
Archive.org Wayback-Machine
Browsershots.org
Google Books


Make sure that you're not breaking any of these by inlining them.

If you find shortened URLs in comments, there's at the moment not much we can do about them. LMGTFY and other objectionable content needs to be cleansed flagged none the less.

Also there are shortened URLs hiding in the woods (known to some as "Code"), these are no danger to our lands and can therefore be left unchecked and unchallenged.

The Tools

Our most valuable light in the darkness of the night is the search (roughly sorted by number of hits, cleaned ones at the bottom (doesn't mean that they don't come back)):

While paying a visit, https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/132734/rob-hruskaRob Hruska showed us the way to http://security.thejoshmeister.com/2009/04/how-to-preview-shortened-urls-tinyurl.htmla magician which allows us to see beyond shortened URLs without fear for ourselves. https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/150562/jeff-mercadoJeff Mercado also showed as an http://longurl.org/apparatus which does the same. These are only tools on our crusade to protect and help ourselves, we need to cleanse the land from redirections nonetheless.

The Reward

Eternal honor and glory...and of course you can keep every captured Flag-Weight and Badge.

Please be sure to not add your Amazon affiliate code to the edited link.  I saw you added the code to an Amazon edit and I removed it.  [Affiliate links are not allowed](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/142528/325653).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb How do you remove an affiliate link?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt You have to explicitly add the affiliate link for it to be there.  Copying the link directly from Amazon's site will not include it. I simply edited the url you put there and removed it prior to approving the edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb Actually the system [automatically rewrites Amazon links to be affiliate links for Stack Overflow](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26964/auto-inserting-stack-overflow-affiliate-into-all-amazon-links) with the `rads.stackoverflow.com` domain; if you use your own affiliate link (which I don't think happened here) it simply gets overwritten by the SO affiliate link.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi Matt. I count 18 edits in the past 8 hours so I’ve put a 24 hour throttle on your edits. Please adhere closely to the 5-7 edits a day guidance and the communication edit I made. I pinged @allan in chat to alert him to your combined efforts being a little too fast today. Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Matt posted an [edit he made](https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/241090) and it looks to me that an affiliate link is in the edit and it doesn't look like the one @Aurora0001 indicated.  Is this the SE affiliate code: `radianexuscor-20`?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb Nope, that isn't an SE affiliate code as far as I know, but I checked the original link and the affiliate code was there in the goo.gl link. I think the worst that happened here was that Matt didn't remove the pre-existing code rather than adding his own.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I started a similar pursuit on Stack Overflow. Feel free to look at the post [here](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/321494/6083675), since my list of shorteners is much longer.


















Thanks for doing this. I just want to add some points here:


Please make sure to fix not only the URL but revise the post as a whole. Usually there are more things which should/can be edited to increase the usefulness of a post, try to address all of them. Keep in mind that all your edits need to be reviewed by several other users and make sure that the reviews are worth their time
Restrain yourself to 5-7 edits per day. Every edit will place the question back onto the front page and we want to avoid situations where the whole front page is used by old questions.
Make sure that the link is still valid. If not, look for ways to make the post useful without the linked information, or try the Wayback machine. If all else fails, and the post is useless without the linked information, flag for mod attention.
Link only answers (where there's no editorial or just the obvious words of "click here" - consider editing them to add the context and make it an answer. If you can't and the link truly is trash, vote down and flag for deletion or a review rather than just editing a short link only answer.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Point #1 is crucial, I shall repeat here something I posted in chat since I don't know if Matt saw it: make sure to resolve all problems with a post and there may even be cases where the link is extraneous entirely, e.g. https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/228726/revisionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Point #5 don't add your affiliate ID into the expanded links. That's a paddlin'.


















I appreciate posting the mockups. It's hard to know how that translates to the two extremes of a 27 inch iMac and a 12 inch MacBook so it might be super great and it might need some tweaking.

I do really like how things look on Stack Overflow with the sidebar - so I'm super excited to turn this on here to test or just have it change and then give any feedback once I can use the design on an actual device to interact with the site.

Statically, the things that make me happy like the rainbow treatment under the black top nav bar and the compact sizing of the top bar are welcome. I would always get more space vertically for content over having top nav so for me side nav fits how I use my devices 90% of the time.

I'm especially keen to see how the full design renders on iPhone X and iPad Pro - I spend 85% of my time here on the iPad - 5% on iPhone X and the rest Mac browsers. I almost never use the mobile layout and have pretty much abandoned the iOS app. If your design can impact the hover treatment - please consider making sure you expose all data that hover would show with a single tap on iOS browsers. Working most of the day on iPad - the sites that have critical information only exposed via hover are a big disinclination to me when I decide to use a site.

That is impacted by a combo of new theme and responsiveness which is impossible to show off with static comps.


















What’s wrong with https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/241090this edit?
I thought shortlinks were banned and should be removed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is wrong with this editb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just ask @Allan in chat. No need to create an entire question based around it especially when you have already gotten the go-ahead from mods in your other question.


















It looks like the editor now detects and prevents introduction of some new short links and we're asking people to go slowly with the edits to avoid flooding the queues. I do agree that in general we should avoid them, but perhaps there's a reason to keep them here that Allan can share.

It looks like there are some rollbacks so let's see if Allan can join us here or we can make a chat room (private if needed) to work out any disagreements on edits. So, unless that function changes - a rollback seems to be the only way to re-introduce a problematic shortening service that’s been hard coded (or configured) into the site editor.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/259064/revisionshttps://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/259064/revisions


For now, Matt - let's move on to another post and give this one some time to settle. You've made your suggested edits there twice so let's see if the author and you can come to an agreement?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64450/ban-url-shortening-servicesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I actually tried to edit a bit.ly link after @matt flagged me on an old post and the editor won't let you use bit.ly links any more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. Wow - that’s cool. I’ve edited my answer as I’ve now received the memo, loud and clear.


















I will say having super old posts pop back up to the top of the queue and require my attention just because someone wants to do some housekeeping is kind of annoying. Without some explicit moderator or Stack Exchange direction to remove all short links from the site, this all just seems like noise and busy work to me.

If you have that kind of free time there are more useful pursuits IMHO.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you enlist other useful pursuits which can use some time?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NimeshNeema Improve recent posts requiring improvement, answer recent questions which don't have an answer yet, sit in a park and read a book, enjoy a beverage with a friend etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside nailed it :)


















I rejected that edit because I was unaware of the "crusade" at the time and assumed it was superfluous.  When I got the notification, I just clicked "rollback".  Now that I'm aware of the crusade,  I've gone ahead and re-edited the answer deleting the link so it's no longer an issue.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks Allan! I too took a while to see what the change was about. I still feel a little uneasy calling this a “crusade” since the connotation of decades of religious wars seems a little over the top so I like to think of it as a community effort : - )b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Couldn't have said it better!  (And you usually do!)  :-)


















In general, not at all. Each answer should be voted on because of the content of the specific answer - and not because of the person posting.

The bounty system is designed to transfer many votes at once. Voting on answers also carries far more numerical rep than voting on questions.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/bountyhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/bounty


I would say if you find yourself doing more than three to five votes at a time for one person - be sure to look around and reward others as well for good content.

I just try not to do 20 votes in a day to them even when they deserve it


















This was part of a recent UI change to make flagging more obvious.

As mentioned by Monica, this is an intentional change to make flagging more discoverable. We can all agree it definitely does that.
This is a work in progress and we are working on some additional changes to improve the layout of comments. These changes will build on the changes we made to make comments responsive and will use our Stacks design library. As you can imagine and as this post proves, changes to comments layout can be controversial, so I'll post more as we rollout additional changes.

https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/312794/222623Why are the comment upvote and flag options always appearing now?
Some CSS can reverse this change:

.comments-list > .comment:not(:hover) > .comment-actions > :not(.comment-score) {
    visibility: hidden;
}

I’m away from my computer to add screenshots/instructions but you should be able to add it to a CSS file that you choose in Safari Preferences > Advanced > Style Sheet



















  Is it ok to “thank” someone by upvoting many of their questions?


No.  This practice is contrary to the overall objective of https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/why-voteStackExchange in general:


  Voting is central to our model of providing quality questions and
  answers; it is how …
  
  
  ...good content rises to the top
  ...incorrect content falls to the bottom
  ...users who consistently provide useful content accrue reputation and are granted more privileges on the site
  


By voting on questions/answers for the sake of the person rather than the value of the content causes the content to be artificially promoted/demoted.


  Voting up a question or answer signals to the rest of the community
  that a post is interesting, well-researched, and useful, while voting
  down a post signals the opposite: that the post contains wrong
  information, is poorly researched, or fails to communicate
  information. The more that people vote on a post, the more certain
  future visitors can be of the quality of information contained within
  that post – not to mention that upvotes are a great way to thank the
  author of a good post for the time and effort put into writing it!

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please see my comment for under @bmikes answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JBis - that's relevant, how?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"By voting on questions/answers for the sake of the person rather than the value of the content causes the content to be artificially promoted/demoted." One may be voting due to content, but may have the opportunity due to the person posting. (If I don't see a post I can't upvote it therefore by specifically looking at a specific persons posts they will naturally get more upvotes).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Repeating what you said, doesn't clarify it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure how to clarify. Your reasoning was that it would be voting for the person not the content. I explained how you are actually voting for the content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not **my** reasoning.  What you posted is how you *justify* your voting methodology.  I'm addressing your question, "Is it ok to “thank” someone by upvoting many of their questions?" *directly*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough....


















Basically because Stack Overflow has https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topicvery specific rules about asking software development questions and most such questions posted on AD are written in a way which would get them closed/rejected quickly on SO if we just migrate them over. It's easier if the OP familiarizes themself with the rules, maybe searches for existing questions relating to the same topic, and then asks a specific question on SO.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe turn this more into a feature request post. Where in the edit menu the OP will have the option to migrate to SO. That will give them the option to edit and move to SO when/if they feel readyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jbis what would be the benefit of that? If they need to edit anyway they can easily create a new question on SO. If they can just migrate the post themself (which AFAIK no SE site allows) the effect would be the same as if we automatically migrate it. Maybe meta.stackexchange.com is the better place to raise this if you aim for a new feature.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't remember the last time I saw a post worthwhile of migration to SO. I believe that close reason shouldn't even include a link to SO — since many posts are now deleted I'm not sure SEDE could help, but anecdotally those who follow the link and post their question have it downvoted and closed anyway. People should be encouraged to familiarise themselves with the scope of the destination site, with suitable wording for close reasons, but also by avoiding automatic processes. @JBisb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grg Can you please tell what SEDE stands for? I am unable to guess the appropriate expansion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nimesh [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/apple/queries)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @grg, I wasn't aware of this tool :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nimesh It's great fun, enjoy :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Migrations also bypass things like the automatic duplicate-checking and making sure it has the appropriate tags. That (and the reasons outlined above) is why we avoid migrating questions in general. It's almost always better to simply re-ask in the question in the context of the correct site.


















I've noticed several times that I got three or more upvotes the same day.

Not a "thank you" because it has happened when I haven't posted anything recently.

My hypothesis is that someone was looking for a topic, found an answer or question I had created some time ago, and decided to look at some of my other answers or questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have done and received that before too. Same idea.


















At the top of the question, page is a search box. Just type in a phrase from an earlier question and the site will search its records. The Ask Different room will only search its questions. And the same for other rooms.

But thanks for yours. One rope you mention is "room"; I had a question migrated to Ask Different meta, and another put on hold as wrongly directed; does this mean meta is a room, and there are other rooms for different topics? I've been to the tour, and that doesn't mention them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just used rooms as a way of saying different sies for Q&A. There are many. If you click the three-line icon at top right you'll get a menu option for "More Stackexchange Communities".  If you click that you'll get a whole list of the communities or rooms.


















The http://stackexchange.comStack Exchange network of sites, of which http://apple.stackexchange.comAsk Different is a member are designed to make the process of finding answers quick and simple.

The member sites provide access to easy to use and powerful search tools. Also, the answer discovery is seamlessly interwoven in the process of asking the question itself.

Here's a typical list of steps one can take when seeking an answer on Ask Different, or any other Stack Exchange site for that matter:


Start with the search bar


https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQh36.png

Start by typing your query into the search bar. Try to include as many relevant keywords as possible. The search subsystem intelligently performs a textual search over the entire collection of questions. Experiment with variations on keywords and formation of query.


Browse through the search results


https://i.stack.imgur.com/5kkgc.png

Browse through the presented search results to see if any one of the pre-existing question matches your query.


Advanced Search Tools


https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJvYD.png

The sites provide access to advanced search operators using which you can quickly sift through the relevant result by specifying tags, section to search, see only results with answer(s) etc.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/guwHK.png

As can be in seen in the above example, how using search tools have assisted us in filtering out irrelevant results and quickly arrive at the answer we are seeking :)


Auto suggestions

A simple but powerful search subsystem is built into the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/askask question UX. As you type the query title, potential matches are shown just below the text entry field. A number with green background indicates that the question has an accepted answer. Quite often, you'll end up finding answer to your query even before asking :)


Leveraging Web search engines


https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wgt2r.png

The entire collection of questions is crawled and indexed by Web search engines on an ongoing basis. You can also freely choose a search engine of your choice and use its available operator(s) to specify powerful search queries. This can be helpful if you feel Ask Different's built-in search is not yielding helpful results. Often, a lot of folks end up on https://apple.stackexchange.comAsk Different via a Web search.


Related questions


https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDxhs.png

Sometimes, even after extensive searching, you may feel that you couldn't find an existing query matching your concern. It is worth looking through the related questions shown in a column towards right. Repeated navigation through this section can lead to you better matches.


Asking question

If the extensive search operation hasn't yielded the desired query in the existing collection, it's time to go ahead and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/askask your question. For first timers it is advisable to understand what type of questions https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topiccan be asked and https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askwhat can't.

A friendly article explaining https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askhow to ask good questions is worth a read too.




This answer is meant to be a newbie friendly guide for discovering existing solutions to queries. A much detailed help article on https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/searchinghow to search is available for further perusal.

@NimeshNeema's answer is great, but I have often found better results by using Google search hacks. (He did mention this but I wanted to add an example).

I enter my question followed by an site:apple.stackexchange.com. See below:

We rolled out the new site theme for Ask Different. It is now live. 

What new theme?

If you're like, "What the heck are you talking about?", then you should read the Meta Stack Exchange post entitled https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themesRollout of new network site themes  (and maybe the posts it links to for the full background).

Your help needed

You are one of the first sites to get a new, unified theme. I https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3293/new-ask-different-site-theme-coming-soonpreviously posted the designs for theme in meta. The feedback given to that post was considered prior to rolling out the theme. Please help us look for issues/bugs and post the details (including images where needed) as an answer below. 

If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav then https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsivenessthis Meta Stack Exchange post is the right place for feedback. If you have issues with any functionality that is unrelated to the new theme, then please post a new question.

Let the mayhem begin :-)

With the left nav bar turned off, the top of the screen looks a bit strange IMHO:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/85Yv7.png

Maybe the distance between the top bar and the site logo/title is a bit too small, or there are just too many different fonts used in the various UI elements, or the white space around "Top Questions" is too big, hard to say. 

Could one of the UI expert have a look at this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would you like a custom “Cadillac” layout like the photo page to consume the white space around “Top Questions”? https://photo.stackexchange.com/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike looks much better, yes!


















It's all very ugly, isn't it? 

We've lost the nice Apple-specific font, by the looks of it, looks exactly like SuperUser now...
boxes round the headers, increasing the wasted space & drawing the eye away from the actual questions,
'Ask Question' stuck out all on its own
& lovely new yellow highlights for watched topics:/

Edit:
Long term I gave up on the yellow highlights altogether, unwatched all tags & ad-blocked the watched tag sections entirely. Too much yellow.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/heH4O.png

The themeless beta sites look better than the themed ones now

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qo7U2.png

...and, after comments, I just noticed more 'loveliness'
not only do we have the permanent grey upvote/flag icons I already moaned about,
we also now have 1992-style underlined links !

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGd4O.png

BTW, I only 'watched' a topic to get rid of this mess...

https://i.stack.imgur.com/DvD9h.png

& of course, I switched off the left-nav immediately.

Would it not have been better consolidating it with the already "full of random bits" right side?
It has precedent for being the space to fit all the bits that don't readily fit anywhere else - they have to go somewhere & that's as good as any, imo.

I did my own mockup... but it didn't take me long to realise all I was doing was putting most of it back where it was [& getting rid of the yellow] though I had to pull a lot of elements from the beta picture as they're gone from the site in their older form.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mDWC.png
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that the themeless beta will look like [codegolf.se] (the only beta site currently on trial)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah... so just as bad :/ I bet the guys on [Graphic Design](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/) will have kittens when it goes live on there. They currently have a nice font too, not the hideous squashed thing we've now been dumped with.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree - it's all lovely - the design is clean and crisp and there is light and space. What I wouldn't argue with is if your criticism is actually about less functional - and I'm certainly going to need to unlearn some habits and let my brain adjust to the new flow. Any change will be disruptive, but I'm thinking this will be better in the end for me but I can see how some might never prefer the changed flow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike - Honestly, I really hate it. The new font is crushed & blurry compared to the old. The left nav is a waste of space & once removed, removes functionality. The entire header is larger & more distracting because of the jumble of elements, yet contains less info/links. I have to say the recent top bar - the black bar - is much better than before, with the burger menu etc, but this new layout is not a forward step, it's a backward step.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "Ask Question" button should probably be a bit more obvious than in your mockup.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Left Nav function is in the hamburger menu when you hide it. It’s good to have opinions and express them - this is the place for very honest feedback. +1 Also - the burger menu animation is pretty slick but I can’t tell someone they’re wrong if they hate that visual effect and take it as affect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike - ugh, I didn't see that... & that's not the burger menu I meant. I was talking about the top right-most icon, which is kind of an SE-burger...thingy.


















To second bmike‘s idea of moving the „Ask Question“ button: At least on the iPad the button is in a very odd place if you look at a specific question. 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/DrAUH.jpg
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I find I'm hitting the ask button a lot in the new layout when I have no intention of asking. Time will tell if I'm just trained to not poke near where it used to be or if in fact this new design makes it too easy to tap or brush that button - especially on iOS


















Having Arial before Helvetica in the font stack feels very wrong for an Apple-oriented website.

Please join me in thanking all contributors for volunteering their time to make this site so great. We appreciate the contributions made by all users, not just those listed in this report! 

Keep up the great work! :)

Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have always wondered, how is @PeterJ 's account able to cast more than 40 votes in a single day (which as I understand is the limit for the total votes a single account can cast in a day!). Also, his account is the one which consistently has a high count for votes casted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JBis Every little bit helps! :) Thanks again for all your efforts, no matter how big or small you think they were!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NimeshNeema I was wondering when someone was going to notice/ask that! You're absolutely correct that we all have a limit of 40 votes per day, but the way it works is that if any of the posts you've voted on ends up being deleted on the same day, then you effectively get that vote back. For example, say you've voted on 40 posts today and then one of those is deleted (e.g. someone deletes their answer, a Mod deletes a post, etc) then you'll actually get one more vote up your sleeve for the day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for PeterJ, he spends quite a bit of time on [Charcoal HQ](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq), so I suspect his account is extremely active in voting down posts as SPAM and, as those posts get deleted, he gets more votes (this is an educated guess - not even Mods can identify what posts a user votes on). Anyway, over the course of a month, those extra votes add up. So, nothing *dodgy* going on (not that you were implying that!), it's just one way he's an active contributor to the site. :)


















This bug happens when you disable the sticky ness for the top navigation bar in your site preferences. 

Then, search for any user on the main site or meta logged in as a moderator. I do hide the left nav and this doesn’t happen when I log out. I also hide left nav if you want to reproduce this. 

Any user page breaks the layout as do edit history links:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/337222/revisionslinks to edit revisions that break layout.
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/5472/bmikehere is my user profile breaks layout 


Note that every user profile renders broken, this isn’t about one or a few profiles but all user pages on the site. Similarly, every edit revision page is broken, not just the one sample linked above. 

The top navigation shows a noticeable white space gap approximately 10% of the width of the page.

Safari on iOS 11.4.1
Safari on iOS 12.0
Firefox Focus 7.0.2 on iOS 12.1 with default settings for the browser


I have disabled all content blockers / safari extensions and verified this breaks on multiple networks (work / home / library / coffee shop) and that it’s only when I’m signed in and on a subset of pages like user pages listed.

My best guess is content blocking that browsers are applying is breaking the layout.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am pretty sure all browsers on iOS are wrappers of WebKit. So the same thing should happen on all browsers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The wikipedia page for it says it uses the deprecated [UIWebView API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwebview) instead of [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) @JBis - you're correct it's all likely the same renderer and this is now explicitly about content blocking and the site choosing cross site scripting in the fundamental design and how some end users will download what they think is a "browser app" and "see some things break".


















Ironically, I think it would be a good idea to auto-block titles that contain all (or most) capital letters.  The obvious idea of doing this is a cheap way to attract more attention to the one's question. This is wrong and shouldn't be allowed.  Most of these question will be quickly edited, wasting peoples time. 

I have two possible ways we could implement this but I encourage anyone with any other ideas to edit in or answer a proposal 


Auto Capitalize: If a question is submitted with an all capital title the question title should automatically switch to Capitalize formatting (every word's first letter is capitalized while the others remain lowercase, like the Right Click > Transformations > Capitalize on Macs.)
Warn OP: When submitting a question that contains an all capital title, the OP is blocked from submitting the question and a warning indicating that "The title cannot contain all capital letters.". They are not able to submit the question until it has been fixed.


This should also be added to the help center.

YES WE COULD. I’d say we don’t need the hard block and  I enthusiastically agree with everything else you propose. 

Most of this is covered in a post on the main site about quality filters on questions:


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/121301/block-questions-in-all-capsBLOCK QUESTIONS IN ALL CAPS


All caps is a valuable signal as is poor writing as are overly long and overly short posts. It lets us know the frame of mind and thought process of the person posting at the moment they entered the text. 

Also, I dislike technical solutions to people problems in general and in specific here. 

One thing I would support is a style guide extension to be written in [help] and perhaps summoning that and asking if the person realizes they are violating the style guide. 

I would add the style guide to the bottom of this article or link to it from there.

Not necessary.
Such a script, well quite similar, is already running: https://charcoal-se.org/SmokeDetector

How does it work?
Warning: technical programming details ahead.
SmokeDetector sets up a websocket connection to the same feed that powers the Stack Exchange realtime page. This websocket provides us with the feed of posts to scan.
Every time a post comes in, we grab the full details of the post from the Stack Exchange API. Requests are bundled up wherever possible to save on our 20,000 requests per day API quota. Once we have the details, including the full text of the body, we run the post’s body text, title, and owner’s username through a whole load of tests, including several miles of regex (not literally) to determine whether or not the post is spam.
If we determine that the post is spam, we post a report of that fact to Charcoal HQ (and to some other chatrooms, based on certain conditions). This report is the cue for some humans to go and look at the post, check if it’s spam, and flag it if so. This gets spam posts destroyed quickly. Those humans can then feed back to SmokeDetector to say whether the report was correct or not. We store this feedback in our web dashboard, metasmoke, which is itself complex enough that it’s a story for another day.
Since early 2017, we also have the possibility to automatically flag a post on behalf of volunteers who signed up for autoflagging. A post will never receive more than four of these automatic flags; we want to make sure every post is also reviewed by humans.

As you see, full automation is not wanted, and in my opinion should not be implemented.
Lacking the reputation or tools necessary to see more of what's going on behind the scenes: this community is not lacking in very zealous members doing the flagging and deletion. The immune system is working well, perhaps too well already.

It has been removed now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is great detail on Charcoal - I’ll add the spam ram and quality filter in another answer rather than hijack this answer with a big edit. +1


















There are several quality filters and automated tools / heuristics that are designed to prevent the most basic posts that one might characterize as unredeemingly bad.


Quality filter stops posting entirely
https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/336288/how-does-stack-overflow-handle-spammers/336289#336289Spam Ram then attacks spam head on as part of the site (it blocks known spamming sources with the data fed in the flagging step that is next)
Automated https://charcoal-se.org/“Charcoal” filtering and auto-flagging then tries to mop up the rest. This uses API and is external to the site. In the end, this flagging feeds the Spam Ram to hobble known spammers with post throttles and/or blocks.


When you see a post, it's almost certain that the post has passed the bar that was set and not that the tool is broken. There are https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305338/2017-a-year-in-spam%20%E2%80%9C2017%20A%20Year%20in%20Spam%E2%80%9D“2017 - A year in Spam” posts on the main meta with details how this works.


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/305338/2017-a-year-in-spam2017: a year in spam


We have the third highest absolute total spam posts that get by the filter. 

+------------------------------------------+------------+------------+
| Site Name                                | Post Count | % of Total |
+------------------------------------------+------------+------------+
| Stack Overflow                           |      10220 | 21.3624%   |
| Ask Ubuntu                               |       7058 | 14.7530%   |
| Ask Different                            |       4353 | 9.0989%    |
+------------------------------------------+------------+------------+
YAY US! :-( not...  


The problem comes when the filter is cranked up to stop more posts that get by and then looking at the false positives and harm to the site when legitimate posts get blocked.

So, TLDR:


Does this exist today? YES - there are three layers of filter on all sites in Stack Exchange
Should the filter be changed?  The best place for that detailed question might be on the main meta in https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/quality-filterquestions tagged as quality-filter


Sadly, the tools and people just react to the filters to keep getting things by.

As you say it’s only a few that get by - I’ll flag though - not downvote like some...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SolarMike I’ll edit the post - it was a few percent of the total that got past. So if we have 10,000 spam attempts a month - that would be 100-300 get by the quality filter requiring charcoal to cast the first few automatic flags and then someone else to manually flag or see it in a review queue. You are correct - flag and move on is the best.


















This site suffers from overzealous community reviewers and trigger happy close voters. This can be exemplified with one of my recent posts:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/333898/is-there-any-objective-data-on-apple-laptop-hardware-reliabilityIs there any objective data on Apple laptop hardware reliability [on hold]

Of course it might probably be argued that there might be certain problems with that post. One problem may be that this is a topic that violates religious convictions and is taboo for discussion? Perhaps there are even objective reasons to evaluate the question as "bad"?
But if those problems are there, why are there no comments suggesting improvements?

The only (indirect) comment from the close voters, except my note of protest, is the reason given in the post notice that it was


  put on hold as "too broad"    
  
  Please edit the question to limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer. Avoid asking multiple distinct questions at once. See the How to Ask page for help clarifying this question.


This question is not "too broad". Without a further commentary – especially from the close voters – on how to limit the question: how could this even be narrowed down further?

As I already wrote in a comment on main:


  This question is judged as off-topic because 4 other members do not want to improve this question and comment in that direction but they just want to kill it.


No comments suggesting improvements, just the naked close hammer is not "be nice".  

And those four members did that voting uniformly and not constructively and that was plain wrong on top. 

Four community reviews in such a quick succession, all with the same wrong reason and without constructive comments leave me no other choice as to conclude that this is an example of robo-reviewing (bandwagon lazyness?).

My reasoning for sorting the initial question into the "valid" box:
It is about Apple hardware, asks for a very concrete problem that should be answered with objective data, explicitly steers systematically away from "primarily opinion based", it is not "recommendation" (to the contrary: it's intended as a fishing lesson to avoid that as well) and does not ask "why" but "how" (as in 'how to get a realistic picture of reliability').
It is narrowed down to just one type of hardware from a limited time-frame with a very limited set of possible machine types to consider (SandyBridge, Retina, Touchbar the main differentiators); so it is basically just one data-set for a small range of machines that are seen by consumers and marketed by Apple as essentially the same across all those years and models.
The comments that are below the question already indicate that it can be answered, even if perhaps not with the kind of data I originally envisioned (as is common for answers: "do not do that, try this instead").

I fully expect the possibility that it might still be seen by some as "a bad fit for the site"; or as I like to phrase it "just unwanted".

But now a comment and an answer to this question suggest that "too broad" would not be the reason those two posters would have chosen. This just enforces my impression that all closers ticking just one "too broad" box is indicative of a problem, a problem perhaps with the initial question, but very well maybe even with the review process as it unfolded here. 4 quick votes just choosing the same checkbox indicates either a clear problem that fits that  box, or if does not fit that box, like it does not do here, something else.

Without direct feedback from the closevoters or access to the data "time spent to read and review and vote" this will remain guesswork?

It seems to me that this exchange needs more of this:
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/157121/what-are-review-tests-audits-and-how-do-they-workWhat are review tests (audits) and how do they work?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does this post's status suffer from wrong close reason and is indicative of robo reviewing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is symptomatic that the tag community-moderation does not exist. But why can't I use the tag "review"? It's always changed to review-page. Is that a synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this up in meta. I remember a couple times in the past where people really did a lot of work documenting things and got tons to "too broad" closes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that it is not too broad, there is also another issue - I think the original is off topic as it asks to find an off site resource and it could be that all but the first voted for that. However the wording of that reason give a reason as it might cause opinionated answers but I don;t see how in this case. I suspect the wording of the close reason might need cleaning upb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think Monomeeth and I want to try and edit the main post down. Can you put down an objective measure of what hw reliability would be in an answer here. Then one of us (or several of us) can edit and really trim the post down so that's it super clear what narrow range of hardware is contemplated - what "reliable" means. If you don't care about battery life - leave that out - if keyboards is primary - focus on that. If you want complete hardware repair data - you can certainly ask for that and I'm sure someone can explain why they feel that trade secret will likely never get out, etc...


















I've had a look at your original question (including the full timeline) and thought I'd share my thoughts even though I wasn't one of the close voters.

Is it on topic?

I recall reading your question not long after it was posted and thinking to myself that it was probably off-topic for the following reason:


  Questions asking to recommend or find a Mac, book, tool, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit this question to describe the problem and what research has been done so far to solve it. 


The above close reason is further discussed in this meta post: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254393/what-exactly-is-a-recommendation-questionWhat exactly is a recommendation question?

Now, as a Mod I have a binding close vote, so this is something I generally exercise only in clear cases, preferring instead to let the community decide (which is what I did in your case).

I've now reviewed the flags and each of the four close voters selected the "too broad" reason for closing. Obviously I can't comment on how much individual consideration was given by others (and therefore whether they were being "trigger happy"), but I do wonder whether the "broadness" relates to your terms of reference (i.e. MacBook Pros produced from 2011 to 2017). Clearly, that's a lot of MBPs your lumping in the same basket.

I guess this is where part of your frustration comes in, namely that none of the close voters offered comments suggesting improvements. So we can't be certain on why any of them felt this particular question was too broad.

Personally, I think you're asking an interesting question, but I'm not certain it's actually on topic here.

Wrong close reason?

As I mentioned above, all four close voters selected the same close reason. So this isn't a case of all the close votes being lumped with the first close reason. What I mean is that when a question is closed by the community, those close votes can reference different reasons but the system will only show one of them in the close notice even though the reasons may have differed. In this case, all close votes agreed on the reason (so I guess I'm in the minority as to what I see as being the main problem with your question).

Robo-reviewing

I do think that Ask Different like all SE communities does suffer from robo-reviewing from time to time. 

However, it's not clear to me that's what has happened here. Your main evidence seems to be:


  Four community reviews in such a quick succession, all with the same
  wrong reason and without constructive comments leave me no other
  choice as to conclude that this is an example of robo-reviewing.


According to the timeline, the close votes you're referring to occurred in a span of 1hr 21mins between the first close vote and the fourth close vote. That may seem to be in quick succession, but I've seen questions closed within a couple of minutes of being asked, so in comparison this wasn't quick.

As for the close reason we've already covered that, which leaves us with the lack of constructive comments.

I tend to agree that in the case of this particular question having had some comments would have been helpful. The main point (or focus) from which I think you were approaching your question is not one that can be easily limited down further to a specific problem. And my assumption that the "broad" reason was due to the large number of MBPs you were asking about is, at best, a guess. 

So while I agree having comments would have been helpful, and that an argument could be made that the lack of comments is not an example of "being nice", I don't think this is indicative of robo-reviewing.

Seeking clarity

One thing I would suggest to all users if they have a question closed without clear direction is to https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/askask about it here in meta or, if they have 20 or more rep, to pop into https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatchat and try pinging the close voters directly to seek clarification. Ideally this wouldn't be necessary, but at least it's a couple of avenues open to you and others.

From what I understand here, I guess 2 things: without knowing "time spent for review" this will remain guesswork. 2.: *You* also see the Q as non-salvageable?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC a great edit can salvage almost any post. Sometimes it takes two passes or two people, but I’m guessing there is one or two solid questions in the post, minimum. I’m just not sure which one you want to start with.


















Here are off source resource questions I believe should be closed:


Recommend the best book for high school Mac users
What list of iPad models is the most complete?
Where can I buy a twentieth anniversary mac?


Resource is there since we don't need to or want to list all the things that exist off this site in the close reasons.


Accessories
Songs
Ringtones
Photographs of people / machines / etc...
Things that would be a book if they were continued to several chapters like information listing / wiki articles / thoughtful blog posts on X


Are you struggling more with "resource" being too generic or that we should be closing things asking above in specific as well as in general?

The key to these being off topic is the faults listed specifically so that we can reopen these questions:


  Instead, edit this question to describe the problem and what research has been done so far to solve it."


By adding research that shows how someone failed to find what they are looking for, that almost always removes the close. Feel free to ping me or flag or raise in meta a list of any closed questions were the research to find that off site resource has enough research to be useful to others.

The problem is more about answers that gather a lot of spam "What's the best X" or are even asked as places for a spammer then to put their spam. I see this as a quality filter and bar to only let in good / useful / answerable questions about getting an off-site reasource, not that we just close all of these forever without a thought of how useful they might be by being specific and documented what the "ask" is.

Maybe we need a "How should I ask about off-site resouces?" guide similar to this one on how to ask about software recommendations. Recommendation questions are some of the hardest to ask so they are useful and aren't just "support me" lobs with not enough detail to even guess an answer.


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2180/5472How should I ask about getting a software recommendation? 

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Examples I agree with. I think an equivalent to "resource" should be found that makes it easy to *deduce* what it is meant by that from what is written out (as in [*ius positum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_law) as in legal positivism. Resource is *very generic* and may give rise to many complaints, as I read it. Signal words we agree on are "most/best": POB. Also list-type answers. But even that might be good if reasons/rationale are *required*. (Personal bias of course: I suffer more from closevotes as I suffer from seeing a Q fly that I think should have been closed.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, my latest Q had research, also around [help], a meta post and still tanked. In my view: primarily because of a wrong "too broad", but then here on meta it was dawned on me that "off-topic" might still be an issue with that. Hence a close reading, again, of that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Shoot me a link to your question or I can make a chat room for us if you don't wish to post it in main chat or here, @LangLangC - also - thanks for asking! My answer here is for many questions and not all of it may apply to your question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Gotta hit it for now, but it was around this [question](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3344/does-this-posts-status-suffer-from-wrong-close-reason-and-is-indicative-of-robo)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK - that's going to be a special case. The advice to show research is going to backfire there. I think I know why that was closed. Let's see if an edit to make it far less likely to draw some opinionated answers and you can then post much of your details in an answer stating your best guess as to how you see it, @LangLangC


















As I understand it new users cannot comment on a post for some reason but they can answer.

The problem is that new users are unfamiliar with the site and see a text box and type their comment unknowing of how this can disrupt the site.

Is it time for us to allow new users to comment, because it's easier to deal with disruptive comments being flagged than it is to constantly have the post: "Welcome to Ask Different _____! Unlike forums and other sites, this site focuses around the idea of questions, answers and comments, so it is preferred that answers are not used as comments. As a new user you can't yet post comments but this doesn't mean you should post them as answers, please consider removing your post for now."

Writing something like that is messy and confusing, and defeats the purpose of what the site is about.

Maybe I am wrong and people should comment in answers when they don't have the ability to comment, but I don't think that is what we want?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we fix the answers as comments problem?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi. I’m going to retag this discussion. Once we’ve mocked up what a consensus change would be, a followon proposal with concrete design would make sense. If you want to make an edit saying feature should be X, that’s fine too.


















Here’s a situation that’s totally opposite - a high rep user answers in comments: 


do the comments by jmh help or hurt?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/334369/can-i-print-3-years-of-texting-w-1person-without-screenshotsCan I print 3 years of texting w/1person without screenshots?


Is this one you might look to solve by fixing comments or would different tools and strategies attack each different use of posting? (And even if high rep users don’t use comments to improve the question - is the bar high enough for comments?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There does seem to be a need for a feature where a comment can be promoted to an answer by the original user or someone with suitable reputation, because there are plenty of times when people have commented "have you rebooted" followed by the user saying "Thanks so much that worked"... In this case it would be good to promote that as the official answer rather than reposting the same content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@unknowndomain Your example here "reboot" is a bad fit as it's usually borderline for improving the Q. (And usually not a real answer to a really good question anyway) For more elaborate answers in comments, read [here](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2306/251859), and keep in mind that it is considered  a good practice to use the comment's content and use it for your own answer, as it was a comment in violation of the design. I would wait a few hours and attribute the source, but that courtesy is optional.

As a first impression, this is… what now?!

https://i.stack.imgur.com/V4fJc.png

Four different header bars, an ad banner and a footer bar all competing for space, only the third of which tells me the site's actual title (Or is that another ad banner? I have no idea. ), and the actual page content I came for starts somewhere halfway down the screen sandwiched between lots of stuff I don't immediately care about.

This is quite a mess IMO.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are working on addressing this. See my comment on this [meta.stackexchange post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/314417/354333).



















  Unlike forums and other sites, this site focuses around the idea of questions, answers and comments, so it is preferred that answers are not used as comments. 


I guess that the first part of that is seen as a misconception. The correct/"official" take on this is "this site focuses around the idea of questions and answers". No comments at this stage. Comments do make this more like forum, especially if "abused". But comments are volatile, ephemeral and subject to deletion at any time. 

This proposal of lowering the comment privilege threshold would primarily increase the amount of comments, among that increase would also be bad comments. Bad comments are chatty, thanks, not about improving the the post they are under. That happens. I like some of those a lot since they provide a channel of communication not otherwise present. But it is frowned upon and contrary to the site's design. I guess a lowered threshold would likely tend to increase the problem. That does not mean I would be totally against lowering https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/214173/373864thresholds.

New users typing text into a wrong box is one problem, old users doing the same under different circumstances the other side of the same medal. It seems to me that new users that stick around are much quicker learners in that regard that "do not put comments into answers" is actually followed than older users that still "answer in comments".

I do not have that much insight on absolute numbers. Therefore I cannot estimate reliably how disruptive the problem you identify really is. But the current solution to it is flag the post for deletion or conversion into a proper comment. That's work for the mods. They seem swift about it.

If you strive to be really helpful to the new user and comment on "answers that are really just comments" yourself, teaching them the ropes, then your struggle with repetitive typing might e reduced by having a text snippet prepared for that occasion. That reduces the messiness quite a bit. It's then not typing but copying that bit you already wrote here.

But that would be probably a different problem? It might be of benefit to include an example of a comment in answer post that survived your flag in your question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@unknowndomain Please feel free to ask here in meta if you have some examples of flags we've rejected. We may be able to shed some light on why they've been rejected and it'd also serve to help educate others. As an aside, the most common flag I see users get wrong is the *Not an answer* flag. If you haven't already seen it, it may be worth checking out [Why was my flag for Not an Answer declined](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1629/why-was-my-flag-for-not-an-answer-declined).

I know that users are allowed to create second accounts but what are the rules on how those two accounts can interact or how they can be used?



For example, the two questions below were most likely created by the same person. The first question was closed as unclear.  And then it appears the OP created a second account, to bypass the moderation attempt, and created a very similar new question.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/334845/how-do-i-prevented-the-hackers-secret-intel-manipulating-my-terminal-againHow do I prevented the hackers (secret intel) manipulating my terminal again

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/335303/how-to-defend-against-this-zero-day-attackHow to Defend against this zero day attack?

Note: The second question is in a deleted status, so only high reputation users can see that content while it remains in a deleted status.



Questions


What are the rules on doing what the OP did? 
What are/aren't you allowed to do with two accounts?  
What should we do if we suspect something like this is occurring?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What are the rules on creating a second account?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's assume positive intent with respect to the referenced questions. I'm not going to redact them right now since it does help illustrate your question. I will say that I'm not going to post the contents of a deleted question - that is reserved for high rep users to see and if people wish to vote to reverse the deletion, that's the normal course of events to revive a deleted post.


















TLDR; multiple accounts for this OP isn't a concern at all and most of what's below has nothing to do with the person being asked about - it's just so you and everyone else has a very good feeling that the system is super resilient and having lots of accounts won't hide harmful behavior or violation of the terms of service here.

Answers


Make accounts as you please, but not to break the rules or evade limits the system places on your account.
Don't do anything you wouldn't / couldn't do with one main account.
Flag things when you're pretty sure something bad is happening - use the "other" flag to explain what you sense knowing that we'll hold this in confidence and react when it's clear something bad is going on.




There is no requirement to register for one or any question. It's up to an individual to request a merge in 95% of the cases per the help guide:


  https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/merging-accountshttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/merging-accounts
  If you have two accounts that you would like to join together, please sign into either account...


The only time elected moderators get involved is handling community flags on posts and when the automated systems trigger a warning and we generally need to refer unclear cases to the https://apple.stackexchange.com/contactcommunity manager employees as even we can't see who voted on any specific post and we only have limited access to select Personally Identifying Information (PII) of users that we have to go out of our way to access (and that access is strictly logged and auditable). This usually happens surrounding a flag that was issued in private and discussions in private as well as governed by the moderator privacy agreement 


https://apple.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreementhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/legal/moderator-agreement


Suspensions are temporary responses to specific conduct and limited in duration, forgive and forget in almost all cases. 


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/293213/why-we-dont-keep-public-records-of-suspensionsWhy we don't keep public records of suspensions
https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/06/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/06/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/


Rarely will someone continue to break the terms of service after being reminded patiently once or twice what the house rules are with respect to maintaining a correct and up to date account information.


  https://apple.stackexchange.com/legal/terms-of-servicehttps://apple.stackexchange.com/legal/terms-of-service
  • You are solely responsible for ensuring that your account registration is complete and remains up to date. 


If you look at the main meta, there are some cases where a suspension to investigate whether accounts are behaving improperly (sometimes referred to as sock puppet voting or targeted voting) but none of the above is relevant to the two links you posted above.

Hopefully this helps everyone know when to flag a post for moderator attention going forward.


The system has checks to prevent evasion of blocks simply by making a new account: https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/question-limitedhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/question-limited - making a new account won't help get away with this behavior.
The system has checks to detect abnormal voting patterns (and will just reverse the most blatant cases of improper voting without human intervention - we're just there for unclear / marginal cases that require a little human care and talking with the OP in question in private). Whether vote manipulation is for revenge or for artificially inflating reputation - making a new account won't help get away with this behavior. - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/57682/how-should-sockpuppets-be-handled-on-stack-exchangeHow should sockpuppets be handled on Stack Exchange?
The rest ends up being spotted super easily by all of you who have been around for a bit. When spammers get a feel that they can post their marketing material here, it's like crack and they can't stop and then they get caught. One off attempts to out-smart the systems remain one-off and aren't really a problem to be handled since they are one-off.


Feel free to ask more questions on meta or flag a post or two as "other" and ask a moderator to explain if you are flagging correctly. We won't divulge if we suspect someone is doing something wrong but we will escalate or handle it - that's our over-riding reason to be here and serve as elected moderators. To be a human and handle these exceptions, kindly, with compassion and patience and as a team collaborating so none of us has to be the only one running the show or deciding any of this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome answer! It's great to have all these links in the one place, and I think this really gets across how well the system works and the main role moderators play. :)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most Active Contributors Monthly Report - August 2018b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the query you use for these especially the close vote one? or better the Reopen oneb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark Actually, I don’t run a query, opting to use the advanced stats on the review queues instead. I import these into Excel and a range of formulas calculate a *score* based on all actions a user takes.

For example, let’s say two users (A and B) have reviewed Close Votes during the month. If they both reviewed 10 questions, but user B also added a comment on six of those questions and edited two others, then User B gets an overall higher score than User A. I take this approach as the idea is to recognise how *active* users are and *hopefully* encourage others to become more active.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On reflection, I have changed the "Reviews" label to "Score" on some of the metrics as that more accurately conveys what the value being displayed is. I’ve also changed the metric heading to better convey what we’re talking about (e.g.  "Most Close Votes Reviewed" has been changed to "Most Active Close Vote Reviewers"). Thanks for asking me about this, as I probably wouldn’t have thought to make these changes otherwise! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Edited "Jbis"→"JBis" :)


















I have suggested an edit to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192299Can I use GNU source in my iOS app? replacing the confusing use of "GNU source" and "GNU license" with "GPL license" throughout.

I believe this should clarify this rather straightforward question, without needing to further disambiguate which version of the GPL license the OP is asking about.

I am happy to suggest further edits based on feedback here!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please re-open GPL licensing question 192299b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would you put up an answer here so we can see what sort of straightforward answer might be needed? Perhaps I’m missing the obviousb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll do that - in the meantime, see my comment on the original question


















You have improved the question - it is now broader and my answer still holds as it is about GPL.

However you have not changed the reasons others voted it as off topic it is still a licensing question.

Also how do your comments differ from my answer?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5regarding licensing, are *all* licensing questions off topic? I saw an issue raised about jurisdiction which I don't think appliesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm struggling to see how it's too broad, should it specify GPL 2 or GPL 3?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5last point (thanks for your feedback) I addressed the dependency issue in my second commentb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I realise now that I could probably suggest an edit to your answer, I'll give that a whirl and see what you think


















Thanks for asking on meta for a discussion.

Your edit is pretty minor and I would put the iTunes connect tag back in since that’s the overall “service” that apple offers which makes this on topic here.

My hesitation to reopen is this second question - it needs to be gone or stated as a fact with references so it doesn’t look like there’s a side question that needs to be addressed first.


  Second, iOS does not allow 3rd party dynamic libraries, which means, to my understanding, you can't legally combine GPL and non-GPL code in one iOS app


What sort of answer would you be looking to add @d3vid? This seems much more suited for Stack Overflow since we are not at all a place to discuss code level questions and the license that governs code level decisions seems to be far more apt for developers.

I do get that we could have an answer that literally reviews the license / EULA / developer agreement and explains if Apple mentions anything about license directly. From Apple’s perspective, they may not even say anything except insist the developer is responsible for owning and licensing everything they use to sell.

Right now my Ask Different is no longer accepted questions from my account. Is there a way to override this or am I screwed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions are no longer being acceptedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Kudos to you for asking for help. I’ve added a constructive comment on your most down voted questions - those are the ones where multiple people in the community are saying your post wasn’t useful, or suggesting some research you could do. Feel free to post a new question for one or two of your questions if you can’t figure out how to undelete or edit them if you think there’s any we can help you with.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do understand that negative feedback can be hard to accept as helpful sometimes, so don’t worry if you want to do this post in a week or so - there’s no time limit to this and slow is the best way to go with a one post a week throttle in place for the near future.


















Yes you’re blocked and no you’re not screwed other than needing to figure out some posts, answer some content and fix some deletions.

Let’s go over all your deleted and closed questions and fix them up. the one that triggered your pause here was one that was pretty clearly off topic and you may have asked it here as you are in a rate limit or block on stack overflow as well. 


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/335540/decompiling-the-mac-kernelDecompiling the Mac kernel


That should be migrated, so please let us know (ping here or ask a new meta question) once you’ve sorted out your block status on Stack Overflow so we can migrate it there. Basically, deleting too many questions or having too many closed in a row (on average) is what slows you down either to one question a week or perhaps a hard block.

Once your existing questions are fixed - the system throttle will be lifted and you will be able to ask new questions. This is an automatic block based on patterns of acceptance on your account activity.


https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/86997/222623What can I do when getting "We are no longer accepting questions/answers from this account"?


In a nutshell - a deleted question is the most harmful to have. Don’t delete questions, let them be closed if you can. Fix them and get them reopened as then you can get votes to the positive so the community shows that you’re asking useful (to them at least) questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok so should I start with migrating that question to stack overflow? So migrating and deleting then asking in a different group is not the same thing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could we do a quick DM to clarify some things? Thanks for your help.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Cody Migration is where questions are moved to another Stack Exchange site — you shouldn't delete and re-ask a question somewhere else since that creates two questions and loses the history of the question. There's no DMing on Stack Exchange, but feel free to ask any questions about Ask Different you have in [chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat)!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is quite some important news bit in here. Searched on some metas and didn't find: "where is the exact outline for deleted content still counts for bans". Self-deletion of disapproved content sounds like the 'logical' solution, auto-deletion is not even under the control of a user… Is there more in store in terms of negative effects from deleted content?


















Here's my question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/335906/how-to-let-my-mbp-know-that-a-usb-is-bootableHow To Let My MBP know that a USB is bootable? . I just realized that my unanswered question is not on /unanswered, but many answered questions with over 10 votes and 4 answers are. I don't understand why this is happening.

(edit)

The question is recently answered, but the problem is still there.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My Unanswered Question Is Not On Unanswered, But Answered Questions Areb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Firstly, thanks for seeking help here on Meta! :) It might just be me, but I just wanted to clarify that I'm understanding the issue you're seeing. Are you saying that you're not seeing *unanswered* questions listed under the unanswered filter, but that you're seeing many *answered* questions listed there instead? Or...?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.


















When I go to https://apple.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=newesthttps://apple.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=newest, I can see your question:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/R03gE.png

There should be no exception for your own questions; it's not mentioned in the https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/18871/295232FAQ entry and I can see one of my own unanswered questions in the list as well. It is possible for a question to appear there even with 4 answers:


  The Unanswered Questions tab https://i.stack.imgur.com/R03gE.pngshows questions that have no answers with a positive score nor an accepted answer. (That includes questions with no answers at all.)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This implies I do not know why *you* didn't/don't see your own question. SE developers will notice this question since you tagged it as a [bug]; whether they will be able to provide an answer and solve it, I'm not sure. I can imagine this doesn't have high priority for them.


















How do I deal with an answer in comments that isn't an answer but not a dupe either?

I got this one - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/335949/creating-desktops-and-opening-programs-on-those-desktops-using-applescript?noredirect=1#comment433808_335949Creating desktops and opening programs on those desktops using applescript
Which I kind of read between the lines on & came up with http://xyproblem.infoXY Problem as a solution.
So I pushed in a comment to "answer to the X of the Y" which fixed it for the OP.

What next?

I can't close as dupe, cos it ain't a dupe.
I can't post as an answer 'cos it's not an answer to the question.

Stuck.

Should it just be left, long-haired, unwashed & unloved, to moulder in the compost of history, or given a short back & sides & recruited to the 'link underground' of efficiency?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I deal with an answer in comments that isn't an answer but not a dupe either?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: *"Should it just be left, long-haired, unwashed & unloved, to moulder in the compost of history, or given a short back & sides & recruited to the 'link underground' of efficiency?"* - I just love a lot of the descriptions you use! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does my answer help at all? Let me know here if I'm off the mark as to what you're looking to make as consensus or work through more questions.


















Someone should put up an answer there. It’s great the comments are there for someone to maybe read, but one or two answers would be best here. 

There’s always an answer if you can explain the way to do something even if it’s not the something the OP wants or initially thought they needed. Questions are just the excuse to get up answers so always focus on the good and useful answer, the rest can get fixed later with edits or closing as dupe. Be sure to vote up the question - it becomes good based on having a good answer even if objectively it wasn’t good initially and needed edits and comments to become vote worthy and get some answers. 

Here's an example - I don't even try to answer the actual question other than to reframe the issue a bit and offer workarounds.

It did help the OP achieve his goal, though it isn't at all an answer to the question he actually asked ;)


















I'm gonna leave this pretty short because its pretty self explanatory.  https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/iosShortcuts was recently released by Apple on iOS 12. I think we need a tag. I have enough rep to create the tag, but a tag for "Shortcut" already exists. Can we please create this tag?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please add a new tag "Shortcuts"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wanted to bring this up anyway, thanks for the question. The "shortcut" tag currently is used for keyboard shortcuts, having both "shortcut" *and* "shortcuts" will probably confuse people. Let me do some quick analysis on their use, will add a proposal below.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the meantime, can you add your proposal for excerpt/description of [tag:siri-shortcuts]?


















Previously, AskDifferent has been confined to asking programming questions relating mostly to AppleScript, Bash, and Automator as per the help section. But recently Apple has released the https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/iosShortcuts app in iOS. The Shortcuts app has multiple actions that include other languages currently not on-topic. Should we start to allow questions relating to these new topics that were previously considered off topic? Here are some of the topics:


Creation and editing of JSON files
Creation and editing of XML Files
Python Programming language
JavaScript Programming languages
Connecting Shortcuts to APIs
API Key's


and much more...

If we agree on allowing these questions then this will turn into an additional feature request, requesting that we edit the help center.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow programming related questions now that Shortcuts has been released?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Excellent question for discussion. Once we have consensus a second feature request to propose specific language for any change or clarification to the help if needed would be great.


















The relevant part in https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask here? says


  Code-level programming questions (cocoa, LLVM, etc…) are off-topic here. We do encourage AppleScript, Automator, and UNIX shell scripting questions as well as how to use tools like Xcode for non-language specific tasks.


Extrapolating from here I would consider 


questions which ask for how to code some specific task in Shortcuts,
questions about using specific aspects of Python, JavaScript etc. within Shortcuts,
answers which use any of the scripting languages available within Shortcuts


to be on-topic.

OTOH general questions about Python, JavaScript etc. are still off-topic for AD (at least in my opinion). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm. So would a question like: *How to pass the text inside an element by its id into a variable in Shortcuts?* be allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jbis I would probably follow up with "This looks like an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info), so can you describe in more details which problem you are trying to solve here?" first :-). Besides that: yes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This answer makes a lot of sense. Most of what was asked should be on topic here since json and xml are part of how the system saves and logs configurationa plots and log data. [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) is a sanctioned service and Apple app that guides scripting. As long as there’s a clear tie to some practical problem, interpreted languages like bash and swift and JavaScript/AppleScript seem to fall in with macOS scripting being on topic here.


















Where are we coming from?
Currently we have

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shortcutshortcut with 557 tagged questions, described as


Series of one or several keys that invoke some software/os action when triggered by the user
A Shortcut is a series of one or several keys that invoke some software/os action when triggered by the user. Common known keyboard shortcuts in Mac OS X are for example Command+Q fie quitting an application, Command+W for closing a window or Command+C for copying some data and Command+V for pasting the copied data.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboard-shortcutskeyboard-shortcuts as a synonym of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard with 3686 tagged questions, described as



A physical device with buttons that allow characters to be entered
The keyboard is a means of interacting with a device, whether it be using a combination of keys to execute an action (see https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shortcutsshortcuts) or typing to produce sentences.


Some thoughts

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shortcutshortcut seems mainly to be used to ask for keyboard shortcuts (also https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shortcutshortcut is often used together with https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard), https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard covers both hardware and software/shortcut topics though. So just merging https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shortcutshortcut into https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard will lead to a loss of granularity.
Given the multiple meanings of the term "shortcut(s)" having a generic tag with that name will lead to confusion and wrong usage (as nobody seems to read tag descriptions anyway)


Proposal

Keep https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard as today
Break synonym link between https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboard-shortcutskeyboard-shortcuts
Merge https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shortcutshortcut into https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboard-shortcutskeyboard-shortcuts (and delete https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shortcutshortcut if possible)
Create new https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/siri-shortcutssiri-shortcuts
Provide helpful excerpts/descriptions for all three


Any comments, remarks, feedback?

And thanks for background.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I’ll propose a second way to leave all these alone and make a new tag for iOS-shortcuts or shortcut.app - I’ll see if I can find any stupyle guide references to see how Apple describes these functions or in KB documentation.


















I took a screenshot of my desktop image that I uploaded to here. It is a screen shot of the image on my desktop that I wanted to attach the first time. Why is it showing up as a Imgur.com website?



The Screen Shot 2018 10..AM that you see here on my desktop is what I uploaded on here to ask a question, when it uploaded it looked like what you see just above this.

I am not too sure on the correct protocol but in my opinion "How to"/Guide questions are good and should be allowed.  While it doesn't fit the Q&A style per se, the question could be asked in a way prompting the Guide response. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for posting an answer!  I would disagree on this.  I think there's plenty of 'how-to' sites, like Medium, that are better designed for that sort of thing.  I look at the SE sites as excellent QA sites; I have a problem and I know where to go to get a fix.  While how-to's are very useful at times, it doesn't really fit the SE format.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb While many other sites have good guides, I don't think most of them benefit from a community who can edit, vote, check, update, etc. the post to make sure it works and is accurate. I do think more people would agree with you on this though. :)


















Here's a list of questions to check after you've written a question (or to think about before you post your question):


Have you done some research before asking the question?
If your question doesn't document your research, are you sure it shouldn't?
Do you need to perform some basic troubleshooting first to try and isolate what is failing?
Can you reproduce this problem after a restart of the app or the system?
Are you asking several questions at once rather than discarding all side questions leaving one clear question to be addressed?
Have you explained what you've already tried to solve your problem?
Have you specified which Apple Product or Service you are using?
Have you listed your OS version and application version as a precise number and not just "the latest"?
If a program or script produces different results to what you expected, have you stated what you expected, why you expected it, and the actual results?
If your question includes scripting, have you included a short but complete script?
If your app or script doesn't run, have you included the exact error?
If your question is related to anything locale-specific (online stores, third party web sites, time zones or languages other than the default), have you stated the relevant information about your system (e.g. your current time zone or that your https://www.apple.com/ph/ios/app-store/App Store account is set for the Phillipines)?
Are you sure your question is about the actual problem you're having? That is, you are trying to solve a problem (X), and you think you have a solution (Y), but when it doesn't work you fall into the trap of asking about Y instead of X. For more info refer to https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problemWhat is the XY problem? 


Some further general advice that applies to any site (and not just Ask Different)


Have you checked that your question looks reasonable in terms of formatting?
Have you checked the spelling and grammar to the best of your ability?
Have you read the whole question to yourself carefully, to make sure it makes sense and contains enough information for someone coming to it without any of the context that you already know?


If the answer to any of these questions is "no", please take the time to fix up your question before posting.

I realize this may seem like a lot of effort, but it will help you to get a useful answer as quickly as possible. More importantly, this checklist helps ensure your question and any answers it gets will be far more useful for everyone. After all, the purpose of this site is to document useful answers for everyone and you, the one asking, gets a custom answer as payback for asking a great question.

If you solve your problem in the process, please go ahead and ask the question and then provide your solution as an answer (and not by tacking the answer to the end of the question body).

Don't forget that everyone who edits and answers here to help you does so out of the goodness of their heart. It's up to us when we ask to make their job as simple as possible so their contributions can help both you and everyone else that shares this community space.



This https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/260648/stack-overflow-question-checklistpost on Stack Overflow meta inspired me to copy unchanged some of the text above and adapt the rest of Jon's words for the specific nature of questions we get here that end up closed, down voted or where people just don't get a decent answer ever. Thanks to Jon Skeet and everyone here that moderates by flagging / editing / asking and answering.

Don't really understand: *Are you asking several questions at once rather than discarding all side questions leaving one clear question to be addressed?*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also can we add one about using the correct tags. Not too broad but also includes all relevant items.


















As you've mentioned in the question, the automated suggested edit bans are just that: automatic. I don't know the specific details of why the system chooses a specific amount of time, but this was indeed a 7 day ban.

It's probably an appropriate time to mention that as this is basically your third suggested edits ban, 7 days is to allow the reviewers to focus on edits that are more likely to be approved. Take this break from edits to work on answering and before you choose to edit, reflect upon your edits. If you have any further questions about an edit in particular, https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatchat or here on meta are great places to ask.

Thanks for bringing up this question in meta - it's the perfect place to discuss / work through this process.

After all, people could have edit permissions here and not there and vice versa. I did spot check three of the rejections for edits and I agree with that vote - the edits I saw were very minor - tag only or very plain formatting changes. Once the temporary hold lifts - try to look for post in need of a substantial edit so that you don't have to be slowed down next time.

So recently I got an email from Stack Overflow saying that I am in the top whatever percent of rep earning users.

What I found strange though is that it's from Stack Overflow, not Stack Exchange or Ask Different.

The email looks legit but I am not sure if it is and why it came from Stack Overflow.

The email:

  Tell the OP it isn’t possible in an answer and get downvoted


I'm not sure why you're operating under the presumption that saying "No" and/or giving a short answer automatically means a down vote.  This is not the case and I can site you several personal examples:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/304276/will-two-charging-cables-charge-my-laptop-twice-as-quickly/304278#304278Will two charging cables charge my laptop twice as quickly?

It's perfectly fine to say  "no" and providing a succinct answer is always best.


  Post an alternative that is easier and built in to the iOS system and
  get downvoted


There's nothing wrong with providing an alternative and it is highly encouraged to do so.  What I see wrong (IMO) with your answer is that it is literally a copy and paste of the Apple support document you link to in the beginning.   If you were going for "easier" a simple link to the support document would have sufficed.  

To me, this practice evokes an image like that of a student who copies and pastes 9 pages of source in a 10 page paper and cites it to remain compliant and "complete" the requisite assignment.  Block quoting what amounts to the entire answer is what leads to this perception.


  So I’m a bit stuck. What should be done?


What would have made this a much better answer is if you provided the salient details (probably 4 or 5 bullet points) you wrote with a link to the full source.   

Bottom Line...

A tech writer at Apple did a great job writing up that support document.  I up voted the question as it's a good one, albeit the answer is probably not what the OP wants to hear.  Your answer however, couldn't get an up vote from me because there was no originality to it (i.e. you translated it to lay terms so we could all understand it, or you summarized it so we didn't have to scroll 3 pages to get the solution, etc.).

Just my 2¢
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I added a sentence on a link to download it as that wasn’t included in the articleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You provided a citation link (not a download) which is basically a reference.  Your current edit makes this a link only answer which means if/when the link goes stale, the answer becomes useless.  Where's *your* contribution?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DManokhin Allan, it's not a link-only answer, it also answers the "is it possible" part of the question. Sometimes a link to a support article *is* the best answer to  a question, and the better-written support articles are hard do summarize without loosing essential information. One way to protect against link rot (which unfortunately also happens on support.apple.com) is to at least include the title of the support page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In quite a few SE communities, verbosity is practically demanded.  If the COMPLETE non-link answer fits in two sentences, you will be scolded if you don't add at least a paragraph of fluff.  I have so far refused to play that game—"if you don't like someone getting to the point, downvote."  And they do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@WGroleau - I agree with you...I prefer succinctness.  As for the hordes of S.E. down voters, we have our horde here too that love to down vote for no apparent reason.  In fact, I seen down votes *SPAM*;  rather than flag it as such which automatically down votes it without the cost.


















Yes. That makes an excellent merge. Would you be willing to proof read the wiki edit I make for accuracy?


https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/refind/infohttps://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/refind/info


I moved the old excerpt into the wiki tag body and then tried to fix the excerpt to indicate both tools belong to that tag. The distinction of what’s a boot manager and which one hasn’t been maintained since 2013 need to be edited in to the body for sure. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd be happy to proofread the tag wiki edit! (After this all gets decided, of course.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Huh, did they get merged already? I was going to edit the [rEFIt] description to point users to rEFInd, but this works too. Maybe I should edit back in "this tag should be used for both". (:


















I don't think this makes for a good merge. rEFIt and rEFInd are two different software, with the latter being a fork of the former, not just another release of the original software. It is unclear that question that apply to rEFIt would automatically apply to rEFInd and vice versa, and such should be kept distinct if this is the case.

In the same way old versions of macOS are superseded with newer versions and we want to encourage new users to use the latest version of macOS, that doesn't mean we invalidate all High Sierra questions making them Mojave questions by merging https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/high-sierrahigh-sierra into https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mojavemojave!

Is there any circumstance in which you might want to use it over rEFInd? If not, why not just redirect people to rEFInd instead?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Silver It's great to redirect new people to use rEFInd, but that doesn't mean retroactively making all questions on the site currently asking about rEFIt now about rEFInd, potentially invalidating existing answers on the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, that is a very good point. Should we suggest on the rEFIt tag to use rEFInd instead, perhaps?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Silver Such a message could go in the tag wiki excerpt

iOS has a feature to store credit cards, loyalty passes and things like a digital wallet or passbook.

Wallet seems to be the English name replacing passbook entirely a few years ago (around 3).

On the site, in December 2018 wallet is a synonym of passbook. 

The same applies to iBooks, it was renamed to Books and needs to be changed.

Should we swap the synonym so that the words wallet are the tag used?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename and synonym [passbook] tag to [wallet]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did my edit to change one of the directions make sense to you? Wallet replaces passbook and not was replaced by in my eyes - so I changed that sentence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I get your edit, it still means the same thing


















I'd support reversing this merge. Any objections or cleanup needed if we implement this?

There's only [34 questions](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/passbook) tagged 'passbook'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can the merge be implemented now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DaniilManokhin i would prefer this answer gets +5 to +10 but the majority of the moderators have approved so I will proceed. Let’s work on getting votes up on the answer to indicate broad support for tag cleanup going forward.


















It's indeed possible to answer a question which is put on hold, if you're still on the question page. You'll get a banner "this question is now put on-hold" and this will disable the 'Submit' button, but it's relatively easy to re-enable it via the developer tools of the browser. The server will still accept new answers for a few hours or so.

Not everyone sees on and off topic the same.

That's why we have votes and even a close or delete isn't permanent. I did cast a binding reopen vote to give that question a second chance and it's closed pretty quickly as off topic and I respect those votes as it's not a great example of an on-topic question.

Flagging is for very serious issues that require a moderator to take action and circumvent the normal process. As you can see from the history on that post - the normal voting process to close / reopen is sufficient here (and working quite well IMO) to handle this post so declining to take action just lets you know to use the votes and comments and not flag something that can be handled with normal votes. The moderators don't need to intervene in this case, hence the flag was declined.

Apple IDs can be protected by


the feature https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204152two-step verification (legacy), currently tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/two-step-authenticationtwo-step-authentication,
the feature https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204915two-factor authentication, currently tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/two-factor-authenticationtwo-factor-authentication.


Since the name of the legacy feature is ‘verification’ not ‘authentication’, I propose the tag for the legacy feature is renamed to reflect the correct name of this feature, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/two-step-verificationtwo-step-verification.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename [two-step-authentication] to [two-step-verification]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your grey tags are confusing to me. TSV matches STA in the first bullet. TFA/TFA match on the second bullet. Lastly you say TSV in the end - shouldn’t that be TSA?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike The grey tags are confusing due to the discrepancy between the name of the feature and the tag name on this site. I’ve attempted to clarify, hope the edit makes more sense?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Proposal as written makes sense to me!


















Apple calls this Two-Factor Authentication for all new sign up and all OS inclusive of iOS9 and El-Capitan or newer.

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201303https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201303

We need to keep that as the main tag. I would argue we merge two step verification into TFA and have only one tag. Please vote for this if you want this exact merge to happen. Other options (reversing the merge or keeping these separate - please post an answer to cover that option.


One tag of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/two-factor-authenticationtwo-factor-authentication

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with this since the two features are distinct. The separation of the tags is what lead to the correct answer given [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/345925/how-to-recover-apple-account-login-when-2-step-authentication-without-apple-devi) vs an incorrect answer which would have been given with the incorrect tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that the two are so similar and could remain unified, but conflating one with the other isn't a good thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I vote for the merge of both tags as Apple is *automatically* [migrating accounts from two-step verify to two-factor auth](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207198).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan ‘*…when you sign in to iOS 11 or later or macOS High Sierra or later*’, so for a family member with an iPad 2 and iPhone 3G that's never happening! Verification and authentication are distinct functionality and a possible migration path from Apple's implementation of one to the other does not mean the tags should be conflated imo.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grg I think we should have an answer here explaining why the tags should not be combined - confusion over which process to follow would be increased clearly so I’d like to upvote a “no - we don’t want this to be merged or linked or made synonyms”b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're talking about two products, one obsolete and another about to become "vintage" in less than a month with a service Apple is bound to kill off shortly thereafter.....if not now, in very short order, this will be a moot point.


















This functionality already exists. You can check how you have voted, but obviously not how others have voted.

To check your votes:

By default you should be on the Activity tab, but if you’re not, select it
If you look below the Reputation and Badges section you’ll see a number of tabs: Summary, Answers, Questions, etc.
Click on the Votes tab (usually the last one)
This will show you all your votes, including:


total votes cast
a list of all posts and how long ago you voted on them (if in the last 48hrs) or the date you voted for them (if longer than 48hrs)

Just a thought, as I do agree that "Ask Different" continues to become more and more obsolescent.

Years ago, I had a consulting company was called "...and Oranges, LLC". Kept me out of trouble with Apple, but people knew what I did, that's for sure. 

I'd gladly had over the trademark if people wanted to use it here. :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like you say, 'people know what it does'. Changing a well-established name now makes less sense than 6 years ago, even for people with no clue as to the history of the phrase.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah. This answer was mean as more toung-in-cheek support for keeping it than anything else. And really there's definitely something to be said for sparking that curiosity in those who want to learn.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice. Is your LLC Apples plural or singular?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, actually, the name was, literally, "AND ORANGES LLC" (as registered, I used the ellipsis in marketing). But the point was to avoid any trademark infringement, but still to imply the focus on Apple. So, neither.  ;)


















Bounties are rewards for finding answers, not for providing an answer fitting some narrow requirements not part of the original question. The bounty will be awarded at the end even if none of the answers meets your detailed requirements. 

Also: why is it important that an answer lays within specific parameters as long as it solves the question asked? There may be even better ways to solve the problem than the one you‘ve listed. If at the end you get two answers, one within the additional requirements and a much better one taking a totally different approach, which one will get the bounty?

Having said that I think just going with the standard reason of „Question has not received enough attention“ will be enough to create new interest for the question. 

PS: I assume you‘ve already checked whether the project mentioned in the answer has progressed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, you're absolutely right. This was really born out of my own frustration of spending four hours not being able to come up with anything satisfactory myself. The thing about Python 3 and the specific parameters is just that I'd like to see a tool that a non-admin user with strict SIP ("App Store Only") could use on *their* files, and adding another compiled interpreter means using unsigned code. But, I think if I just dump my dead end into my own *unsatisfactory* answer, just the standard "not enough attention" would be just fine. As you said, there may be totally different approaches.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And yeah, no progress on that project since the question first was asked.


















It looks like you've been tripped up again with a ban. If the system doesn't tell you the length of the ban - I would encourage you to ask here and we'll get an official answer why ban length isn't shown to the person being on temporary hold.

Going to the source of the hold - here are a few edits I agree should have been rejected and not proposed in the first place:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/254926https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/254926 (this one makes a lot of small grammar / rewordings and no improvement.

It seems your rejections are mostly for these reasons:


correcting simple typos on long detailed posts that the meaning is super clear - you're just dotting I / crossing T or changing the capitalization of iPhone / Iphone / iphone and not making a substantial improvement in the usefulness or organization or clarity of the post.
tag issues


making new tags and first tag summary
adding new tags to questions where the value of the tag istelf is questionable



For the first - you might just have to stop making minor edits if you keep getting reviewers who have high trust to reject them.

For the second - we can 100% help. Rather than editing a tag wiki - ask on meta to build consensus. Partner with a higher rep user that can make these changes and proof read your inputs.




https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/254927https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/254927 


I think the theory of tagging is something this meta doesn't get several people involved and in the case about lockscreen. I would argue we should burn that tag. I personally feel we don't benefit from making tags to catalog every single feature and every possible noun. There are some issues that should be worked out if we're adding new tags.

Why wouldn't we use the OS to categorize all lock screen questions. Wouldn't the lock on tvOS have different experts than iOS than watchOS than macOS? Basically - this tag - if it's created needs some consensus on what purpose it will serve.

There is a very clear rejection reason for tags to encourage this sort of collaboration:


  Tag excerpts amounting to, "[tag] is for questions about [tag]" are pointless and usually rejected. Excerpts should describe why and when a tag would be used.


Do both of these main points make sense to you?



Also - when you make an edit up to 4 people need to look at the posts and then if the edit succeeds - you're bumping a bad question back to the top of the queue so people are doing a good job rejecting the edits that are being rejected. Also, please don't take this as piling on, but since you've been in this hold a few times I wanted to spend some time to really dig into this for you and others that might think that making a bunch of quick edits isn't harmful if they get rejected by the reviewers.

This will be super useful for others as well, especially since quite a few fall into the trap of trivial edits. I also like that you've mentioned the fact that once an edit is successful it automatically promotes the question to the top of the queue, and this is something users need to be aware of - both in terms of how useful the question is, and also in terms of how many questions they edit in a short period - too many edits means that *new* questions can be drowned out in the queue and this isn't good for anyone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very good point @Monomeeth - One of these edits in a 24 hour period might be far less of a thing to "reject" but when it's 20 edits all in a queue and they all are marginal at best, I'm inclined to hit the pause button for a while.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see your points. I saw someone said once that “you will get very little accepts for edit suggestions on ask different” I have to say I agree. With the tag wikis are you saying that limited information is better than no information? Some may not know what low power mode is and in fact I did provide a sentence on its use. So what should be done when a post has some issues but it will get rejected? Just leave it then for people with more than 2k? A little edit is better than no edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DaniilManokhin - You've had 2 on S.O and now 2 here;  I'm having difficulty seeing how this is an A.D issue, but perhaps you could shed some light on it.  It's not as isolated as you think - [SE Meta Posts on Rejected Edits](https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=rejected+edit).  And finally, ***No!.  A little edit is not better than no edit.***  A superfluous edit to an existing question (especially older ones) moves the question back to the top of the active queue regardless how minor the edit.  Blitzing these edits in succession drowns out new questions.

I’ve had a quick look and it seems you’ve effectively (though unintentionally) created two accounts on Ask Different. I suspect when you first visited the site to ask your first question you created an unregistered account and then when you came back to ask the other question you ended up completing your registration which carried over an association bonus from your Stack Overflow account.

To resolve this you can ask to have the accounts merged as follows:


  I accidentally created two accounts; how do I merge them?
  
  If you have two accounts that you would like to join together, please
  sign into either account, visit the https://meta.stackexchange.com/contactcontact form and select ‘I
  need to merge user profiles’. After you contact us, the Stack Exchange
  Team will reach out to verify that you own both accounts. If we can
  confirm your ownership, we will initiate a merge.
  
  If you can't remember how to log in, https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/account-recoverygo here and enter the email
  address you used to create the account you are trying to sign into.

Once the accounts are merged (at this time of year, allow some time for this to occur) you'll be able to accept the answer etc.

I would argue that in this specific case it would not even have been necessary to delete it because it actually proposed a valid answer to the question asked.

I believe this is the correct answer. I've successfully use similar commands as shown in the article.

In the Stack Exchange community (and espically so in Ask Different) we have what I like to affectionately call "the voting horde."  And within this horde there are two factions, the "up vote brigade" and the "down vote posse."

I have literally seen questions which were not only off topic for having nothing to do with Apple products but actually make no sense receive what seems like the "automatic up vote" and answers which are well thought out and reasoned get down voted faster than quick.

It's the nature of the  beast.  

It's happened to me several times as it's happened to countless others.  Don't allow it to discourage you - just put in your best and honest effort and pay them no mind.  Your efforts will speak for itself and don't worry, veterans like myself will share with you what we find wrong (and in many cases what's right!) in your post (without the down vote, ironically).

Don't forget, it takes 5 down votes to cancel one up vote.  

There's an old adage that I heard years back that applies to situations like this:

It takes a craftsman to build something, but any mule can knock it down.  

As for what's wrong with you post?  

Nothing. Keep being the craftsman.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Statistically you rightly observe that brigade and posse cancel each other out for most of the posts and rep-hunters remain comfy (HNQ-effects excluded). But apart from really deserving posts the posse makes life miserable and *really* destroys some functionality here in that 'good' or 'OK' answers *do not* rise-to-the-top as fast as they could or should. Grumpy posse would not be that much of an issue here, and that one is biiig, if more people (eg veterans, nudge, nudge) would vote more, and vote more positively, if appropriate.


















Multitasking is using several apps at the same time. 

Whereas background app refresh is the app refreshing in the background even when not in use.

Why are they synonyms?

It's running several *tasks* at the same time, thus the name.   Background refresh, by it's very definition is performing a task *in the background* (like fetching email) while in the foreground something else is happening (like surfing the web).


















Many times, https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/325547/119271OPs are good enough to link videos to their question(s) so that we can have a view of the problem they are experiencing.  The only problem with this is that it links to a video off of Ask Different.  The solution (in most cases, there's no audio for example) is to create an animated GIF so that the picture is "in line" with the question and not an external link.

There's a https://superuser.com/questions/556029/how-do-i-convert-a-video-to-gif-using-ffmpeg-with-reasonable-qualitygood answer on SuperUser on how to do this.  However, I wanted something that could automate this process as the commands are a bit onerous to remember each time.  

My goal was to do this with as few 3rd party utilities as possible and to automate it so that it provided a good quality animation while respecting the 2MB image limit.

You will need https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg and the script below.  You can call it whatever you like (I used ffmp4gif); and make sure it's in a directory in your path.  All operations will be done in the current directory.

It takes a single argument, that being the input filename.  For example:

$ ffmp4gif foobar.mp4


This will create an animated GIF with the name foobar.gif in the same directory.

It's a pretty cut and dry script... feel free to make/suggest improvements.

It doesn't answer the question, in part because the question doesn't make sense.  (I just attempted to write my own answer, but as I explained within it, I'm stuck guessing what the asker is trying to do.)  There are numerous hints in the question and subsequent comments that the asker found the wrong command for the job.  The command they're running does something completely different from what they want to do, so asking why it's taking a long time isn't useful.  When they try your command, it's still not going to do what they want.

There are some terminology issues with your post.  I wouldn't warrant that worthy of a downvote--yes, bs actually stands for block size, but it probably also affects the buffer size.

It's definitely not a great idea to pipe dd directly to another dd process, though I see where you got the idea; in your example, you've got another command in between.  However, the example provided by the asker indicates that there's no need for an intermediary command--or, at least, that would be what it indicated if they were on the right track, which they're not.

When someone asks the wrong question, answers are inevitably going to be controversial.  Opinions vary widely on how you should proceed.  Some would rather that ignore the discrepancies and attempt to answer the literal question, thereby helping people who arrive from search engines.  Others would rather that you read into the asker's intentions and provide an answer that helps the asker, rather than people arriving from Google.  Still others want you to leave a comment and downvote the question.

In this scenario, there's no winning answer.  You can see that my answer was almost immediately downvoted.  It's probably going to continue to get downvoted.

Edit: I just saw someone mention the term "http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblemXY problem" elsewhere on AskDifferent.  It's a pretty fitting explanation for the problem here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can only repeat what I commented on your answer already: If in doubt, add a comment, not a answer making too many assumption. Or flag for mod attention. Or just ignore it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And remember: There are no wrong questions. There may be questions though which are not as clear to understand to the reader as to the writer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The threshold for “too many assumptions” is fairly subjective; it also varies by community. On Stack Overflow, answers like that are common because people often don’t ask the right question. Sometimes it’s impossible to tell what they’re trying to do, but when there’s a reasonable guess to be made, there’s no harm in posting an answer. The answer I wrote wouldn’t have fit in a comment, it does answer the literal question (“how long should it take?”), and it attempts to provide additional help. (Note that OP didn’t ask how to speed it up, only how long it should take.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are definitely wrong questions. If you’re trying to do X, but you ask how to do Y, and Y can’t lead you to X, it is quite objectively the wrong question. It could still be a valid question, but the asker probably isn’t going to appreciate a valid answer. My general approach there is to provide both the valid answer and “If you’re trying to do XYZ, you may need to ask a different question”—otherwise, they’re just going to be frustrated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"If you’re trying to do XYZ, you may need to ask a different question" is something not everybody appreciates, especially if they *want* to do XYZ and believe that they asked the right question already.

Different sites have different shapes badges according to the theme:


Travel has a map pointer 
Android has an Android icon
English Language Learners have bookmarks 


So why shouldn’t our badges be shaped as some sort of Apple Logo?

I understand we might not be able https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.htmlto license the exact Apple logo shape, but please put up a design or drawing so we can all vote for options we like (or dislike) and see if there is a design the community would support.

This CSS patch can be applied as a user style without userscript extensions, in Safari preferences for example. You may need to prepend more specific selectors if you use the global user style sheet and have conflicts with other sites.

Because - believe it or not - you still earn reputation on Meta; it is just not shown and the main site's reputation is shown instead. Each upvote on an answer counts as +10 towards these badges, and each upvote on a question as +5, just like they would do on the main site.

If you track the Epic or Legendary badge in your (Meta) profile and click on the progress bar, you'll see that you earned some 'virtual' reputation on Meta today. Since this Meta is not so active, these badges are very rare. They're more common on larger Metas like https://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/badges/43/legendary?userid=4751173Stack Overflow's.

On a practical matter, moderators can't intervene in this so if you felt this was a bug and you wanted a developer to review / manually award the bounty - please use the contact us link and refer to this post.

If it's just about making sure you were looking in the right place, here is where would expect to see the button on Safari without any content blockers engaged: below the voting triangles and the green check mark. 



Don't worry about the clock icon - that is NOT the bounty award, and it's relating to moderator tools to see the history on the post. The bounty award is large and colorful (dark blue like the offer bounty button in my experience)

It should be next to “if you...” since there are anither 5 hours left in the grace period. (4h57m and counting down)

You can only award it to the single answer.

They might be able to help you award the bounty if that's the reason why you asked here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just fyi, the "bounty ended" event in the timeline is *after* the grace period. Those events are not created until the grace period was over and the bounty was formally removed from the question. It was over 2 days ago and cannot be awarded.


















The bounty grace period for that question started on Jan 14 at 8:17, which was exactly 7 days after it started. You were emailed about the grace period being active on Jan 15 at 0:00 (which is the scheduled task that looks for bounties in grace period mode and emails all users about it). The bounty was formally removed due to an expired grace period on Jan 15 at 10:02 and could no longer be awarded at that time.

I've no idea why you would've gotten an email that was sent over two days ago just today. It's possible you just didn't notice it until now, or your email client was holding it up somewhere. But the system functioned as intended here and there's nothing to fix.

Unfortunately, we're not able to manually alter the state of bounties and this question will just have to go without a bounty award.

So maybe the email was stuck in a queue somewhere (or Google had a problem). Thanks for the investigation anyway, that's good to know the system is working fine!


















It appears that new (as well as some old) users on Ask Different do not blur out/hide the device serial number when posting screenshot as part of their question.

While some may argue if sharing device serial number publicly is/is not harmful, this act is generally accidental on authors part due to ignorance.

What should be the recommended approach in such cases?


Should other users/moderatos proactively edit the post to hide the serial number?
Should the original author be notified about the visible serial number and be requested to take corrective measure(s)? (Deleting and re-posting for e.g.)
Should the moderators be flagged to remove the serial number from the edit history?


Additionally


Should serial numbers be redacted?
What harm does it cause to leave serial number in visible text?


Kindly share your thought(s) so that a standardized approach can be formulated to handle such cases.

Is posting a serial number harmful or “ list the harm this causes”  - I’m curious what you see as the harm in leaving that up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that a simple edit will not remove the number as old version of the post are still readable. I think mods only can really do a redaction


















Thanks for raising this. I've also noticed the same thing, but don't find it to be a concern. 

You've asked a few questions, so I'll provide my brief views below:


  Should other users/moderatos proactively edit the post to hide the
  serial number?


No.


  Should the original author be notified about the visible serial number
  and be requested to take corrective measure(s)? (Deleting and
  re-posting for e.g.)


No. I don't think we should be telling them to take corrective action for something that in reality poses very little (practically no) risk. I guess I could see an argument (maybe/maybe not) for letting the OP know their serial number is visible in case they weren't aware, and that should they have a particular concern with the idea of their serial number being visible, explain that they can choose to edit their post.


  Should the moderators be flagged to remove the serial number from the
  edit history?


By users generally, no. By the original author? Yes, but only if they're concerned about it, no need otherwise.


  Should serial numbers be redacted?


No, unless the original author has requested a redaction.


  What harm does it cause to leave serial number in visible text?


I think this should be dealt with as a separate question as it's potentially opinion-based and could invite lots of views/answers. I also don't think it should be worded as "What harm does it cause", but rather "What harm could it cause". [I think bmike is going to post a separate question on this].

Without going into details here, my answer would be to say that there's essentially no harm, but in an absolute worst case scenario there are a couple of possible ways someone could try to use a serial number (but not in a way that causes harm to the original author). In fact, the only circumstances I can envisage a serial number being manipulated in a way that could cause harm to the original author involves someone who is both familiar with some of Apple's internal processes and also has access to personal details about the original author. An extremely low risk in the context of our site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's also possible for a serial number to cause harm if someone knew a person in real life *and* knew the serial number of their device. This would allow them to make a connection between a person's real life and online personas... but honestly, that's something for the author to think about, not us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Undo Yep, I guess that's a possibility. It's another example of my point that a person really has to have *access to personal details about the original author* to cause what I would call *harm*. But of course, what causes 'harm' is highly subjective. Regardless, you're right - it's something for the author to think about. As far as I can tell, at most we *may* consider pointing out that a screenshot displays a serial number on the off chance they're not aware. It's up to them then if they want to take some action.


















2019 is here! And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of Community Promotion Ads! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting apple related open source apps
the site's twitter account
script packs or power tools
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/3463here.

When creating a post, we would recommend that the locale be removed from URLs so that a user's preferred locale is default. An exception is if you have a question where the locale is key to the problem to be solved.
For example the localized and delocalized versions of the links you posted,

https://support.apple.com/en-gb/ios/update
https://support.apple.com/ios/update



https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306
https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204306



https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=…&language=GB-EN
https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=…

If you don't know what the locale-generic version of the page is, check if there exists a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element#Examplescanonical link.
https://i.stack.imgur.com/IacH0.png
The true generic version is the ‘kb’ link, or more recently none at all (thanks @Tetsujin), which automatically redirects to your preferred locale. The canonical link is to help search engines index the correct version of the page, which in this case Apple has selected as the en-us page. You should use the canonical link if you don’t know what the locale-generic version of the page is.
In the case of such a specific link with many parameters that may be time-specific or session specific, or where a locale can't be removed such as specific support pages, link to the previous page's canonical and explain how to navigate to the destination. This helps prevent link rot where the destination page is frequently updated.
Locales in links not a reason to mass edit posts to remove the locale. If you’re editing a post anyway to make substantial improvements or clarifications, then please fix the locale and everything else minor and major that needs tidying up.
Unless a localized link fundamentally breaks a question or is broken itself, this should be strictly followed only when you are crafting your own posts before publishing it.

With the interesting title it probably attracted a lot of views (and votes).


















The effect you see is (almost) entirely due to the question being on the https://stackexchange.com/Hot Network Question list. In the box on the top right, you see that it has been viewed over 10,000 times (as I write this).

https://i.stack.imgur.com/5BT4R.png

This is not a normal number of views for a question that's not even three days old; https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=newest&page=3most other questions of that age struggle to reach 40 views. (Some of those 10,000 views have come from Twitter, as @nohillside mentions, but those are mostly anonymous users who can't vote.)

Even for a Hot Network Question, it seems to be very lucky. That doesn't really surprise me; it has got a title that's easily understood by users to be a nice 'challenge' they probably never thought of but like to know the solution to. Think 'clickbait', but without the negative connotations. That's why many users click on it, some upvote the question and the answers, and the question https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/60756/295232stays hot for a longer time, leading to more visits, etc. A self-reinforcing effect. Most other Hot Network Questions from Ask Different have a less exciting title; some examples:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/332848Is Mac OS Extended (Journaled) safe to be used as a developer instead of the Case-sensitive type?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/333313Partition Mac hard drive and install two copies of macOS to segregate home and work usage


Due to the https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/141648/295232association bonus, users from all over the network are able to upvote (and not downvote) on Ask Different, even though they have no participation here. That's why voting on questions and answers on the Hot Network Question appears to be skewed.

And yes, sometimes it does feel odd when you get so much upvotes for an answer you wrote in five minutes, while an elaborate answer which took you an hour only gets a handful (or none at all). I usually try to think of that as 'compensation'. In the end, it will all even out.

How do you silence Mojave “Your Disk is almost full” notification? [duplicate]
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/351045/how-do-you-silence-mojave-your-disk-is-almost-full-notificationHow do you silence Mojave "Your Disk is almost full" notification?

The first two answers suggests to use the terminal.  Using the terminal isn't the macOS way.  It's the linux way.  The third suggest it's a bug. 

None of the answers are any good to a novice user.  None of the answers explain the downside of doing what is suggested.  The cited article doesn't explain what the problem is. The best answer is to delete some stuff, which isn't an answer in the cited article. 

Saying the question is a duplicate is bad advice.  This is a novice user, so how are we being nice to the user?

Three things:


Thanks for asking on meta!
Nice is being polite in constructive criticism or pointing out how to reverse any decision that's relating to closing or deleting.
It's super simple to edit the question - anyone can edit it so that it's totally clear how it's not different.


Let's look at option 3. So - if you are trying to make use of the linked article - say that at the start. Explain which specific steps on which specific answer you tried and your results. Once it's clear how you need help understanding or getting past a roadblock, it's no longer a duplicate.

Now - sometimes editing a closed question is hard - there are comments, there are attempts to answer and people are more caught up in what happened to get there and they can't look at the question with new eyes. No problem, just ask a new question - make it well edited - clear and let's see if it's going to avoid closing.

Here is some criticism so you can see why someone would mark it as duplicate:


This question is over 2 years old and doesn't work with the newest version of MacOS (10.14.2).


That statement is literally asking for it to be closed as dupe. Rather than saying "this isn't a dupe" show us in words or pictures how Mojave is different. Show an error message or a screen that changed - show something about the problem you face and don't add "meta" like "this isn't a dupe, please don't close" (You might be surprised how often that happens, and it never makes a question easier to answer and often gets closed as unclear at that point)


This is also not helpful at all.


That's a statement up to interpretation. Help us help you by clearly explaining why you felt it would be helpful and why it wasn't. Document the problem instead of say "there's a problem" and then leaving it up to anyone's guess as to what you see the problem to be.


Why was this marked as a duplicate? The thread linked is over 2 years old and no longer applicable. I already tried everything in that thread.


You fell into the trap to put what should be a comment into the body - just delete that, it can't make anyone want to vote to reopen since now there's that to clean up once it reopens.



Now for constructive praise, you say here that you have a problem with terminal. That would be excellent to put in the question. At least someone could say - without terminal, you can't do what you want. Better, explain why terminal doesn't work. Every single OS that I know of that's commercial has scripting languages. PowerShell, DOS, AppleScript, bash, python, lisp, etc...

It's opinion whether terminal is Mac like or Windows like or just odd. The fact is terminal exists and is powerful and lets you do things you can't with a mouse and keyboard (other than open terminal, of course).

It's OK to say you don't want to use scripting, but this site allows anyone to answer so even if you don't want that option, your question exists more to help everyone than to help you. The whole reason people answer here is to contribute to knowledge. If you're just looking for 1:1 tech support, I can see how you're disappointed, since that's not at all what happens here.

You get 1:1 tech support when you ask a clear, amazing question and that support is a by-product of the actual good being produced. Open source Q&A that are up to specific documented standards. None of this is a reflection on you - it's OK to want help and it's ok to ask for it just as it's OK for people to vote to close when that makes sense given the site norms and rules.

The command symbol (⌘), also known as 'place of interest', has an important place in the history of Apple as being one of its most used modifier keys. In addition, the design won't get Stack Exchange in trouble.

  The "linked questions" in the sidebar is the domain of ...whom?


From the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linked-questions[linked-questions] tag excerpt:


  The "Linked Questions" sidebar is a user-generated list of related questions shown when viewing a question. Its content comes from questions that users have linked in the question, their answers, or in comments, or questions which have been closed as a duplicate of the current question.


So everybody can contribute to that list.



I'm not really sure what you want to achieve with the rest of your post. If you see the umpteenth duplicate question about opening a package, just flag it as a duplicate. If it's not really a duplicate, one of the questions might be able to be turned into a https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/canonical-questionscanonical question.

Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GeoffNixon I don't think it's an _algorithm_, so much as just a convenient accumulation of all the links people have posted in answers, comments, etc. No decision process involved anywhere.


















How do I ask a question so I can increase my "reputation score"?  This seems impossible for a genuine user doing genuine research, so that means anyone with a reputation is more corrupt than a genuine user.  Although the "reputation" system probably has some effect to remove some spam and robotic evil, the corruption the "reputation" system causes is so severe that it most likely creates a snowball effect where it filters out the most genuine people first and goes right on down the line, peeling off all the honest people that would ever use the platform.  Furthermore, the initial corruption of fake systems to create the above non-genuine "reputation" also snowballs, corrupting every result as that corruption branches out into all questions and answers.  The "reputation" system as devised by StackExchange seems sick to its core, and I don't know any way around it.

Is there an honest genuine non-fake method to obtain "reputation" for this stackexchange web site?

TDLR: **answer questions that you have some knowledge of or expertise in.** That's how I did it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would note than in meta downvotes do not mean that it is a bad question just that voters disagree with it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just want to add to what @Mark said - there’s an unintended consequence of downvoting...the question gets pushed “down” when it reaches a threshold.  I’m not a big fan of down voting meta posts because answers that could potentially help the OP end up losing exposure.



















How do I ask a question so I can increase my "reputation score"?

In my opinion, you're going about this the wrong way.  Your goal (with respect to  questions) should be one of two things:

increase your knowledge
share your knowledge (in the form of writing a Q&A)

Points should be a distant third in the order of priority.  Points come from positively contributing because others have found what you asked to be of value.  Speaking from personal experience, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/351856/why-do-my-airpods-show-up-in-dev-156-timesI have up voted questions which I myself never once had nor foresee even having in the future.  Why? Reasons include, but aren't limited to the question being...

an interesting topic
well written
well researched


This seems impossible for a genuine user doing genuine research, so
that means anyone with a reputation is more corrupt than a genuine
user.

Absolutely not on both points.  There are very common questions that have been asked many times so blindly going forward and re-asking the same question without having researched it is a sure way to stop you in your tracks.
Now, making the assertion that people with reputation points is somehow corrupt is quite frankly offensive and insulting.  It's unlikely you'll win any allies or supporters if you approach the community with that temperament.
While no system is ever perfect and like all systems that involve actual people, Ask Different is no different and it too has it's own sociological trends (I call them the "up vote brigade and down vote horde").  Note:  I am not suggesting in any way there is collusion amongst members to target others either positively or negatively - they system actually has algorithms to detect this behavior and mitigate it.  Instead, I am saying that "https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3476/119271lightning does in fact strike."
The last thing I am going to say with respect to your "corruption point" is that unlike anything else in the real world, with knowledge, we all start at zero.  Are there people who game the system?  Of course, they rarely last long on here.  However,  when it comes to actually knowing what you're talking about, a vast majority of the high "scoring" users are some of the most knowledgeable people I have run across on tech forums.
You can't "corrupt" your way to genuine knowledge and skill.  Period.
How to earn points
Ok, you want to earn points.  Who doesn't?  Here's some tips on gaining reputation quickly

Contribute.  Look for questions that don't have answers (and haven't already been asked/answered) and answer them backed with some good research (citations to said research are always a good thing to provide to bolster your credibility).

Ask a genuinely unique question.  Apple releases updates, new products, etc. all the time so the opportunity for a "new" question will always present itself.    Granted this may be more difficult than asking what's on the top of your head at the moment, but some thoughtful questions with some good research goes along way.  There may even be no answer to the question, but you put it out there.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/298853/119271Ask and answer your own question.  You may have a unique question that nobody's asked and obviously nobody has answered.  Doing your own research can and will lead you to the answer.  Go ahead and write a Q&A - it's an opportunity to "double dip" in the points bin on a single question!


Most importantly, stay positive and keep working with the goal to increase your knowledge.  The reputation points will follow.

I rarely down vote but when I do, I have explained why either in comments or chat.  But the flip side of that coin is unresearched, poorly written questions get immediate up votes


















I haven't seen the Most Active Contributors monthly report since https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3185/most-active-contributors-monthly-report-december-2017Dec 2018.  I find the info very interesting and informative (h/t @Monomeeth).

Quoted from Ask Different chat:


  Apologies for the delay, had some major real-life distractions for the past couple of weeks. All the data is ready, but I've actually been working on the first annual edition (taking more time since it's the first one, so no existing templates, images, etc). I guess I could publish the January monthly report first if people were keen. Regardless, will be back to the usual schedule by the time the February report needs to go out.

I've also been working on the first annual edition (taking a while since it's the first one), so keep an eye out for that - I think people will like it! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How *DARE* you let life get in the way.. ;-P Thanx again for the great work, and I finally made the list... cool!


















Writing good questions is hard, probably even harder than writing good answers. So thanks for bringing this up on Meta. 

For me a „wall of text“ question is a post which requires me to read a lot text without me knowing why I‘m reading it and how it relates to the question. Typically such questions miss a clear problem statement, provide a lot of potentially irrelevant detail, and come to the point/the question only at the end. This means that one has to read the text at least twice (once to see what the question is, the second time to look for the relevant facts among all the details). 

Specifically I assume you talk about https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/352662/is-anysearch-browser-extension-from-apples-extension-gallery-malwareIs AnySearch browser extension from Apple's Extension Gallery malware?. Have you compared your initial version with my (rather big) edit? Is there anything missing in the edited version which you consider essential for answering the question? Or is this an edit which helps to show the difference between a wall-of-text and a focused question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That Q's the inspiration, and since this meta has no guidance for "wall-of-text"… I specifically wonder why people don't read the title and skim over the quotes, that are only there in case of link-rot, and also per recommendation of various [help] texts. The edit mainly cuts out the quotes, requiring readers to click the links, for as long as those are still up, at that location. (& "similar-named" is almost proleptic answering; they look identical) Sure, trimming some fat is often possible somehow. But here I find WoT a dishonest assessment, and frankly don't believe it to be true.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for this sentence alone:  *Is there anything missing in the edited version which you think essential for answering the question?*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@langlangc Allan has a good point in his answer: one gets lost after reading a few lines, attention wanders off and one  ignores the question, downvotes, and/or votes to close. It‘s up to the question writer to write a question in a fashion which keeps readers involved. I don‘t want to argue about what your intention was, all I can tell you is how I think your question could be improved.


















The Wall of Text
The (official?) definition of a Wall of Text as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wall_of_textWikipedia is as follows:

A wall of text is an excessively long post to a noticeboard or talk
page discussion, which can often be so long that some don't read it.

However, I tend to prefer this https://www.definitions.net/definition/Wall%20of%20Textdefinition as it incorporates "paragraph breaks" as, I believe this is key over the actual length of the post.

A large and intimidating piece of writing, particularly one with few
or no paragraph breaks.

For example, using your question as an example:

do not require any scrolling to read to completion one gets accused of
"wall of text"? So how much text, context and detail is too much
before the attention deficit usually kicks in here?

Could be considered a wall of text due to the no paragraph breaks.  A single carriage return drastically increases the readability:

....do not require any scrolling to read to completion one gets accused of "wall of text"?
So how much text, context and detail is too much before the attention deficit usually kicks in here?

Questions with relevant context
Speaking only for myself, one of the things that makes questions difficult to answer is the long and drawn out narrative before getting to the problem:
So, one sunny day, I bought a MacBook Pro that I use for surfing the web and responding to online trolls, my co-worker who only uses Windows but has shown some interest in my iPhone decides to borrow my Mac to check my email.  All of a sudden my battery won't hold a charge.  I plug in my charger and I get a green light, then an amber light, and then it never goes green.  But if I unplug it, it's green again.  What could he have possibly done and is there a command that I can issue that can restore the battery capacity.
Yeah.  I probably lost your attention there.  Questions like this, I lose focus about 2 lines in.
So, how much is "too much?"  When you're outside of describing:

the problem (battery won't hold a charge)
what you tried (plugging in charger)
what solution you're looking for.

The important takeaway from this should be:  Be succinct.  Focus on the problem and provide some context.  What you did is more important than why you did it.  And if we need clarification, we will always ask via comments.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This Q was formatted deliberately to be as short as possible. With my screen setting I arrive at 4 lines in one paragraph. This is neither 'a lot' nor a wall in my eyes. Adding paragrphs would indeed increase readilbility and I would have done so, if it weren't for the accusation I faced. That's also why I left out the mainQ that prompted this (cf nohillside's answer and the previous edits on main: adding those would have elongated the above as well again…)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*With my screen setting...*  That's the problem.  Most likely very few people have *your* screen settings.  I read these Q/As on many devices from iPhones, iPads to 13" laptops and 27" screens; it looks different on all.  Without proper formatting, attention deficit kicks in rather quickly especially on smaller devices. *In your eyes,* it may not be a WoT, but you're not writing a Q or A for *your eyes.*  You're writing it for others to read, and hopefully provide you an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's still just four lines and a single paragraph, less than 400 characters total. How can that be excessively long, or intimidating? The built in hard-limit on SE is 30000? Most comments are longer. Yours is 342 for content. And virtually all top-voted questions across the network I see are longer as well. Take it as given that I know and usually add more reader-friendly para-breaks. That's not the issue. Writing better Qs that are as short as meaningfully poossible but do not require too much clarification comments is. [Help] says add context. Users here say "too long, my eyes"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok...to make it short and succinct with respect to the linked question:  You could have said, *I installed [AnySearch via the Safari Gallery](https://apple.co/2vcCAPs) but Malware Bytes says it's the [Anysearch Virus](https://bit.ly/2BS0HVZ).  Is Malware Bytes mistakenly identifying this as a threat or is this valid?*  None of the extraneous "I found it handy," or "this is from Apple" narrative would have been necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@langlangc One of the problems with your original question is that it doesn‘t ask what you wanted to know. It reads like comparing two extensions with the same name, with a lot of detailed information, and then asking whether they are the same or not. All this information is fairly irrelevant for your actual question (is this extension from the gallery malware?). So one had to read a lot of stuff which didn’t help in understanding the real question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your ultrashort version can only be read as valid after knowing the answer, as it is devoid of context, doesn't document what I tried to solve this etc. Specifically it leaves out that googling this, one is also led to believe it's malicious by skimming the top hits there. Are you sure *you* wouldn't have asked for clarification? Short: from all I read on meta so far, and [help] in particular I concluded to write the Q to the best of my knowledge. Your suggestion would contradict that IMO. Would that have been still WoT if no-quotes at all?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@langlangc The quotes added nothing to the question of whether the extension you‘ve downloaded from the gallery is malware, they rather distracted from the key message.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok.  You could have added *Doing a [Google search](https://bit.ly/2Xsfj7y) brings up a number of links that indicate it's a virus.* and still gotten your point across.  I get the feeling you want to make the argument that your extensive research and writing should be validate because you deem it critical or necessary;  what's critical and necessary is communicating to your *audience*.  What I think you're forgetting is that we're not reviewing academic papers here, we're attempting to solve problems.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also...I didn't know the answer going in.  I initially (before the major edit) read your question, asked "huh?", read it again, gave up and moved on.  I still have no idea what the "answer" is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not me alone, also the texts I quoted say 'give context'. Without the quotes it's a bare link and readers *will* have no clue what's this about without evaluating two links (or read two short quotes in place). If someone sees a WoT, he may move on. But here the downvoters are still not content with the lack of content. This meta is not even about that specific Q, that never had "a sunny day" (in it) and wasn't 'excessive? The DVs now say "still a WoT". The argument: a better guideline (What is WoT, how much is necessary content, in general, is needed. Contradictions: this Q 2short?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oy vey. I literally answered all of that in my answer to this Q.   People vote for whatever reason including if a Q is unclear.  Me?  I vote to close if I can't edit it.  I can't and won't argue the point on what is "enough" as it's not an objective measurement.  You need to apply your own judgement and determine if *others* will be able to read and understand your Q.  You seem to have a very negative reaction when people give you feedback that your Q is not what you think it is. Don't.  Just go with it and *give the people what they say works for them.*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC personally, I don't think your latest revision was a "wall of text", but I agree that the quote regarding the official extension is not too relevant because I don't find any useful information to answer the question (you could just put a link to the extension and mention the author to show which extension you're talking about). The second quotation was useful enough to make the question standalone. As for the opening paragraph "context", the only useful info is that "this is an old extension", which mean it's not updated anymore but detected (false-positively) by MalwareBytes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC Most downvoters usually don't come back to change their votes even after a post has been edited. And as usual: nobody knows for sure *why* you got downvotes (I had a suspicion and acted on it, but one or the other of the downvoters may just have had a bad day).


















I subscribe to several SE sites. I've noticed that the question links on the Questions page are rendered differently on the AskDifferent site than they are on the other sites I visit: After clicking the link to a question, and returning to the Questions page, the question(s) I've read are not rendered in a different color; i.e. visited links are indistinguishable from those that have not been visited. This seems to be true only on the AskDifferent site. 

Is this "by design"??
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are visited links not rendered differently from non-visited links in AskDifferent?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retagging this as [bug], since that will draw the attention of Stack Exchange developers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Glorfindel: That's cool... I would've done so, but wasn't certain it was a bug.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A few sites have visited colors that I find hard to spot, I ended up adding `GM_addStyle (".question-hyperlink:visited { color: green; }");` to a user-script because green seems to be pretty clear on all sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi, I was about to post this exactly question, Check this other Stack Exchange site, click on any messages, go back. It is VERY easier to navigate than our AskDifferent. https://gaming.stackexchange.com  Any news about this topic?? Can I put a bounty on this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Prado: Re bounty: I'd save my points... this doesn't seem to be a concern to anyone.


















Today a new update was made to Hot Network Questions, it included giving moderators the ability to remove a question from HNQ.


  There are times when the hotness formula selects a question that a site would rather not have featured. Up until now, the only recourse that was available was to close the question (which may be appropriate anyway but isn't ideal when done purely to manage traffic), or to do nothing. We're putting the power in the hands of our moderators to remove questions that don't set a good example for their sites. I recommend each site have a meta discussion with guidance for moderators about when - if ever - a question should be removed.



https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/325060/updating-the-hot-network-questions-list-now-with-a-bit-more-network-and-a-littUpdating the Hot Network Questions List - now with a bit more network and a little less "hotness"!


So, when should a question be removed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should a Question Ever be Removed from Hot Network Questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for asking this on meta. It's certainly something that will have to be *settled* over time. As @nohillside says in his answer, any policy re this sort of *power* needs to be based on experience. This site has a good mix of mods and I'm certainly comfortable none of us would use this option arbitrarily.


















I hold the strong opinion that policy should be defined based on experience. And as we don‘t have any experience with that new functionality yet it‘s too early to define a policy. 

I probably would consider to remove a question from the list if a lot of mod actions are required by either the question, the answers and/or the comments, and/or a question would attract a lot of off-topic answers from users new to AD. But even for that we have other ways we can deal with such things, so for the moment it‘s just important to know that we have this new option. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. Any new policy, especially one granting *power* (or a new responsibility), should definitely be based on experience.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some HNQs are just terrible, some really deserve a spotlight. "even for that we have other ways": to inform a policy and discuss it, these 'ways' should be known to the public. It might help to list those here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes - we would absolutely want to remove a question if it's causing a distortion - so please flag us if you see things like way too much reputation being granted so we can make that post wiki or an answer wiki to handle that over accumulation of reputation. We haven't needed to do that often, but a couple of times we missed the chance to help the site out by capping rep on certain posts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC the other ways are the usual mod tools, most of them accessible to high rep users as well: vote to close, up/downvote, move comments to chat, remove answers which are rants or don‘t drive the topic forwards etc


















How can I thank a user in the Ask Different community for providing an https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/295805/121968answer so exceptionally good that it saved my MacBook Pro from getting trashed?

Now, seriously, this site is great, but as much as I try to get in contact or thank the https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/251859/langlangc@LangLangC user for his exceptional answer to my problem, I simply seem not to get anywhere because I'm too new to the site, to green to matter or too short to be taken into account, dunno which. I can't even post a darn comment on the reply to thank him/her.

The MacBook Pro GPU overheat problem was a nightmare, it prevented me from using my computer and am sure hundreds or thousands of other users too, many of which probably were not lucky enough to find https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/251859/langlangc@LangLangC's response to the issue and possibly ended up discarding, selling or shelling their MBs.

This is probably going to be discarded too, but if anyone reads this and knows/can contact @LangLangC, please do tell that we ignored people are actually thankful for his response.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to thank an Ask Different user that saved my MacBook Pro, as well as my personal finances from destruction?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder if mods could go in and mark that as the accepted answer since it doesn't look like the asker is coming back...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Somehow I wish that would be possible too, but it's not. (And it's really more honest this way: OP just didn't accept it, probably never saw it) Then the tick is not that important anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5More useful would be some kind of curated, accumulating 'metaQ' on main; a merger? My answer *isn't* the only one for the problem. There are other ways (discarding all kexts [like OP did], using linux for variable setting [most often seen], a boot loader.)  My answer is already excessively long and it might be unwise to include the other 2 good options as well. I cross-linked below the other options in comments in most posts touching the problem, but find that not very effective.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Moderators don't have the power of marking an answer as accepted, but a score of 58 tells much more than a single checkmark.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5please do accept my apologies, I certainly did not intend to leave the answers unaccepted for so long, but being new to the platform and trying to do this from a cellphone were certainly delaying and frustrating. I'll mark the answer of my choice as accepted but wanted to also point out that it didn't let me do it from the cellphone, just as it wouldn't let me add comments, participate on chats, etc. in all cases it would pop up a message indicating I didn't have the points needed to do it, which it doesn't now that I'm trying from the restored MB... anyhow, thanks and sorry for the delay!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you were somehow not logged in on your phone. And there's no need to apologize, this is a Q&A site and not a chat were people expect real-time responses ...


















I've https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/49432510pinged the user in chat, so chances are they will now read your message.
For the general case, I'll reiterate the https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/17886/295232advice by one of Stack Exchange's founders:

If you really want to thank someone for a good answer, then you'll perhaps take the time to go through one of their questions and provide a good answer for some question they have.
Alternately, just "pay it forward" and answer another user's question. That's really what it's all about.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, I have come to understand and admire the collaborative spirit of all the exceptional people that took the time to read, react and help me convey my gratitude to @LangLangC; your's specially Glorfindel as I had already tried all the options visible to me at the time and had been unsuccessful in getting them through to LangLangC.  I'll definitively try to "pay it forward" and attempt to provide useful answers/information whenever I can on this great platform. Meanwhile, thank you again for your time and kindness.


















John Gruber of Daring Fireball refers to https://daringfireball.net/2014/09/the_iphones_6the iPhones 6, https://daringfireball.net/2016/09/the_iphones_7the iPhones 7, https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/the_iphones_xsthe iPhones XS and so on, as a more elegant form of words than "the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus" or "the iPhone XS and XS Max": 


  The last four years, I’ve coyly titled my iPhone reviews “The iPhones
  6”, “The iPhones 6S”, “The iPhones 7”, and “The iPhones 8”. That’s not
  how most people would pluralize these iPhone pairs (but some would —
  there’s some legitimate precedent with pluralizations like
  “mothers-in-law” and “attorneys general” where the adjective comes
  after the noun).


So I would expect most people to say MacBook Pros, but feel free to call them MacBooks Pro if you and your audience find it amusing.

Flattered as I am now, it is also very satisfying to read that another usable laptop was saved from its premature fate in the dumpster.

2- the fact that you devoted all that time, effort and knowledge to help others just for the sake of sharing, kinda helps us desperate fellas restore a bit of faith in humanity
3- hopefully, you'll never be in a position where a MB is financially unaffordable, but trust me, that is probably the case for many people you have helped out with that guide, in my case it was basically the difference between having a PC or not outside of work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Much more can be added for which I and I’m sure many people around the world are thankful to you, but since you’re probably bored already, let me just say that I’ll do my best to follow your example and as others have suggested, “pay it forward” trying to help others on this community whenever possible.  Thank you again and if I ever get the “points” necessary to actually use the chat tool on this thing, I’ll try to reach out to you again and gladly buy you a beer/coffee/chocolate/whatever-you-prefer through Patreon, PayPal or whatever is allowed...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well said, far better than recycling is reuse. A+ all around and heart warming community building.



















  With the introduction of dark mode in macOS, Safari Technology Preview 68 has released a new feature called prefers-color-scheme which lets us detect whether the user has dark mode enabled with a media query. 



https://css-tricks.com/dark-modes-with-css/https://css-tricks.com/dark-modes-with-css/


As a site based around Apple products, I think it would be pretty cool to support dark mode CSS media queries.  Safari is the first major browser to support this and I think other browsers are likely to follow.  

I would also suggest adding a toggle in Settings as many people use Chrome who https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-schemedoesn't currently support this.

Below is the media query:

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {

}

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's support Dark Mode!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "dark theme" in general has been suggested [since 2011](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/111399/241919) though...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Oh...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds like it’s about time!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I’m reading the site on my iPad in a darkened room and it’s blinding. Yes, please, Dark Mode!

What's this theme on Ask Different? What's the reason behind enabling it?

It’s a party!

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/326036/announcing-the-stack-exchange-time-machineAnnouncing the Stack Exchange Time Machine

(And kind of an education.) There are actually elements of this design that are useful / helpful which is why they were chosen back in the 90’s when everyone was experimenting about how to show the structure that the code uses for html.

But mostly a party and a reminder that shared experiences will make an annoyance to most be a reminiscence to others. Also, it’s a reminder that things change.

I’m totally planning to leave it enabled for as long as the hilarity lasts. Especially the guest book where everyone’s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-egoid (or in the original das Es) is running amok on the sugar high.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So far, I’m having more fun the longer I leave it enabled.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5as far as I can tell the guestbook isn't real... unless there are like 4 or 5 people posting the same 4 or 5 posts over and over. My post showed up and scrolled away and never bounced back into the rotation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That’s what makes it so fun. FFFFIIIIRRRSSSTTT! And such hilarity - a hell banned echo chamber was actually implemented and people are poking at it (me included). We love to explore and shiny things apparently.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe it's the [Buzz Killington](https://familyguy.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Killington) in me but this feels like everything I disliked about the 90s Internet and the 90s in general.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan I didn't realize there were unicorn farts from the cursor until just now. The iOS experience wasn't as full on the nose as what anyone with a mouse pointer was experiencing. Wow!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The unicorn farts were a close 2nd to this [abhorrent thing](https://www.picgifs.com/graphics/u/under-construction/graphics-under-construction-205618.gif) from back then.


















We got hit by a massive flood of spam posts. The automated spam detector and the moderators are working on removing them, but they still bump up every question to the front page. To see new questions only, use the https://apple.stackexchange.com/?tab=week"week" view.

Also, if you still see answers looking like


  my name is NAME My private video, see URL


please flag them as spam so we can remove them.

Generally speaking comments which adhere to the principles described in the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commentFAQ are always welcome. They can help in clarifying both questions and answers, and/or provide feedback to the author. But please keep in mind that there is no obligation on the side of the original author of a post to react on the feedback received through comments, neither is there a guarantee that any answer on AD (or any StackExchange site) is correct. Voting can be used for answers which you consider not to be correct.

Also, we tend to delete comments (or move them into a chat room) if they divert from the guidelines, lead to controversial discussions, are not related to the topic of the question etc. Especially extended discussions in general should be help in chat.

Specifically to the question you've linked to we found comments which should have been answers, comments in which people where told they were wrong, also some had other issues not related to the related post. To keep quality up, and avoid bad emotions on any side, we choose to delete all comments. Further discussions can be done in the corresponding https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/92013/discussion-on-question-by-sara-pruneddu-is-it-possible-to-download-internet-explchat room if necessary.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wasn't referring to the comments in the question (which hasn't been deleting but moved to chat, which is less of an issue) but comments in the answers which provided useful information. In this case, would it be better to rewrite the same comment or just downvote the answer? Even if it doesn't necessarily deserve one (needing more information doesn't mean entirely wrong)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zakinster The alternative to purging the comments would be locking the posts to unravel what's going on. I chose to not lock since I was hopeful that edits could get answers in to the answers and that process can happen right away. Please feel free to make edits to any answers that are not complete in the linked post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zakinster If posts can be improved while keeping the intention of the author in place, an edit *might* be an option. Emphasis intended :-) as I do not fully agree with your assessment of the comments you laid out in your question. You pointed out issues with the answer, the OP explained why they have a different point of view, so an edit probably doesn't really improve anything.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zakinster Having said that: If you need the comments beneath your own answer back so you can incorporate them into your answer, I can easily undelete them for a while.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside for the assessment, I did it by memory of things I didn't wrote myself so it's a mix of what I remember and what I think is currently missing in the answers. And indeed if "relevant minor information" comment can be incorporated in an answer with an edit while keeping the original intention in place (even if I prefer to leave that to the original author), "constructive criticism" comments can not unless taken into account by the original author himself. If not taken into account, should they be deleted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zakinster Deleting comments is always an option of course.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Ok so since constructive criticism doesn't fit as an edit and since the points I refer to in my question still stands. Should they be written as comments or constitutes (potentially unfair) downvotes without comments?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zakinster I'm not sure I understand you correctly on this. Comments are not here for eternity, the poster has acknowledged your comment the first time you posted it, so what do you expect to happen if you post it again?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside (Please note that they are not *my* comments) Yes comments are not **meant** to last for eternity, they are meant to last for as long as they are relevant. If the answer is not updated, downvoted to the ground or deleted, the comment should last as long as they have some pertinence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zakinster I understand your position, it‘s not the general policy though. Answers are as they are, comments can be deleted anytime. If you want to propose a different comment policy please raise the point on meta.stackexchange.com.


















Zakinster - first off - thank you so much for coming to the site to help answer that question. Secondly, thank you for asking here.

I'd like to flip your question back and ask - "what is your understanding on why you would comment on an answer?"

If you're not sure of commenting - here are some guidelines I like to refer to when I get flags on comments or see someone deleting a post with +15 upvotes when the comments are really not serving an appropriate function.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commenthttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment


So to summarize, comments are not made to be addressed. They are temporary pings to the poster and they get deleted and don’t come back when they are deleted. Don’t put anything in a comment that you’re not prepared to lose when comments are deleted. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The four comments I refer to in my question were either written (by me or others) to "Leave constructive criticism" or "Add relevant but minor information" so they seem to fit in the guidelines.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zakinster sounds good. Feel free to post further comments if they are appropriateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did lock one post. It had some not nice comments and I don’t want that user to get pinged for 24 hours. No worries here - this is a great place to comment and figure out things. Just try not to worry too much about one specific post. After you’ve been here for a month, you’ll have a much better feeling for how the flow of this site goes. That one question got a ridiculous amount of attention and needs to cool off - don’t try to form general rules from an exception would be my advice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See above @zakinster - it’s not you, it’s the situation. It needs to cool off a bit.


















The short answer is probably no, as a moderator here, we cannot migrate a question that has aged past 60 days. Also, we can’t pull questions, so they (SO Moderators and users) would have to send it over, assuming they both can and wish to. 


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-workWhat is migration and how does it work?


The exception for employees migrating seems to be not something they entertain requests and only do it in extenuating circumstances when they need to move something as opposed when we want to see it moved.

What we can do is be sure that (if needed, a new question gets asked here and) the contents of that other answer get replicated here (giving credit / attribution of course) so that no matter what happens in terms of deletion and closure on the other site, we have an on topic question with a correct answer. 

You are correct in the general case, we would prefer to migrate if we could, but I believe we cannot accomplish that even if we wanted to in this specific case.

But note the linked question does not deal really with the case where the original is closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mark Then we'll need to just craft the correct answer for the question asked or ask the question that gets the answer provided. Actually both is just fine. Even if we have 5 to 10 versions of the same question - we can always link them later with closes so that all the searching of different phrasing gets to the same good answer.


















I flagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/353484/150839this particular answer as "not an answer". For reference, the question was:


  How to block bluetooth device that spams me with pairing requests?


and the answer I flagged was:


  Doesn’t seems to work blocking a Samsung Android 900v The Samsung has an unbelivable signal strength for one I would expect for Bluetooth.


To me, this is very much not an answer—it isn't even attempting to answer the question.

In the grand scheme of things, this is super small potatoes, but I'd like to understand for future reference: why was the flag declined? Should I have used a different flag?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was this particular "not an answer" flag declined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you to whoever migrated this, I'd meant to post it here!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for asking. Glad it made it here so our moderators could see it.


















After the votes, the comment asking for clarification and several down votes, it’s clear that answer isn’t going to reach to the community standards and has been deleted.

Thanks for allowing the moderation process to be “moderate” and not “one strike and you’re gone” quick. The rest of the reasoning / policy remains here so people know why it was voted or what potential reasons for declining a flag when an answer has no down votes happens in the future.



The normal escalation path is to use voting and comments to indicate a poor quality answer is there. 

There’s no need for moderators to handle all the steps and typically I prefer not to delete  an attempt to answer unless there are several down votes or a post notice or comment wouldn’t be suitable address a poor quality answer. 

In this case both a comment and post notice were chosen to get the answer edited or attract down votes as needed. 

Flag things that are actively harmful or require intervention when normal moderation tools cannot remedy a bad post. Even wrong answers shouldn’t typically be flagged. I’m not seeing any harm in leaving it up with the post notice to explain how this answer could be improved or at least judged by voting. 

At this point, no one has cared enough to even down vote it. Now it does have some down votes, showing that the community can color that answer as not useful.

The post in question wasn't wrong, it basically said "I have this problem too."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wowfunhappy Here’s the FAQ on declined flags. Let me edit that in above, too. https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/declined-flags Main thing is does it _need_ a moderator to unilaterally handle? There are thousands of non/bad answers and unless they are getting tons of upvotes, they tend to self delete or just warn others they aren’t the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wowfunhappy The key message here is rather "Don't flag if you can act as a moderator yourself", be it by commenting, be it by downvoting, be it by editing. I agree that the post you've flagged is borderline bad and may have been better posted as a comment, but a downvote would have brought that point across even better than a flag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks to @Wowfunhappy again for brining this up - we did have some discussions on how / when to give an answer a choice - I don’t think anyone thought it was a good answer and now the votes down on the main page have had the intended effect to refund all reputation to voters as well as delete the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Down-voters are penalised! It seems a simple decision if an "Answer" does not answer the question asked (many seem to answer something else) - why penalise someone for flagging it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Down-voters are penalised by a single point, & that is refunded if the answer does eventually get deleted. It's just enough to make you careful over what you down-vote, but not enough to stop you if you feel it really deserves it.


















The general rule about putting on hold as duplicates is that we assume a question to be a duplicate if it asks basically the same question and the OP doesn’t explain how the answers to the original question miss to solve the problem. Without additional information this is also valid if the original question is related to a significantly older version of macOS or iOS.  

I agree that there are valid reasons to give a specific topic a new chance by asking it within the context of a new OS version (as also discussed in https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3120/how-should-we-manage-questions-that-have-very-different-answers-per-version-of-mHow should we manage questions that have very different answers per version of macOS?). In such cases this can be easily accomplished by rewording the question accordingly. Even then it should be explained in the question whether the old methods have been tried and what the result was. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These words are wise. Unless the duplicate question is edited to be very clear why the situation is fundamentally different, we should keep questions pointing to the canonical / main place to find answers relating to the main problem. Just saying “this isn’t a duplicate” isn’t enough - it generally shows clearly that a more fundamental edit is still needed.


















I disagree that images should be centred by adding blank space to the image. Since the mobile site centres images automatically, adding this transparent space just reduces the size of the image, making it even harder to read on a mobile device. Unlike many other communities, Ask Different is heavily used on mobile devices with its focus on iOS questions and answers.

                                        

However, that doesn't mean images can't be centred. Something I occasionally use where centring an image makes sense is non-breaking spaces, either literally entered into the text (with a replacement or macro) or with the HTML encoding &nbsp;. Inserting these spaces before the image moves the image along to the right, so a different number of spaces is needed depending on the size of the image.

However the benefit of this is that this does not reduce the size of the image on mobile — it is still displayed in its natural size horizontally centred using the automatic CSS centring provided on the mobile site without any reduction of size.

I used this latter technique to centre the screenshot in this post; open this on your phone to see the image still centred but shown full size, unlike the image in the content of the screenshot.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's the method I was using but got it edited out of my post twice 8-).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@slm Ah I was wondering what prompted this Q&A and I think I just [found it](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/357416/revisions). I'm interested what the reasoning behind those edits were, I'll ping them in chat and point them to this Q&A.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems to me that nearly all SE sites are primarily read on phones or watches. // Images are often too big (load time etc), merely ornamental… in short: images should *not be centered at all*. My +1 one is for the very first sentence of this A.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC - do you disagree w/ centering for browser consumption, I never use the mobile app to consume SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@slm I'd say that an option that enables such a rendering might be aesthetically pleasing, semantically helpful. If there is no way to instruct SE rendering to do that, I only know detrimental options to enforce that (adding hard white space border would be terrible, adding too much formatting by hand-code as well). Perhaps I do not know enough about this, but rendering quirks and defects of SE should be left standing, not in the least to make them engage in fixing them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grg the SE app on Android does not auto center either.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The theme used when visiting SE from Mobile Safari Centers automatically. Posts with manual centering look rather strange then.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, even if the consensus should be that centering is ok, please don‘t edit answers just to center an image!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC I really doubt that. I almost never use my phone for SE, for example. I'm sure many people do, but I really don't think you can generalize to " nearly all SE sites are primarily read on phones", let alone watches! Very few people have smart watches, after all. I expect _this_ site will indeed often be read on mobile, but I doubt that most visitors to SO are on mobile, for example. Far more likely that they're on their computer at work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@terdon Without hard data on this I only ever see complaints from "mobile" users, links to mobile versions of sites, etc… The point here is that the backend *has to* take care of the different actual renderings, for mobile or 'real device' (layout, perhaps with selectable options), the authors do the content (incl structure, but *not* micro-layout; just like good LaTeX, only without orienting layouts to paper/PDF, but screens of varying sizes).


















As far as I understand this issue as presented, we should not even offer any style guide in that particular direction (others: maybe).

But the core problem is already exemplified within the question:


  StackExchange provides no assistance in this department by continuing to ignore this issue across all SE properties,…


Posts on this site and others across SE have numerous problems regarding good layout that may be overcome by going to lengths by authors. 

I tried that in a few, and it's mainly backbiting experience, waste of time and more importantly: if it's going to be fixed at the root, it was all for nothing, actually detrimental.

One example https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/261258/incorrect-spacing-around-headersIncorrect spacing around headers almost 4 years in the inbox, not fixed. If we start to workaround this now, with formatting tricks, we counter the intuitiveness of mark down by making it more complicated and if the feature request is granted, then all posts looking 'better' now will look not nice.

The place to request such options is https://meta.stackexchange.com/https://meta.stackexchange.com/

I've been making a concerted effort to contribute here, but see a lot of the same "in-crowd" politics as on other forums, particularly the open source ones.

I don't understand why there's a desire (much less a need) to be so brutal to newcomers and newbies. 

As long as it's not a case of trolling, shouldn't everyone be civil? Most people aren't malicious. What's that line? Never mistake for ill intent what can be easily explained by stupidity. Learn to give people the benefit of the doubt.

None of us are perfect. It's not okay to bite someone's head off for failing to be the perfect question poster. Manners and decorum are not optional just because you were poorly raised.

Is the goal to replicate Lord of the Flies or to build a community where humans help each other get stuff done?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is StackExchange supposed to be so hostile?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have any examples you can point to?  I looked at your profile and don't see any hostile or uncivil activity on any of your questions or answers.  It's difficult ot address your concerns if they're generic like this.  For example, I'm not seeing the 'hostility to newcomers' that you call out so please help us understand the context of your question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another unfortunate thing is that such evidence rapidly disappears...as in literally the comments, sometimes entire conversations just get deleted. I suppose I should begin taking screen shots. *sigh*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Here's one example: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/358640/can-i-upload-unlimited-data-to-archive-org/358643#358643 - unfortunately, the offending conversation has been deleted already...maybe you have the ability to see it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Bingo if comments are the problem - we are and should be intentionally more quick to delete comments that are not super clear about making the post clearer. Want to raise comments as a new question here? My answer is vague since your main post didn’t have specificsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: "*to build a community where humans help each other get stuff done?*" Sorry, but the goal of Stack Exchange is *not* to answer everyone's question (this site is not really a personal help support) but to build a library of high-quality Q&A. The fact that the asker gets helped is just the side-effect of achieving the main goal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Bill - the first version of this question - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/358640/can-i-upload-unlimited-data-to-archive-org - was objectively very bad and should probably be deleted if it doesn't get a substantial edit even past the edit I have made. I wouldn't worry you got down votes trying to help save a bad situation. The [help] covers what not to ask and [ask]. I would have down voted it if there weren't 5 others that already did their duty to indicate quality issues. Worse, it's still off topic even if a great edit fixes the quality issues with the post.


















I would say, yes - if hostile means that soft or vague or undocumented posts are challenged politely and constructively. If posts are edited or closed or voted down, also then yes. This is such a place where polite disagreement and high level discussion is to be had in an adult manner. Your question here is a perfect example of that - questioning our entire motivation, philosophy, and culture.
It might get up votes and it might get down votes, but the discussion should be encouraged, welcomed and dignified. Disagreement is not hostility, so I hope you aren’t referring to that above, though, in your definition of hostile. (And I don’t think you are asking that, but you didn’t put in words or examples so I had to start somewhere.)
I would say no, we never should allow bullying or mean or personal challenges to remain. They will happen, but they should be aired, discussed and ultimately changed by the moderation tools. Moderation is comments, votes, edits and flags by everyone who has the reputation to moderate. It’s also flags and actions by those of us that are elected moderators and people who post on meta.
I also respect your making this vague and not posting specific examples of this behavior so we all can agree on the ideals and goals.
There should be a bright dividing line between something being critical and ok versus something being hostile and not ok. That line is our code of conduct.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/conducthttps://apple.stackexchange.com/conduct

Now, the world is full of grey and language and norms make one thing appear less like hostility to some, so we do all need to be open to someone mis-typing and not meaning harm on occasion. But if that happens after flags and after clarification - patterns of clear intent are no excuse to not engage to remove or correct clear violations of the code.
Please flag potential code violations each time you see them and unless we are declining your flags, keep on us. Now we don’t need 10 flags at once if one will do, but over time careful flagging is the best defense against hostility.
If you want to flag as other any cases of unkindness, hostility or just uncertainty  - I am sure the mod team will reach out privately or publicly to ensure we address anything you see. A follow on question here on meta might be good as well if you want to ask how or why a certain post ended up where it is today.
I wouldn’t recommend flagging a post with less than 5 net down votes or flagging any one instance where comments are cleaned up or a post couldn’t be saved by an edit.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My problem is that it's often NOT politely and constructively. Several times I've seen responses that would have led to a fist fight if it were said in person. To my chagrin, such instances often result in deleted comments, answers and even questions such that no corrective measures can be taken. Worse, if you point out that something seems crass, expect a few downvotes as your reward. The goal should be to guide others in the right direction, not to be a brick wall that punishes the slightest infraction. Admin != GODb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes bill. It’s hard if you expect every comment to be clear or useful, let alone all kind. **flag as other** is the best way to correct that issue. If you see a pattern of rudeness from one account, please flag as other and explain the pattern. We can see deleted posts and will address privately with the party any patterns. Down voting is not hostile, so I see that a lot when people feel a down vote is bad. It’s just one person casting one vote. Over time, the cream always seems to rise to the top and some unpopular answers are still valuable and useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I’ve occasionally read some replies as hostile but after consideration realized they were probably better categorized as brusque. Like I personally try to answer a with a little less edge, but it doesn’t cross any lines.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't mistake terse for hostile. Especially in written form, it's easy to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some of the boilerplate posts (Off topic, moved to X; Duplicate of Y; etc) could be rewritten in a kinder way. I'd be pretty wary of using the site again if my first post was rubber-stamped in that way. Also, I think some of the "editorial rewrites" border onto style choices rather than technical clarifications.


















Quite a number of questions posted require debugging of an individual situation. I don't think any of us volunteers are longing to be unpaid technical support, especially without the tools required to gather the appropriate background information. 

Example: User can't delete a file, presumably because of a rights issue. This is a situation akin to diagnosing your neighbor's/grandmother's midnight computer problem by phone. If you were there, you could spot the problem in a few minutes, but because you must presume their ignorance and you don't have VNC/RDP/SSH/SCP access, it becomes a painful, time-consuming interchange.

Is there an official SE procedure for responding to questions that are going to require diagnosis? Are there tools available that I may not be aware of? Newbies don't have access to chat. 

I almost wish there were a flow chart for qualifying how to handle a question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Many supposed questions are actually requests for debuggingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In addition to what bmike explained below: it helps to keep in mind that nobody has any obligation to answer any question at all. So if you don‘t know the answer or consider it too mach a back and forth to identify the cause of a problem, just move on ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike &nohillside Thanks for the wisdom...very relevant to my experiences here so far. I loved the reference to "Family Tech Support, Web 2.0 version" Nothing is as frustrating as remote debugging with a clueless person by phone or text. In the future, I will consider whether I'm encouraging the question poster to do their own homework first or more vampire-like behavior.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You‘re welcome. Sometimes the challenge is to figure out whether somebody is skilled enough to do their homework first (but just didn’t do it yet) or whether they are far out of their comfort zone and need detailed handholding ;-)


















This is a hard problem and I’m glad you are approaching it from the viewpoint of how to be helpful of people asking for help and respectful of the time and effort to properly answer a question.

It’s trivially easy to write “I am stuck doing X - HELP!” and it’s hard to look the other way when you know some version of 20 questions or basic troubleshooting might get to a question that can be answered, but that this situation is almost certainly not refined enough for someone to answer directly.

In the past, people felt they needed to close questions where a quick search gave an answer, and I think we’re all in agreement we want these - and we want an answer that shows how to search, why to search, and how to use the answer.

On other sites, there are some excellent guidance like MCVE on Stack Overflow in an effort to combat poorly researched and documented code questions.


https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcvehttps://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve


What I see you pointing out are questions where the asker hasn’t isolated the issue or documented why they can’t self-research an answer or way to troubleshoot.

If that’s the real issue you see, we have the beginnings of a close reason for the “lacks basic troubleshooting” and the proper way to handle these is a -1 vote if the question is not useful or not clear. A constructive comment if there’s really no way to do the work for someone.

About the only way to answer these questions is if Apple has published how to troubleshoot the issue and you could answer - here’s a framework to isolate what’s happening, please ask a follow on question once you’ve done the work to isolate the issue to a specific error or one step in this troubleshooting guide.

I see your question to be really about us helping people feel more comfortable closing questions for the off topic reason:


  Questions must demonstrate a reasonable amount of research & understanding of the problem being solved. Please edit to either a) clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it or b) include attempted solutions plus why they didn't work. In either case, be sure your expected results are clearly presented.


Do you see any examples of questions you are uncertain to vote to close using the above reason when they are really lacking basic troubleshooting?

Lastly, don’t confuse Help Vampire with rules of thumb. If troubleshooting is really a manifestation of someone exhibiting symptoms from this post - just walk away from that post and disengage.


https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/258206/what-is-a-help-vampirehttps://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/258206/what-is-a-help-vampire
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/43478/exit-strategies-for-chameleon-questionsExit strategies for "chameleon questions"




So if I were to categorize certain questions you might be tempted to close:


Can you do my debugging / troubleshooting for me? - bad - Vote to close if research and results aren’t up to community standards.
Can you search for me how to solve a specific clear issue? - good - Answer with where to find the answer and possibly how you found that or what knowledge let you connect the dots.
Can you do my thinking / homework / work for me? - bad - Vote to close if research and results aren’t up to community standards.
Can you read my mind (or https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/527/how-to-address-the-xy-problem-in-this-question-and-a-potential-problem-with-onean XY problem)? - bad - You may have to think how to vote / answer this, but in the end, if we could read minds, wouldn’t we be out making millions of dollars and then retiring on the beach spending money on friends and family?

It could be a group or owner issue...a rogue process. He may be trying to delete a file inside a compressed volume. He seems to have done basic troubleshooting at an amateur user level. Maybe we could have a flag for "may require extended troubleshooting?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BillSmith In that case, if it’s immediately obvious, then the question is clear enough for someone that cares to answer. We shouldn’t close it if we know how to answer it. Now, others may and will vote to close when _they_ don’t know how to answer it, and that’s not wrong. The system can correct that vote to close when needed and someone knows how to answer it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...or consider https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/358580/annoying-prompt-keeps-popping-up-the-cc-command-requires-the-command-line-de/358582?noredirect=1#comment474197_358582 - I'm hesitant to put in a ton of time to figure out his unique situation because ultimately he will want the same apps installed and will install the command line tools.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BillSmith Walk away from that comment thread. Help Vampire tendencies are being exhibited there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Help vampire? Would love an explanation...sounds very Game of Thronesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BillSmith I did a Google Search for "Help Vampire" and got https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/258206/what-is-a-help-vampire


















Yes, yes we are bored with things that keep asking the same question showing that people don’t like to read the Apple article on what resolutions are supported and how to figure out external displays.

But, we still have to be kind and politely ignore them if they aren’t so bad as to be closed as lacking basic research or basic troubleshooting.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/358983/why-do-so-many-insist-on-using-google-chrome-instead-of-safariWhy do so many insist on using Google Chrome instead of Safari?


Would it make sense to change a couple things and reopen this question if it fits under the guidelines of https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/Good Subjective, Bad Subjective?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we make this question stronger with facts and references?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC That’s such a great link and article, I added it in the call to action in the body of the question. Thanks for making the direct connection for us that I didn’t make clear initially.



















Safari is incredibly more CPU efficient


This needs references and a benchmark so no one can dispute in what ways this is a trade off.


Battery life is dramatically better if you use Safari vs Chrome


This is redundant. If Safari is more efficient, then this is patently true. If not, it’s patently false - it should be deleted IMO. I’ve already edited that out (and the CPU portion of the memory “beef”


Incredible developer tools like Instruments (just enable the "Develop" menu)


This is incomplete. Chrome has dev tools, safari has dev tools - this might be a good answer, but shouldn’t be part of the question IMO.


Safari fares much better in terms of security. Google Chrome is comparable to user-installed malware.


Needs references or an objective measure


Excluding extensions that have security risks, Safari has a comparable list of available extensions.


I’m lost here what the point Bill is trying to stake out. Need help on that, but hopefully this critique is seen as wanting the question to live and get good answers, and not just being mean spirited. I mean what I say about Bill being positive and astute above, so I wanted to end with positivity so no one thinks I’m ranting here on anything but the first draft of this question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The title might also benefit from a more neutral wording, inviting additional facts rather than opinion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The opinion angle is one thing. But even bigger imo is: how to encourage As that are fact based *and valid in 6 months time?* FF got much better on battery, speed with Quantum, Safari took away almost all extensions I used in v12+, etc. -> Browsers change a lot and the race is always on. A Q still useful in 2020+ should lean away from 'here's one fish' towards 'this is how to use the net'.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well said @LangLangC - I was hoping to at least draw some line in the sand - we’re measuring X type of site or Y benchmark and at least how to measure this would help people repeat the test as things change in addition to making a snap judgement based on today’s browsers. I find the notion of not having 4 browsers quaint. I use the browser that works best for each type of site as well as having a couple browsers lets me segment cookies / have some more secure by default than others.


















YES -- in the main room, please

I don't see a reason, not to put in the main room.  

A separate room means that someone has to prevent freezing every 14 days.  This is a bit of an inconvenience and can lead to someone forgetting or getting lazy, which apparently, has happened before.

Currently the main chat isn't very active. New messages are posted once every couple of hours. The feed posts once every couple of hours also. So I don't think the feed is going to crowd the main chat room to interrupt someones conversation.

Other sites have a feeds in their main chat rooms. (e.g. Stack Overflow, many of the language chat rooms have feeds without a separate room).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But the freezing problem is solved by having *conscripted an automated bot* for the separate room! No AskD human user is needed any longer for anti-freeze activity. (And participation is hopefully increasing a bit in both rooms? ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC I don't understand. Is the feed, enough to prevent freeze?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No. The feeds don't count and are useless for that. We tried that and it failed, quickly. But the user GenericBot is our bouncer: always present, monitoring activity, and after 5 days of no-shows and no activity, he posts a short no-freezer, fully automated. *He* is enough to prevent freezing. Good guy.


















I’ve seen several issues punted to the Unix/Linux or StackOverflow exchanges, but that’s problematic.

Many things are unique to the Apple platforms. 

Thanks to Darwin’s UNIX underpinnings and FreeBSD roots, it shares a common ancestry with Linux, but it would be foolish to consider them the same, especially when it comes to software development. 

I don’t know if we need more and better tagging, or an exchange explicit to development for Apple environments, but sending someone to sift through Linux tech when they’re coding for macOS/iOS is not right. For that matter, I’ve seen a few networking issues lately where some poor soul thought macOS honors Linux/UNIX configuration files.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should software development related issues be handled?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you add some specific examples of such questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5closed questions are easily handled by the collaborative moderation team of hundreds of users with 3k rep. Without some examples of this, it’s going to be hard to make consensus on meta. Also, what is “punted” - is that short for successfully migrated or something else?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll try to track down the questions that led me to post this question. By punted, I mean that it was suggested that the poster seek an answer on the Unix/Linux or StackOverflow exchanges. My concern is that for some questions, the non-macOS answer is quite wrong and only someone experienced with Darwin/Apple OS would be able to provide the correct answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Example: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/359534/ios-mac-os-local-notifications-behind-the-scene/359538#359538 -- If the user looks up NSNotification, they'll find a full description.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That’s clearly a dev level question and one of the commenters pointed them (appropriately) to Stack Overflow.  I personally pointed them to the dev documentation on Apple’s site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So you're saying that "Ask Different" doesn't handle developer-level questions, even if the Apple answer differs considerably from the non-Apple OS answer? If that's true, okay. It just seems wrong. There was another question regarding network peer setup that I'd like to present for consideration as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess that when someone is obviously not trolling or being lazy, I think it's important to at least send them in the right direction.

On StackOverflow or UL, they'll most likely get a Linux-correct answer that will have them pulling their hair out wondering why it doesn't work like everyone says it should.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, as mentioned in https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic, code-level/development questions are off-topic. For most of them, SO is the right place to ask (assuming one adheres to the rules defined there), and as long as the poster mentions that they are using macOS/iOS they should get good answers. UL mostly is useful for shell-level things, not so much for development (and there is an overlap in case of shell-scripting for instance). Even there, mentioning macOS should get good answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to propose a policy change please raise a new question on meta (here) with your proposal.


















We already have a procedure in place for dealing with Software Development questions and that is to close as such and point the user to Stack Overflow which is a community geared specific to that activity.   It’s also important to note the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3317/119271question typically isn’t migrated but instead closed.
Software development questions should never be migrated to UNIX/Linux.

For that matter, I’ve seen a few networking issues lately where some poor soul thought macOS honors Linux/UNIX configuration files.

macOS ≠ Linux
Why would macOS honor Linux config files?  In fact it doesn’t have to honor any particular file to https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3648.htmremain certified.   For example in FreeBSD  and Solaris, which are both certified, I had a resolv.conf file which I could specify the priority of hostname lookups or even prevent hostname resolution from the /etc/hosts file rendering it neuter.
If true, it is troubling that we would send a user to look at “Linux” tech for an answer on macOS, but without context, we can’t address it

Thanks to Darwin’s UNIX underpinnings and FreeBSD roots, it shares a common ancestry with Linux....

I’m not sure why Linux is assumed to be the genesis of Unix and Unix-like operating systems, but macOS doesn’t share ancestry with it. Darwin is, in and of itself, a bona fide Unix.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, Linux is derived from the UNIX's, intended to be a cheap/GNU version of them. Darwin is UNIX, and is higher in the food chain than Linux, on par with Solaris and SCO which were only available as paid/commercial OS.


















Thanks, I've reached out to the user. Moderators can cancel bounties if needed.

Really grateful to interact with so many knowledgable folks here. What's really nice is that most of them are regular and pretty active.

Really value how all the regular folks contribute in such positive manner without any bias. I feel fortune to have the opportunity to interact with everyone.

There's something new to learn every single day, which keeps me bringing to the website. Every regular contributor has a distinct strong area and it's nice to have a community with such diverse skill set.

Kudos to @Monomeeth to taking time out from him busy schedule and compile the statistics. Have seen you inactive on the site for quite some time, missing your really comprehensive answers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your kind words Nimesh! :) Life has been busier than expected, but hoping things will quieten down soon. And yes, I'm also very thankful for all the folks who contribute regularly and usually in a positive way. We're very fortunate to have them! :)


















Don't worry, this happens to all of us and therefore it's a good thing that Suggested Edits require two reviewers.

You https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/179612/295232cannot change your decision, the system simply doesn't allow it. Even ♦ moderators cannot change your review, though of course we can review the suggested edits ourselves (just like two regular users would).

What you could do is navigate to the edit page of the post (https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/<post id>/edit) and improve the post yourself - this will reject the pending edit as conflicting with yours. Of course, this should only be done if there's actually anything to improve in the post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another unrelated question. When trying to accept your answer, I got a message stating "You can accept an answer in 6 minutes". What is causing it? I remember it takes some time before I can accept my own answer, but what is happening here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's by design: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/44099/295232 For a self-answer, the limit is 48 hours instead of 15 minutes. You're much more likely to encounter those messages.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question's ID is in the URL, after `/questions/`, e.g. `https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3560/revert...` -> post ID is 3560. For answers, either copy it over from the revisions list, or click 'share', which gives you `https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3561/121968`, the post ID is the first number, after `/a/`, so 3561.


















Is it possible to suggested edits or improvements to the Ask Different https://apple.stackexchange.com/tourTour page?

If yes, how to do it? Is it directly accessible for edits (just like other Q&A posts) to normal users (non-moderators) or does the changes have to be communicated to the site moderators?

Do elected site moderators have access to the tools to directly edit the Tour page?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can one improving/suggest edits to the Tour pageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great question - since this is about the process - please feel free to make a specific recommendation for change if you want to see if there is consensus to make that change in a follow on question.


















I wanted to hi-light recent changes to the https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/hacking/infohacking tag on the main site.

I took out all the “dictionary” definition from the excerpt and made it 100% about usage guidance - what should be tagged and what shouldn’t.

Are these edits keeping with group consensus on what we should expect from this tag?

Once that’s established - we can see about retagging questions if needed if some of the usage for this tag is outside the usage guidelines.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag guidance spotlight - is the hacking tag representative of group consensus?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have [rejected the tag wiki](https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/265258) on the grounds of being [copied content](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26361/hacking) without attribution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Haven't checked what's tagged in this way. But it feels quite unfortunate that this partial and negative aspect of a two-part meaning seems to prevail. Compare the original, positive  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker  Perhaps a synonym of "criminal activities", "system intrusion" or other more direct phrases might be better? For me, "hacking" is much more 'understanding', 'engineering', 'tinkering' 'fun with technology' etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC I would support that as well, but without consensus here it’s going to be very hard to change the prevailing usage.


















I proposed this feature in Chat a while ago and haven't had any complaints, but I wanted to ask the community before I added it.

I have developed a bot and would like to add it to the https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chatAsk Different Chat main room. It is https://github.com/jbis9051/SO-ChatBotopen source and the plugin API is extremely simple so people can add their own functionality. People can also request a feature that we can decide if we would like to implement. I have written extensive documentation on how everything works https://github.com/jbis9051/SO-ChatBot/blob/master/docs/CHAT_API.mdhere (feel free to add if you can).

Many other chat rooms have their own bots for various functions. Welcoming new users to chat, stating rules, auto moderation (can help mods find bad questions), fun commands (increases chat activity), post links to questions based on certain criteria (better version of Feed), and many other functions. Ask Different might benefit from a command to search for Apple Support articles, etc.

If you want to test the bot you can do so https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/193540/test-my-bothere. The command prefix is || (pipe character). The Help menu can be accessed by || help and the format is || command_name arg1 arg2.

Please upvote or downvote the features you agree/disagree with (see answers below).

This is a discussion, so please share any feedback, concerns or suggestions you may have. Also feel free to add your own answers and proposals!

I hope that we can add the bot. :)



If you down voted (or upvoted), please consider adding a comment with your thoughts. I think any opposition should be discussed. Maybe it can be addressed, or if not there will at least be a post for future people on why a bot doesn't exist on this site.

Thank you so much for proposing this discussion. +1 for thatb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Glad to see you've come this far! :) I remember you saying how complicated SE's chat API was to work with, so kudos to you for sticking it out! :) I think some of the functions you reference show some promise, so I agree with @bmike - adding an answer with a specific function will give users something more specific to vote on. If you want, feel free to post multiple answers - one for each function - so we get a sense of the level of support generally. Otherwise, start with one first and, if that gets up, we can expand from there if/when necessary. All the best with it! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Done. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth Done. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's great. Thanks! :)


















Proposal Title: Apple Support Search Command

Description:

Currently I have setup commands for both Wikipedia and MDN:

|| mdn Array
|| wiki Apple


It allows people to easily search for commons things without leaving chat.

I propose an Apple Support version of this. Using a command, people could search Apple Support or anything else to find support articles. I often link official support articles in my answers so it would be nice to be able to search them in chat with a command. Additionally, if someone is asking a question in chat you can use the command to show them a relevant support article. This is very similar to the MDN command in the JavaScript chat. 



This command has been added to the test bot || aps [query]

Not sure it would harm the main one eitherb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike How do you think it might harm the main room? Not opposed to separate room, just want to get discussion going :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don’t think it can harm the main room, you can always remove it. I think it might turn people off prematurely. It also might get critical mass. Hard to tell if a gradual intro will help or hurt.


















I read https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/360667/88313this question about giving your iPhone & passcode to another person.  The OP asked


  What's the things the can do and what trace would be around to identify that action?


To my reading and understanding, the OP was asking a hypothetical question.  Maybe that wasn't the intention but the OP has an extensive history on SE sites so I'm sure they knew what was in-scope and out-of-scope for this site.

I voted to close the question as 'too broad' because the question is so wide and encompasses so many variables that the only real answer is between 'everything' and 'nothing'.  If you give your device and passcode to someone then they can do everything you can do with your device.

So I was surprised to see not one but two site mods contribute edits and an answer to this question (bmike and nimesh-neema).  Nimesh even stated that it was a 'very good question' although he didn't actually fully answer the questions raised as of this writing. (no insult, nimesh, just using this as an example).  

I'm struggling to understand how such a broad question would be considered on-topic for this site?

If the OP had only asked something along the lines of "For <insert app name here>, how can I trace the actions that someone with my passcode executed?", at least I would consider that a focused, specific question that can be answered.  I debated editing the question down to something similar to that but decided against it on the grounds that it might violate the intent of the author.

This should go without saying but I'm going to state it anyway: I'm not trying to insult anyone associated with this question.  I just trying to understand how mods and I can see a question so differently.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was this question not closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your call on editing was a good one. It may need a heavy hand to guide it towards good and away from the rocks.


















It’s one of those “looks really bad questions” that might really turn useful so I didn’t cast a binding vote to close on it. I don’t think I’d override a community close, though without getting consensus here. 

I did edit I heavily - it should have been closed IMO when it had much of an answer in the body. 

It could get some awesome crowd sourcing or it could be a dud. 


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23577/how-many-genius-mixes-are-there-in-itunesHow Many Genius Mixes Are There in iTunes?


It could really be a place for the community to gather, or it could fizzle out. 


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17759/what-tiny-thing-in-lion-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guardWhat tiny thing in Lion makes you smile or has caught you off guard??


I’m willing to give it a shot to get off the ground at this point. You are absolutely correct that this is borderline against the rules and if too many of these are asked, they aren’t healthy and should be the exception and not the rule. 

Without a great answer within a week or two, it probably should get closed is my guess, but I suspect a very good answer might be doable in a few days time. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the answer and examples, bmike.  I like the 'crowdsourced' aspect.  Maybe having a `crowdsource` tag would be good for these types of questions as long as they don't devolve into Twitter polls.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can assure you @fsb if this devolves, it will get shut down. Please flag if needed or @ me or other mods if that happens or this becomes a trend for a specific user or topic. Everything here is designed to be crowdsourced, sometimes people need a hint or a big problem to undertake it, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The two Q you cite have been turned into community wikis, which among other things also throws more light on the "crowdsourcing" aspect. May be an option for the iPhone question as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside I'd second that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Isn't that a strange logic? "Close if no good A in a few days"? AFAIK "close" should prevent As (likely bad; but can be good [reversal badge]) to a bad Q. But precedence should go to: Q is bad, or not? Some good Q aren't easy to answer, some can't some just don't get an A. In other words: presence of answer is a very weak indicator of Q-quality, if at all?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC I don't follow. My point is that even though it might look bad, I personally don't think it is actually bad. But I didn't want  the community to have to agree with my opinion. I did think it needed an edit and perhaps some help making a good answer better, but that's already done and already in progress.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Without a great answer within a week or two, it probably should get closed" is strange, and even stranger if you mean by that "without a good edit" (of the Q). Whether a Q is good/bad shouldn't be determined on whether there comes a good A along in a a given timeframe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It already has a good answer. I believe we judge questions for their capacity to have a good answer. The only reason for a question is to host answers, so the presence of good answers makes it easier for me to argue that a question should stay open. We should probably not over analyze this one question and have a new thread if/when we get a couple questions together and can speak in generalities and not worry too much about this one incarnation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder if there’s anything good in this podcast on how to grade questions - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/328475/unicorn-meta-zoo-3-how-do-we-grade-questions - we used to have a podcast where people got together to discuss this.

This has been a pending item in my bucket list for well over a decade. I wish to cross it out soon :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can the post be edited to include image from the [media invite](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7LvB18XoAAacy8.jpg:large) card?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NimeshNeema It's on my bucket list as well! :) As for the image, the reason I didn't include the full version was just so the post didn't take up too much space. But I suppose we can resize it so it's not so big, so I'll do that now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5:). I hand code using `` tag when attaching images to a post to have full control over the size.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NimeshNeema Yeah, that's what I ended up doing. Great minds think alike! LOLb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The WWDC 2019 Keynote just concluded. Thanks Monomeeth and @grg for hosting the event and making everyone aware. Thanks Monomeeth for welcoming everyone. I am waiting for the video to release and will share a written summary of the announcements soon!



















  To my reading and understanding, the OP was asking a hypothetical question


I agree that the situation could be hypothetical, but the implications are real.


  I voted to close the question as 'too broad' because the question is so wide and encompasses so many variables that the only real answer is between 'everything' and 'nothing'.


I agree with your point here.


  If you give your device and passcode to someone then they can do everything you can do with your device.


I agree that the question clearly appears falling under 'too broad' domain. But in my understanding, sometimes it's difficult to make a clear distinction separating 'too broad' and 'not broad'. The answer may encompass broad areas, but I felt it's possible to list down clear points of threat, which I feel is the intent of question to compile. I saw this question to be roughly similar to one like this:


  
  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/please-share-your-hidden-macos-features-or-tips-and-tricksPlease share your hidden macOS features or tips and tricks
  


Too broad to be answered, but could make up for a helpful post. I second bmike's commentary regarding crowd sourcing aspect. This exact thought was in my mind when I started answering the question.


  Nimesh even stated that it was a 'very good question' although he didn't actually fully answer the questions raised as of this writing.


I have redacted that statement (even before reading this post on meta), as I felt that the statement was irrelevant as far as the answer is concerned, and was just a personal commentry. As far as the answer goes, I'd really like other answers to be posted, highliting areas that I may have missed. I would myself continue to add to it as I discover relevent points.


  (no insult, nimesh, just using this as an example).


None taken :) We are all hear to build a healthy/democratic community.


  I was surprised to see not one but two site mods contribute edits and an answer to this question (bmike and nimesh-neema)


I am not an elected/site moderator :), just an average Joe user like everybody else. I do remain very active at times.



The interesting aspect of the question for me is this:


  What trace would be around to identify those actions?


As you can notice in the latest version of the answer, it is possible to identify certain areas where iOS plays guard, (for e.g. by asking to verify new fingerprints/facial data by entering the Apple ID password) in restricting a stranger from making impactful changes with the limited access they have to the device. Also, some loop holes were identified (such as gaining access to 3rd-party apps protected behind Touch ID/Face ID authentication).

This particular aspect of the question made it appealing to me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well said. I would quibble about the moderator part. Both you and @fsb are moderators here. There are many moderators and most are not elected. They are appointed by group vote and showing up. Both of you are highly qualified mods in my eyes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Totally agree with @bmike - your input is highly valued. Trust me, without users such as yourselves *moderating*, this site wouldn't exist!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks Nimesh!  I appreciate you providing this detail.  The main reason I asked this question is learn more about how you and bmike saw this question and why you both responded the way you did.  You've both helped me learn a bit more today and, hopefully, that will help me be a better 'citizen' mod.


















Fixed :-) The rendering is a bit picky regarding the placing of . and space characters in quoted lists. See the https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/360783/revisionsedit for the specific change required (well, actually, I only changed one character at item 1 and 4).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh no - I should have seen that. Thanks!


















I wanted to address what was raised in chat today where some reputation changes were made and many of the highest reputation people decreased substantial amounts of reputation (and by substantial - for our site I classify that as between 500 and 1000 reputation points).

If you haven't seen this or read the help page, you might still be confused or disappointed to realize that reputation here can are adjusted when an account is removed - the normal process is to reverse the votes that now deleted account has cast.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/user-was-removedhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/user-was-removed


This removal of reputation on accounts that are new and don't vote much or don't affect people substantially is automatic and routine. What isn’t routine is if an account has voted on quite a few posts - the automatic deletion goes to a human employee to check if they want to over-ride the normal deletion for reasons. The main meta has several threads on this and why a human might choose to keep some or all of the votes rather than have them all revert.

What happened today was neither routine nor automatic and a human (currently the community managers / stack exchange employees) took affirmative action to approve an account deletion and approve that did adjust downward as this user did very few downvotes (those deductions were refunded - and people got rep gains) and very many upvotes ( which gave people rep losses ).


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/125740/dont-throw-away-all-votes-when-a-user-is-deletedDon't throw away all votes when a user is deleted (the old question) and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/328646/change-the-criteria-for-vote-retention-upon-account-removalChange the criteria for vote retention upon account removal (The new proposal to revisit the old decision)
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126470/what-does-user-was-removed-mean-and-why-did-my-reputation-change-because-of-itWhat does "user was removed" mean and why did my reputation change because of it?
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/328642/massive-user-removal-in-one-nightMassive user removal in one night?


The three links above are the best ones I have to illustrate how and why this happened. I personally don't see our current help system matching the reality of what happens when users that have voted quite a bit here then get deleted/removed, so please vote up my request on main meta to make the help more clear if you agree with more clarity on this.


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/328672/please-update-the-text-in-help-for-user-was-removed-reputation-changesPlease update the text in help for "User was Removed" reputation changes


Let me know if we want to make any other changes or you have more information / context on this in the answer section. Also, this isn't about whether we agree with removing votes or not, but this is about explaining what happened and why within the world view that it can and does happen to remove reputation.

We would want a new thread if people want to agitate / advocate to change this entirely
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do my eyes deceive me? Lots of people lost a lot of reputation todayb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for sharing this. I really hope a lot of new active users who are not aware of this or have seen this for the first time will find it useful. I'd like to ask a related question. I understand if a user delete their account themselves and they are not very high rep, it may cause other members to lose/gain rep points based on the users voting patterns. What I'm interested in knowing is what criterion is used by the mod team if the choose delete to delete an account(s) and if there is any criterion for deletion in the first place. I have observed substantial rep loses (~3.5k) in past as welb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NimeshNeema no elected moderator gets to make any choice. It’s the employees. If you read the answers to [this thread](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/328672/please-update-the-text-in-help-for-user-was-removed-reputation-changes) you can hear directly from an employee (they also have diamonds, but they are not elected - they are hired/appointed)


















Was not significant this time around, just lost a measly 85 rep points:



But I had a 'Month of Ouch' back in January:

https://wwdcbysundell.comWWDC by Sundell

Daily coverage of Apple’s WWDC 2019 conference, by John Sundell.

This may be an interesting resource for all the Apple developer folks hanging out on https://apple.stackexchange.comAsk Different.

Apart from WWDC keynote which happens on the opening day which announces the new operating systems for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS, a ton of other events and sessions take place throughout the week. Notable are The Developer State of Union and plethora of technical sessions where engineers present and dissect the changes to the APIs and tooling.

WWDC by Sundell aims to cover WWDC for folks who may not be able to attend in person.


  However, not everyone is able to actually attend WWDC in person. Not only do you have to win the “lottery” in order to qualify for purchasing a ticket, you also need to have the monetary means to be able to fly to, stay at, and attend the conference. So for a huge amount of people, WWDC can feel a bit out of reach.
  
  I wanted to do something about that. This website is for everyone who wants to closely follow WWDC, but from anywhere in the world. Starting right now, this site will be updated daily with articles, videos, podcasts, and interviews, covering all things WWDC — from recommendations on what session videos to watch, to in-depth looks at new APIs, to interviews with people from all over the Apple developer community.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for sharing this. :)


















I've posted the question and the answer below to share my thoughts and get community feedback on the action taken.



While there is nothing wrong as such with the edit (it did fix a minor issue in the post) it's worthwhile to keep the following in mind:


There are significantly bigger issues with this post than the misspelling of the name of OSX 10.11. As written the question and the problem it describes are rather hard to understand. So if you already have the editor open, why not go the full way and also improve the readability of the post as such? 
Any edit on a post will bounce the question back onto the front page. So if you edit an old post please make sure it's not only worth the edit in itself but also that fact that it pushes a more recent question off the front page.
Any edit done by users below 2000 points of reputation is placed into the review queue for suggested edits and reviewed by several high-rep users. As above, while I'm sure we have enough high-rep users to avoid a huge burden regarding the suggested edit reviews, make their time spent on the review of an edit a time well-spent


So in this case I choose to reject the edit as "doing harm", even though the harm was primarily to the review system and the users doing the review, and not so much on the post itself.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In principle, agreeable.  But the "all the way" could do with examples? What else was there to be fixed (as you see it and think worthwhile)? [That is: I see a few human language issues that are fixable, now. But ultimately I'd have to resort to a clarification comment, as I think it is just a bit too 'hard' to make out what's really asked here. Ultimately, I think if you are confident to know all what needs fixing, an edit by nohillside would give the most insight. Maybe with comments here]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC Thanks for the feedback, you are absolutely right about "show it, don't just talk about it". My main critique regarding the question is along the same lines as yours: It's hard to understand and contains a lot of irrelevant stuff. If I would have stumbled across it shortly after it was posted I might have either commented accordingly or even put it on hold.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Having said that: Paragraphs 1 and 2 contain the actual question, paragraph 3 and 4 aren't really necessary at all. I understand that not all users editing questions would dare to actually remove half of the question, but in this situation it might be necessary.


















Ok, here's mine - from 4th down to 1,120th!

I don't live for rep, but admit I was looking forward to breaking the 50K barrier. Guess I'll have to wait a bit longer for that now. :( 

Oh well, patience is a virtue. LOL

https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/2622/merchako@merchako has this comment on the answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/224772/1860https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/224772/1860:


  So far, there are two questions in this comment thread that I think are highly relevant to establishing a good answer to this question. I believe the follow-up questions should be included because (1) they're highly depended on this question, and (2) they would help determine what makes a good answer. In contrast, @GrahamMiln has recommended both of them be separate questions. Can we get a reference or an opinion from a third party to establish what the right approach would be?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to address follow on questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel no obligation to address comments containing extensions, additions, or modifications on _accepted_ answers. In these situations, I frequently suggest to those commenting to ask a new question. I understand comments are not indexed and will effectively disappear; where-as a new question has a chance to attract attention and address the commenter's situation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There definitely is no obligation. If people feel strongly about a topic they can and should ask a new question and not hijack existing answers (or question). I probably should include that in my answer below :-)


















The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/promotionrelevant Help Center article states:

How not to be a spammer
The community here tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers.

It's not explicitly mentioned, but this means that if you're not affiliated with a product you recommend, you're not required to disclose so. Especially if it's a widely used tool like Sublime or BBEdit; when done repeatedly, that would quickly be perceived as noise, distracting from the main content.
Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with either of those.

In the case of closing duplicates, Community acts on behalf of the author of the question.

When a question receives a vote to close as duplicate, the author of the question is prompted that it is suspected their question is a duplicate. The author then has the ability to agree with the duplicate and have their question marked as such, or to disagree and edit the question. If the author chooses the former option, the question is closed as duplicate by Community.


  


https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/250981/222623New UI encourages askers to confirm or dispute duplicate votes

From time to time, I see a lot of editing being done that can be described as "merely a linguistic style choice", rather than a correction to spelling or a clarification of the question at hand. Often, these edits are made to years-old threads, asked and answered; and so the edits achieve little except bringing the posts back to the top of the lists.

I have had edits made to my posts (which I rolled back) that were essentially just alterations to the way I'd written something, rather than an amelioration of the content. I'd hope I don't presume too much in suggesting that my English usage does not normally require much assistance.

I'm not talking about formatting, which is of some value.

Is such a practice desirable? To my mind, if every question and answer sounds as though it has come from the same author, then something has been lost from the community.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Editing for style rather than contentb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you see a pattern, can you maybe flag some of the edited posts so we can have a look?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Upvoted as I can see the same in various StackExchange communities (not only this one).  I don’t post much, but I see most of my posts edited unable to spot what has been edited.  So, it appears that such edits are being done just to get the editor’s names out and visible (a.k.a. attention hashing).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is an absolute pet hate of mine. I recently left one SE community [with 20k rep] after relentless minor style edits from one of the moderators, who just couldn't resist "fixing" things that weren't broken.


















I've noticed that whenever I start a answer with either the word hello or hi, that word has been removed when I post the answer or attempt to update it. A few things I've noticed about this:


Either word having any uppercase characters doesn't stop it from being removed
If you change the spelling, like helo and hy, the words aren't removed
They only get removed if you start the question or answer with it
I've only observed/tested this on/with an answer, but I noticed that the question I was answering started with Hy, but the rest of the spelling (of the question) was fine, leading me to believe that this was done on purpose
It also removes any punctuation that is directly after the word (for example: Hello,. The comma would be removed with the word hello or hi)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hello/hi removed in questions and answersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5hi. (Simply could, of resist) are you asking for a more expansive / strict filter here? If you could edit this to show the results you wish to see, this can be considered as a bug request. If not, it’s more discussion and should be retagged.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike no, I'm not asking for filter changes. This is a bug I've noticed. Should I re-tag it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. If you don’t propose a change, it’s not really a b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, does that mean that it's part of the filter?


















This is by design, but I don’t know if this list is still current on the code.

The sentiment that chit chat does not belong in any post is deeply embedded in the community since the value of a post is highest and most durable when the question is succinct and crystal clear. 

Answers get a little more latitude, since the great ones have a clear succinct answer and then also elaboration as to context, or why the answer is correct.

Proposal

Since questions about


  AppleScript, Automator, and UNIX shell scripting


are on-topic here, more impetus should be given to the questioner to include the script they have used. 

Reference


Stack Overflow has a dedicated page for the same. https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-exampleHow to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example. Also even before the choice between traditional and guided question mode is given, it is asked to have code handy. 
Code review, under Asking your question on https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askHow do I ask a good question?, has addressed the issue. 


Examples

These are some of the latest under https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applescriptapplescript or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/automatorautomator, where code was required. 

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/364453/using-automator-to-parse-url#comment485194_364453Using automator to parse URL

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/364420/folder-action-on-dropbox-runs-more-than-once#comment485086_364420Folder Action on Dropbox Runs More Than Once

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/364452/error-50-in-apple-automator#comment485198_364452Error 50 in Apple Automator

One of them arguably lacks proper research, but what is common, is the lack of the script they tried or pseudocode of what they want to try. 

Suggestions

Since we accept questions similar to both of the sites', we should also add   a paragraph in https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askHow do I ask a good question? under Be specific.

Or:The relevant tags in the usage wiki can have the same info included because the asker might possibly read the tag wiki tag as compared to the how to ask.

Can I suggest you edit your question to propose a specific paragraph and the page (eg. our [How do I ask a good question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) page etc) you'd like to see the paragraph added to? Keep in mind that, unlike Code Review, we don't have a problem with *broken code* questions, so we can't just reuse their paragraph. Once you've done this we'll have something more definitive to work with. Thanks again for taking the time to propose this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth Welcome! While I am comparing *how do I as a good question* pages, ours has some more problems. This might make my edit broader than the title. I am trying to keep it...  *what do I say? narrow?*....  Also, the ranking of this page in the list of FAQ's is very low as compared to 3rds etc on others.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just a quick note: Unlike Code Review or SO we do get questions from people who heard about scripting but haven't wrote any line of code yet (or ever). So while it's definitively a good idea to ask for code if the asker already has some, don't make it too restrictive :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Should I write an answer post with the  last part and keep it up for revisions? Making everyone write another answer with slight and overlapping modifications is ugly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Posting an answer with a proposal for the wording is ok for me, we can use edits and comments to improve if necessaryb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: [Ask Different question checklist](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3387/ask-different-question-checklist)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tetsujin The list is comprehensive and much more useful than my proposal. But as fsb had pointed out, its usage is unclear. If that can be incorporated into an article, or maybe users should link the question itself when they see a low quality  question, that would be great. Also, Most of the points seem to be incorporated in the answer below. If you see something, more or less, I would love to see changes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wanted to update you we’ve had some mod discussions on how we would move forward with an actual change. This isn’t something we can just edit on the fly so it would be good to A) Get more up votes here to indicate broad support - +3 is pretty thin - we could move forward with low votes, but it would be nice to see this more positive B) I’m going to suggest we borrow heavily from the main FAQ / perhaps add a new item there to get advice and input from other sites - if many sites come together to have a better “be specific” this will be awesome and help us all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Thanks for updating! Yes I totally agree with A. I did try to attract more views/votes, chatroom of IPS, pinging etc. For B, I haven't thought of FAQ for better/coherent phrasing between sites. I just checked the code sites' pages. As for adding a point there, title would have to be rephrased as the issue at hand grows from asking for code to editing *Be specific* completely. you should recommend who should go asking for inputs on meta.SE?


















To reduce the emphasis on code, another problem of repetitively asking OS versions and devices should be addressed too. Some parts copied from SO.

Be specific

If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.


"It doesn't work" isn't descriptive enough to help people understand your problem. Instead, tell other readers which steps you took, what the result was and where/how it didn't match your expectations.
Include relevant versions. It helps checking against software release notes for the possible bug.
Include how to reproduce your error messages by showing:


your code
your command that invokes the code
your errors when invoking the script (or code)



Consider adding one tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scriptingscripting or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/automationautomation in addition to the specific script or OS in question. The easier we can see what you expect from a result and how you are running, the more chance we’ll try and reproduce your situation and write up an awesome anwswer. Without clear details, answers will be more like “Have you tried X” as well as sending you here to help improve the details on your question.

I tried commenting on an answer, and all of my paragraphs were strung together in a single paragraph.

I used proper markdown, adding two spaces at the end of each paragraph.  When that didn't work, I tried appending a <br/> to the end of my paragraphs, but that didn't work either!  (In fact, the <br/> was rendered in my answer, instead of being interpreted as HTML.)

What was I doing wrong?

I've undeleted the question; even though it might not be useful for the author anymore, you might be able to help future visitors with a similar problem.

Note that as a 10k user, you can flag posts like these for ♦ moderator attention. That's probably quicker, and that way we keep Meta for questions about Ask Different where everybody can participate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, posting a question on Meta is not *wrong*; moderators get notified about those as well.


















I want to know what the "official" definition here is, of "extended discussions", because when the comments under an answer are being used to further troubleshoot or gain relevance to said answer, and then some moderator moves the comments to a chat, making it more difficult to discuss because you now have to flip back and forth between the main post and the chat, trying to correlate between the two.  If the comments are actually being used purely for conversational purposes, I'm in agreement with moving them to chat, but when they pertain solely to the answer or original question being asked, I think they need to stay with the main question.

I am commenting as I also flagged one.


















Thanks for raising this here, as it's always good to try and hash these things out.

Since you're referring to the fact the comments to this https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/367784/168832answer were moved to chat, and since I'm the moderator responsible for that decision, I'd like to start by saying that this was a 50/50 scenario for me. 

We had started getting flags about the number of comments on this post (22 comments from memory), so we really needed to take a closer look.

Stack Exchange sites are designed deliberately to not work like forums. Instead they work best when posts are presented as a question followed by one or more answers. The aim is to make this site one of the best (if not the best) resources for finding solutions to issues people have with their Apple products or services. And, having a question and/or answer followed by a lengthy discussion does not achieve that for most end users who really just come here looking for a solution to their problem.  

So, in summary I am guided by the fact that Stack Exchange sites:


  ...allow for limited discussion in the form of comments: if you can
  resolve a dispute or tease out the real question in a few short
  messages, then it usually works... and works better still if you can
  then update the question/answer to reflect what was agreed upon. But
  regardless of purpose, long, involved conversations are, by design and
  by decree, discouraged.


https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/35854Source

In summary, while I agree the discussion was relevant to this post, I had to weigh up the user experience overall and the best way to preserve the thought processes involved in the troubleshooting process. By moving the comments to chat I sought to:


improve the user experience of those who may come across the question looking for an answer, as it significantly reduces the amount of scrolling and hopefully results in them getting to the answer up front*
preserve the comments – whereas leaving them as comments below the post risks some of them being displayed out of order (because the system automatically collapses the list of comments and provides a link to show more comments) or, in some cases, being deleted by users even though they're still relevant. 


* That is, once the discussion is over the answer should be edited to provide the final solution without the user needing to read through all of the comments.

However, moderators are only human and we can all make mistakes. I see you've flagged this to have the comments returned, so if another Mod wants to revisit this and reverse my action, I would be totally fine with it. 

As I said, this was a 50/50 case for me, especially since there were only two of you commenting, and I concede that I could have just waited a while to see if you guys ended up getting to a final solution and cleaning things up.



As an aside, just to address the fake moderator comment – all users of the site have a role to play in moderation. It's true that as they earn more reputation points they do gain more privileges, including more moderation privileges. However, those of us who have a diamond against our name are actually https://apple.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorselected moderators. That is, they're elected by the community and have additional moderation tools regardless of how much reputation they have.

Earlier this month I asked my first question on this site. See: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/368131/i-think-my-mac-swallowed-facebook-and-twitter-how-to-get-them-backI think my Mac swallowed Facebook and Twitter - How to get them back?

Today I came back and found it had been closed as a Duplicate of this question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/343768/facebook-sharing-from-safariFacebook sharing from Safari

I disagreed with this and flagged it as follows:


  This is not a duplicate. The other question is about Facebook sharing
  from Safari. I don't even use Safari. My question is about the share
  menu in macOS itself. See my screenshots for clarification. Please
  reconsider this decision as there will be other users who do NOT use
  Safari and share directly from macOS. Thank you.


I then noticed my flag was marked with the following comment by someone (don't know who):


  helpful - Pointing the question to another is harmless unless you need
  another answer. Can you ask on meta or in chat if I’m missing
  something but I see no need to reverse the close link.


Now I'm asking on meta to see if we are all missing something?

Thank you for your deliberation. :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This duplicate - Are we missing something?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've edited the selected answer to mark why and when we reversed the close direction. Thanks so much for the time to review this request


















Thanks for bringing this up on Meta!

My main thought on the close was the fact, that sharing with FB/Twitter was fully removed in Mojave, for all applications including Finder. So whether somebody is missing the functionality in Safari, or in Finder, or in any other application relying on the standard sharing functionality available in earlier versions, the answer is always the same: the feature got removed in Mojave. 

Now, the questions are still distinct, I agree. But the idea behind closing as duplicate is to avoid duplication of answers, so if several questions basically ask the same thing from different angles, all leading to the same answer, closing as duplicate is the way to go.

PS: the fun part is that the answer you got is actually better than the answer to the original question, and your question is broader as well. So reversing the duplicate relation and closing the original as a duplicate might be an option (which I won’t pursue for the moment because it‘s a few minutes past midnight here and I need some sleep first :-))

P.P.S: we've reversed the close direction based on the quality of the answer and the quality of the question with images and better wording. Thanks for the patience while we got everyone on board with what was missing initially.

This way we avoid duplicate answers and sometimes the older question can be the one that is closed as a duplicate of the newer one if that serves the site better. That makes sense when I think about it. Thank you and good night. :)


















They don't get a notification about the deleted answer, but they do get a notification from the comments by the ♦ moderator. That's why I tend to leave a comment whenever I delete a post. As a regular user, you should still leave comments because the author might read them before their post gets deleted. Some more details can be found in https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/231990/295232this Meta Stack Exchange answer.

As you hinted at, there is some functionality to see your own recently deleted posts: the https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/current?tab=answersAnswers tab on your profile contains a link at the bottom to view them. The same functionality exists for questions.

My goal is to provide some constructive feedback to the user on why I voted the way I did and how they can have a better chance at getting their problem resolved or question answered.


















Python questions are a borderline case IMHO. Looking at the strict wording of the on-topic/off-topic pages it's probably off-topic, OTOH it's used in a lot of scripting-type scenarios (for which people tended to use bash previously) which makes them kind of on-topic (still IMHO, we didn't have a community discussion on this). That's why I tend to answer small, not directly programming/design/algorithm related python questions instead of bouncing them to SO.

The community thought otherwise in this case (as shown in the votes to close) so I had to come back to that decision this time :-)

As for the script tag: The tag definition reads


  A collection of commands that may be from a CLI Shell, or programming language such as AppleScript, which are executed in order with limited iteration, usually as a way of automating actions or events


which leaves quite lot of room for interpretation (and improvement) actually. Strictly speaking it's probably not really applicable to questions like the one mentioned above, but then I doubt the tag makes a lot of sense anyway.

PS: Regarding your comment: Telling people, especially newjoiners, to post on SO usually results in duplicated posts on both sites. If a migration is required, vote to close accordingly.

Also hinting about *Did I go wrong by adding the script tag?* completes the answer.


















Stupid me! I found the reason. My StyleSheet was still set to https://code.google.com/archive/p/adsubtract/AdSubstract.css since I-can't-remember-when, which seems to be incompatible with stack exchange.

We are talking about this question:


  https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/242748/87092How to schedule airplane mode?



Jun 15, 2016 — I asked the question how to schedule the Airplane Mode on my iPhone.
Got answer mentioning it was not possible
Marked it as correct
Sep 30, 2019 — I updated my iOS version and discovered the Shortcuts app and set up two automations: to enable the Airplane Mode in the evening and to disable it in the morning.
Posted an answer on my own question and marked it correct (unmarking the previous answer that was saying that was not possible)


The author of the other answer was not very happy and commented:

I got some upvotes and a downvote without any explanation... however their answer continues to get upvotes.

I am not sure if I am missing anything here, but I would like to know what I've done wrong.

Before this recent question

taught me that JavaScript can also be used in Script Editor app, I had added AppleScript tag into it. After clarification, I tried to remove it and put the app's name. But both are synonyms. 

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/script-editorscript-editor redirects to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applescriptapplescript. 

Can we have them separated?

Can you make a proposal below as an answer for new tag descriptions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5sentence structure can have biases, so it definitely needs some edits.

Since this is a pre-existing synonym, we would need to form a team to review the questions tagged unix and perhaps re-tag those. That effort would be a considerable amount of work.

Can you make an answer here laying out why we would tag a question as belonging to a build of linux (or if we need tags for each linux build / flavor / distribution) as opposed to having one tag to cover operating systems that are unix based.

That way people can vote up or vote down the specific implementations. I probably will answer one answer saying - "let's keep all the following OS under the unix tag here" so that people that prefer that can vote for that and don't have to down vote your question so let's elect the best option and not just say - no - we won't change it.

The implementation will depend on the design, so let's get a consensus on wha the design / scope of each proposed tag looks like and then move forward with timing based on what design or scope is best liked.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wasn't suggesting separate tags - just a general one that could be used for running any distro on a mac.  The current `Unix` tag includes questions about macOS Unix executables, terminal commands etc intermingled with dual-booting (mostly) Linux.  Now one could argue there could be people dual-booting other OS's (indeed there are the tags for `bsd` and `freebsd` linked to `Unix` and `android` which isn't) but these are marginal cases.  I think it would be good to separate "*running another OS on mac*" from whatever else is dumped under the `Unix` tag as "*running Windows on mac*" is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps changing the description of the existing `Unix` tag to be "*For questions about running 'unix-like' operating systems on mac*" would be easier.  It would solve the issue and it's other current uses are covered by other tags - in most cases it would just involve deleting the `Unix` tag from such questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We have a Linux tag and it’s a synonym of Unix. So to make a change we need to address how they will differ in a meaningful manner. I appreciate you raising the discussion, just not sure I support it yet without some more detailsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lx07 We have >800 questions tagged with `unix`, and as you noticed the term is used both for non-macOS OSes (Linux, BSD etc) and for unix-like features within macOS. I agree that a restructuring would help though, assuming we get a good set of new definitions *and* a team of volunteers to clean up existing use.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lx07 Questions about `android` usually are about either syncing an Android phone to macOS or about developing for Android devices. In both cases, the unix-like aspects of Android aren't really important, so a non-related tag is fine. I would even go so far and say that any question which is tagged both `android` *and* `unix` is most probably off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside - I would be willing to go through all the `Unix` questions and remove the tag if the question *didn't* refer to running Linux/BSD etc on a mac.  It would then just require someone (with more rep) to change the tag description to something like "*For questions related to Unix like operating systems including Linux, BSD, FreeBSD etc*' similar to the Windows tags.  However I am new here and if this suggestion isn't appropriate I certainly don't want to push it - I just thought it might make it easier for people who ran other OS`s to find relevant questions to answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lx07 As bmike mentioned above: please post an answer here with a proposal for the wording of the revised tag (both the short and the long version) so the community can give feedback on it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lx07 Until that proposal is in an answer that gets some significant votes, we’ll probably hold off waiting for consensus. No need to take any further action here or on the other question. It’s not about liking it, but getting a post voted enough that it’s clear there’s consensus.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hope you're aware of the new featured question, @lx07b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ankii - I saw it - and linked to it in my question actually.  I'm not really sure any more what is the best solution but probably adding a `Linux` tag as I initially proposed here *isn't* the way forward.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lx07 Post proposed tag descriptions there and make them CW.


















I would say, no we shouldn’t break the synonym until we have a clear picture of what to move towards. 


What would Linux mean if it’s not Unix (and we should probably have a clear picture of what FreeBSD / BSD / Centos / Ubuntu / GNU vs Linux) look like if we don’t decide to continue to have one tag for all non-Apple Unix based OS questions here.


Here is a nice example of a good question that proposes specific actions on another meta - https://unix.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5166/suggested-change-of-tag-definition-for-anacondahttps://unix.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5166/suggested-change-of-tag-definition-for-anaconda

My main thinking is that for specific questions that need to differentiate between the flavors of POSIX compliant Unix based os should be asked on the Unix / Ubuntu / Android site and not here. Most questions here are going to be how to dual boot or virtual boot, and then it’s not really about the OS differences, but I’m open to some evidence or questions that show how the current tag system is hurting this site.

Both are on-topic on AD, but they are usually totally unrelated. So I would be strongly in favor of a split hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I think we need better tags, just not sure what names / scope to start with. Maybe asking a couple example questions or collecting example questions will help us get consensus. For example - [tag:command-line] should absorb / host all “Unix” questions that are really about macos and using shells IMO. Then we can restrict the usage of Unix a bit in the definition and do some clean up @nohillside


















https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/script-editorscript-editor

It is a native code editor app for macOS used to write app automation scripts in AppleScript and JavaScript. Found in /Applications/Utilities/, it can edit, run, compile and save scripts in formats like .scpt, .scptd, .applescript, .app etc.

It has been called  Script Editor and been known as Script Editor considerably longer then the very brief time it was called AppleScript Editor.

The subject pretty much says it all: Is asking a “list-like” question regarding incompatible 32-bit apps in macOS Catalina off-topic?

I am well aware list-like questions (aka: questions that inspire lists of stuff) is pretty much frowned upon on Stack Exchange sites. But considering the major shift away from 32-bit apps in macOS Catalina (10.15) in favor of a pure 64-bit OS, I think there is value in having something like this in the community.

I’m particularly thinking of folks who use legacy audio hardware with new systems from vendors that — for whatever reason — don’t have 32-bit applications or drivers. This is a fairly large macOS user community and having some comprehensive list/discussion thread would be of value and would be appreciated.

That said, I understand the downside of this kind of stuff as well: Out of control postings, “me too” posts and general noise.

So is there a way of posting a question like this here without breaking any norms?

Thanks for bringing this up in Meta first!

IMHO such questions are a bad fit for Ask Different even as a community wiki


Compatibility information people post in Ask Different may get outdated, with the poster not coming back to update it later on.
The primary point of reference for compatibility issues or inquiries should be the website of the vendor.
Vendors may have alternative products or workarounds available even if they discontinue a 32-bit application, which again is only accurate on their website.


So while I see the value of having this list, I doubt that there is a way to maintain this on Ask Different with the quality and accuracy people tend to expect from posts and answers here.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. I suppose we could have a generic question similar to [this](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/365596/168832) with a generic answer such as mine, but in the end it just refers people to an offsite resource.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or [My Question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/216019/incompatible-software-for-next-osx) which was well received.


















Catalina and iOS 13 brought in  a lot of new users and they try to be polite and helpful and write answers like:


I was having the same problem, my MacBook Pro,  model xxxx, macOS xxxx was not doing this. I was having the exact problem as you but I am explaining it in a way that I think was unique to me. I am also posting some other symptoms of the same problem. What I did to solve it was change this setting, toggle that switch and reboot.
Hope it helps.


What are the editing suggestions for such answers? Should there be a threshold, like approximately gauging what part of the answer solves the problem and exceeding it warrants an edit?
I am aware of the thanks rule which should be done along with other improvements that build up to something. However I am split over the usefulness of the details, and the clutter they create.
Often I have left answers with a line break between details and solution while removing the hope. Is there a better way?

From looking at the links you've provided most of them are the usual set of rather low-quality answers in terms of problem analysis and reproducibility of the solution (basically they tried this and that and finally it worked again). Also most of the users posting the answer haven't revisited the site since, which means we probably should focus on improving the post if possible (and not so much on educating the user).

Basically the usual rules regarding low-quality answers apply:


edit for clarity
remove fluff (like things tried which didn't solve the problem)
look out for hidden "thank you" type answers which only say that the solution provided by another answer worked. Usually these should be deleted.
look out for spam answers (which usually are easy to identify because they are low on content and primarily link to a page selling a tool/application)


PS: I don't see a relation to Catalina or iOS 10.13 though, we get these kind of answers all the time.

as an answer to questions that invite workarounds?  People might not know what others can come up with. I'm sure a lot of people sometimes get surprised by how someone else does the same thing in an unexpected way.

Reasons why I don't like them: 


Saying no simply implies


  I don't know how to do that.


which is clearly not a helpful response to a question. If a question is left unanswered, it means that those who saw it didn't know what to do. 
It might discourage some other answerers from finding workarounds.

Sometimes, the correct answer is a simple 'no' with an explanation why it is what it is.  Not all answer have to be, or need to be, complicated.  In fact, providing someone a complicated workaround could actually make the situation worse.

Your assumption that a simple answer means "I don't know how to do that" is a bit faulty.  

I'm not saying it's entirely incorrect because sometimes that is the case.  It's been my experience (a few years on this site and sites similar) that if a workaround is possible, someone will add it as either a comment ("hey, what about doing....?") or a more detailed answer ("I couldn't do it that way but I could do it this way....").

I believe flagging an answer that only provides a yes or no without anything to back it up is completely acceptable.  I would also add, telling the writer why you flagged their answer helps them learn how to craft better answers.  After all, our goal is to help people and that includes answer-writers.

I recently asked https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/373200/90136this question about disabling Siri entirely in the touch bar on the new Macbook Pro models. The question is https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/258816/how-to-completely-disable-siri-on-sierratechnically a duplicate (and was marked as such), however the answers on the dupe all use terminal/editing of config files as opposed to using System Preferences to control the touch bar.

My guess is that the dupe target was before Apple made it possible to nicely edit the touch bar (System Preference --> Keyboard --> Customize Touch Bar).

So while the dupe question is the same, the answers there no longer really apply to editing the touch bar since now there is an actual customization menu that Apple introduced. Should this be unmarked as a duplicate, or merged in some way (e.g. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/373204/90136Danill's answer migrated to the dupe)?

Question and answers considered, I don't believe this is a dupe, but it's really close so I'm not sure what to do here...

Take a look at [this answer from a similar issue](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2272/88313) as to what you're asking (I guess, technically, your question here could be marked as a duplicate of that question).  I think the answer provided there will give you the guidance you need.  If not, please come back here and let us know why it will not work for you.


















I don't have a Touch Bar model, so using the menu bar as equivalent. 

Your question has a mismatch between the title and the concluding question. The title invites questions in "Linked" items which later lead to the target question. 

It should have been "How can I remove the Siri icon in the touch bar?" or similar. This would be similar to someone asking how to remove it from the menu bar. Which is different from disabling it completely. I use Siri, using hold cmd + space. But I have removed it from Menu bar. 

I am not a diamond moderator. I won't support merging them. One is very particular about activity monitor and disables Siri in a way that everyone doesn't necessarily want. That is my impression from your question. 

They can be linked in comments as a milder alternative, but moving Danill's answer there will at best invite downvotes. 

So I suggest you edit the question title and I will vote to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/reopen-questionsreopen.

I, ex user310476, would like to apologise for both the verbal and physical harm I did to the community.
Why I am apologising
I decided I can’t continue on this site in clean conscience the same way I used to before until I apologise to the community. I deleted myself from this site at the end of March 2019 and a few months ago added this site to the Your communities list with a purpose of visiting every once in a while.
Before I continue in editing, answering and engaging with users I need to come clean and deliver an apology both to the community and some specific people.
What I did
I did several things which I regret very much:

provided low quality contributions
had an agressive temper in chat
didn’t listen to advice from experienced users
didn’t listen to moderators
vandalised other users posts

Who am I apologising to?
I am apologising to the community in general for damaging it with my harmful activity.
I would like to specifically apologise to:

the moderators for my disruption but am thankful for their patience with me
nohillside and bmike for the way I dealt with them in particular
Allan for using bad tone when you were giving constructive criticism
The people’s posts whom I vandalised

In macOS 10.15 Catalina, a new dedicated Music.app replaced the venerable iTunes:


  What happened to iTunes?
  
  With macOS Catalina, your iTunes media library is now available in the Apple Music app, Apple TV app, Apple Books app, and Apple Podcasts app. And Finder is where you can manage and sync content on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
  
  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210200https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210200


In many ways Music is a re-skinned or renamed iTunes, rather than a true "new" app.



This seems to have lead to a number of "duplicate" questions being opened for the Music.app version of an existing iTunes question:

For example:


App opening when CD is inserted:


iTunes: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/205913/itunes-12-opens-automatically-when-cd-insertediTunes 12 opens automatically when CD inserted
Music: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/375764/how-to-stop-music-app-from-automatically-launching-when-cd-is-inserted-on-macosHow to stop Music app from automatically launching when CD is inserted on MacOS Catalina

Play/Pause buttons (SuperUser questions, but imagine them here)


iTunes: https://superuser.com/questions/1383264/prevent-itunes-opening-on-play-pause-button-in-macosPrevent iTunes opening on Play/Pause button in macOS
Music: https://superuser.com/questions/1503954/prevent-music-app-from-starting-on-f8-play-button-osx-10-15Prevent Music.app from starting on Play button





Are Apple Music questions duplicates of existing iTunes questions, if the interfaces and error messages and questions and answers are mostly the same?

Should the old iTunes questions be edited to modernize them for Music.app?

This may apply to questions about the other new iTunes-replacing apps such as Apple TV, Apple Books, and Apple Podcasts as well, but the iTunes and Music apps seem especially similar.

When proposing new tags, please also propose texts for the tag descriptions so the community can improve on those to have a common understanding.

Having said that: tags should be used to add value to a question by providing additional categorization/grouping. Any question about Procreate will already have the application name in the question somewhere, so also having a tag doesn't provide a lot of value. Also, we currently have exactly two questions mentioning Procreate, and the older one isn't actually about Procreate as such. So I doubt that there really is a need for a new tag on this currently.

Thanks all for advising, I was unsure how to proceed...


















Ok, just saying, but this site seems a bit broken.  The exact question I want to ask has been addressed, but I can't enter that conversation/thread because I don't have 50 reputation points.  So ... I am allowed to create a duplicate and redundant question, but not provide useful information to an existing thread???

Relative to the earlier thread ... I've tried every solution proposed there and none of them have worked.  Maybe since the last response in that thread someone has come across another approach?  Note that SOME of my icons (all .jpg) have thumbnails.

I recently posted a question:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/377573/user-reporting-that-push-notification-doesnt-always-show-in-the-notification-ceUser reporting that Push Notification doesn't always show in the notification center

It was closed with the following notice at the top:


  Closed. This question needs details or clarity. It is not currently accepting answers.
      Add details and clarify the problem you’re solving. This will help others answer the question. You can edit the question or post a new one.


I posted a new question, with more details and clarity.

It was also closed, with the statement from the moderator:


  Please don't repost questions. If your original question needs clarification, edit that question instead so it can be reviewed and reopened.


Yet the modal on the first question said to, "post a new one"

So, should a new question be posted or not, when you need to clarify further, and a question is closed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should I post, or not post a new question with clarifying information?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this to Meta, things are easier to discuss here.


















I agree that the messages you got are conflicting (and it probably doesn't help you if I admit that I was totally unaware of the fact that the close message recommends "edit existing or post a new question"). And as far as I know we don't have specific rules on whether to do one or the other. Nevertheless let me share my thoughts on this:


In general questions which are put on hold should be edited based on the feedback received in the comments. This allows everybody to chip in in order to improve the question and makes it easy to understand what's going on. It also makes sure that details which are only visible in the comments are not lost
Posting a new question might be an option if the original question already gathered a lot of downvotes (which usually are difficult to get rid of even if the edited question is well written) or if, based on the feedback received on the original question, the new question goes into a totally different direction (e.g. if the first question was a http://xyproblem.info/XY Problem and you now ask Y as a new question) or needs to be split into two individual questions

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, thank you, I will keep that in mind for the future.


















If a question is to be down voted or to be closed, does it make sense to require moderators to (perhaps walked through a process checklist):


migrate the question to an appropriate group OR
ask clarifying questions OR
provide constructive & specific advice for shaping questions OR
modify the question so as to improve the quality / viability?


We all have our biases and it seems a little too easy to shutdown questions: I have seen questions (from others) that were interesting that should not have been shut down.   I realize that some questions are so ill-posed & beyond salvage, at the same time there are others questions that are actually well-posed and closed.

I would like to see greater incentives for moderators to guide, if not modify questions to become useful to the community.

On the main site, you can find https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/378644/youtube-kids-is-cleaner-than-regular-youtube-but-i-havent-found-any-method-oa post I've written.  Let me first summarize it and analyze it, and then ask you about it.

Summary and initial analysis of my post on the main site

YouTube offers a little-known service called "YouTube Kids".  This service consists of a http://www.youtubekids.com/website, an iOS app, and an Android app.  The service is targeted to kids 12 and under.  It tries not to let them see inappropriate videos.  It doesn't always succeed, but it still does better than the regular YouTube app.

The problem:  On the website and in the Android app, I've found, autoplay is always on, and there's no way to disable it.  After one video ends, the next starts right away.  This is problematic, for https://offspring.lifehacker.com/turn-off-autoplay-on-your-kids-tv-shows-1822738108various reasons.

Really, I have two questions:


A)  In the iOS app, if there's any way to disable autoplay, how can I do so?
B)  On the website, and in the Android app, perhaps there's some way to disable autoplay which I somehow missed.  If so:  What is this method of disabling autoplay?


But, in practice, on the main site, I've folded both of my questions into one:


How can I disable the YouTube Kids autoplay feature, on iOS or on any other platform?


I've posed that one single question in my post on the main site.

More analysis

My post on the main site is really partially a cross-platform question.  It's asking:


A)  How can I do what I want on iOS?
B)  If I can't do what I want on iOS:  How can I do what I want on another platform?


I looked at https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp/on-topic. It looks like like question A is definitely on-topic. It's unclear to me whether question B is on-topic or not.

My two meta questions

Question 1.  Is question B also on-topic?

Question 2.  In the end, should my entire post on the main site remain open or closed?

Edit

Allan kindly heavily edited my original post.  I'm not sure that this meta question is still applicable.  If it's not, maybe we should close it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I posted a long question. Part of it is Apple-specific; part is not. Should it be kept open, or should it be closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this here! It’s way one the “too involved” side for my tastes but I need to give it some thought before suggesting some edits or how many posts might be needed to have ideal / single question. I really think there are two if not more on topic items so I’ll help as I can to get them sorted if the community can’t lend a quick answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan did all the heavy lifting on the question already, and added a good explanation here on the changes he made to it (and I fully agree with that). The whole thing is a good example for the edit process at works, which makes the meta question worthwhile to keep. Anybody interested in how shared editing can help to improve a question can have a look at the edit history to learn :-)


















Just throwing in my 2¢ so there can be a clear understanding of my reasoning for the initial close vote, the subsequent editing and the close retraction.

There was two main problems with the question: excessive narrative and too broad a scope such that the question wasn’t about Apple products per se, but rather a customer service issue seeing that YouTube has this issue across the board.  In other words, if YouTube failed to implement the feature everywhere, there’s nothing we can do and the issue belongs in YouTube’s court.

The goal of my edit was two fold:  narrow the scope to Apple products, in this case iOS and to reduce the narrative to an easier to digest question.  Short, to the point questions with focused, relevant details tend to attract more views and consequently, more answers.   Keeping the question focused on Apple and iOS is in keeping  with the norms of this site; relevancy to Apple And one topic per question.

It was a very substantive edit, so I sought permission prior to the edit.  The OP rolled back some of the changes, but kept it within scope.  Though the narrative and structure was a bit extensive for my tastes, I don’t like to tread on people’s style.  As such, I retracted my close vote:  it’s a good question and belongs on the site.

Should the original post be on this site?  No.  The it is too broad and outside the scope of this site

Should the edited post remain?  Absolutely.  Again, it’s a good question and is now narrow enough to be on topic.

Suggestion:  you could replace “iOS” with “Android” and re-ask in the Android site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for the suggestion!  I tried it on Android already.  It looks like there's probably no easy way to disable autoplay, on _any_ platform.  My next step might be to look into the best way to contact Google with a feature request (to add an autoplay toggle).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Allan - that question is struggling as you noted, let’s try has answer at least one portion of it before it gets more close votes.


















It's New Year's Day in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_TimeStack Exchange land...

A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:


  We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
  -- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation


While there certainly are https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/Moderators here, a significant amount of the moderation is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.

As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together. 
And what could be more festive than a big pile of numbers? 
So here is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on Ask Different over the past 12 months:

Footnotes

¹ "Community" here refers both to https://apple.stackexchange.com/usersthe membership of Ask Different without https://apple.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsdiamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1user #-1.

² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.

³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-userGenerally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.

⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.

⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes).

⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.

⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

Thank you @shog9 for your many years of service here. You were instrumental to me learning the ropes as I joined the sites and got adjusted to what it means to serve as one of the moderators here - first by reputation and then after election.


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/342031/thank-you-shog9Thank you, Shog9


Thanks specifically the kind words, encouragement, humor and humanity you brought to the concept of community and elected volunteer moderation here.

It will be sad to not have you pop in here every so ofter to drop a wisdom nugget or data about how the site works.

I just asked https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/380457/is-there-any-way-to-make-console-prompt-for-authentication-to-logs-the-user-isnthis question about viewing logs in Console.  These were the suggested tags:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/0or3m.png

These are mostly a fair guess based on the content of the question except for Lion.

iTunes is also not relevant but wasn't suggested in previous questions and  struck me that every single question I've ever asked (only 6  admittedly) prompted Lion as a tag.  

Is there some reason for this?  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the suggested tags fixation with macOS Lion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I’m removing the bug since this is how the code is supposed to work, but perhaps if my answer is wrong we can add bug back.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike - I'm happy to lose the "bug" tag.  It was curiosity really.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We also could agitate to merge the lion tag onto macos and burn it entirely. The fraction of questions where a lion tag would be needed and the macos one wouldn’t is slim to none at this point, but that would be a separate request here on meta entirely.


















The code to suggest a tag is an algorithm based on similar words in other questions. Since you can’t change what people asked and tagged in the past, the only thing you can do is select a better tag or change the words in your question to generate new “suggested tags”.

Long term, we can curate tags here which will affect the algorithm, but that takes weeks to effect large tags like lion.

If you need to know about the specifics of this code - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/askasking that on the main meta would be ideal since we share code with all other sites, but our specific tags and site are generated from our existing questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks - that makes sense and I wasn't suggesting a change.  I didn't notice before that "Lion" is the most popular macOS version tag at 3312 with "Yosemite" at next at 3229, "Mavericks" at 2802 etc.  Therefore (if I understand you correctly) if a question seems to be about macOS the algorithm will suggest "Lion" unless something overtakes it in popularity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, popular like cockroaches apparently @lx07

Use this footnote template (items in braces {} are optional):

So, adapting this for attributing to iFixit specifically:

This is your template so save this for future use.  Just change the author's name and source image URI as needed. 


Here's what the rendered output would look like (using values from the original question):

CC BY-NC-SA Quick Summary

Here's a quick summary of what v4.0 of the https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Detailed_attribution_comparison_chartCC license requires:


Creator name, if supplied
Copyright notice, if supplied; disclaimer of warranties, if supplied
Title, if supplied
Notice that refers to Public License
Notice that refers to disclaimer of warranties if supplied
URI or link to material if supplied
Indication you modified the material
Indicate material is available under Public License and include the link


The key to remember is that you only need to include what is available and what is reasonable to include.  For instance, you may have a set character limit making attribution almost impossible.

A General Template...

The real problem with attribution is sometimes there just isn't enough information to provide.  You may not even find ownership, title, copyright, etc. for the image your linking.  What you can do is simply attribute it from where you found it:

Again, a reasonable effort to attribute the work should be sufficient.

This restriction has a few exceptions: it doesn't apply


on Meta sites
when both questions are asked by the same user
for ♦ moderators


Therefore, using a custom moderator flag is a good option. Please specify clearly why you're using a moderator flag instead of a regular vote to  close; standard flags are always preferred and you risk getting a declined flag otherwise.

Given the relatively low occurrence of this situation, opening a Meta question (as you did) is also an option. Moderators are always notified when a new Meta question is posted, so we're likely to read it about as fast as a flag.

In some situations, one of the questions contains some information which might be helpful to the author of the other one (e.g. some things they have tried already). In that case, it's nice to leave a comment with a link to the 'better' question.

In general comments are considered to be temporary information which can (and sometimes will) get deleted once the objective/purposed of it is reached.
The purpose of comments as such is documented in the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commentHelp Center:

You should submit a comment if you want to:

Request clarification from the author;
Leave constructive criticism that guides the author in improving the post;
Add relevant but minor or transient information to a post (e.g. a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).


PS: I handled the flag you left on the post. If you don‘t consider an answer to be helpful, please downvote instead of flagging.

I got I did wrong, but still, I believe deleting a comment is not fair. you could write to me about my faults and reject my flag. how ever, thanks for your answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AmerllicA You did nothing wrong, both commenting and flagging are features to be used :-) But your comment was addressed to the author of the post who obviously did read it. There was no need to keep it around longer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, Do you delete all comments which are seen by the post author? I think you discriminate between formal users and moderator users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AmerllicA As I said both in the answer and in the comment: Comments which have served their purpose are candidates for deletion. In the specific case I deleted both your comment and the reply comment by the author because keeping them doesn't add value to the site any longer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AmerllicA And just for reference: in the last 30 days we deleted about 300 comments overall, some of them due to comment flags, most others because there were no longer required. There is no dedicated task to delete old comments though, so you will easily find a lot of comments which are outdated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your clarification.


















I am going to set aside all the specifics of the flag and who handled it other than I didn’t handle the flag on my answer. 


Answer: they explain how to solve a problem 
Comments: they seek to clarify the question 


In this case, i think your problem was clear and wanted to propose you getting your sound in a way that doesn’t violate the terms of the App Store license. 

I love technical discussions how to reverse engineer a program but don’t see it as a proper general answer so I wanted to propose another way for you to get your sound. 

How is that not an answer?

At Apple's own community support forums, people gain a lot of reputation by copy-pasting a "reset your NVRAM or PRAM" advice to seemingly random questions (there are no downvotes there, only a "Helpful" button). Sure, you never know if it helps, but sometimes you can see it's irrelevant, especially if there's a better, more focused answer.

I see some of it here too, just because this is one of the first guesses that people make in case of mysterious problems.

When it becomes clear it's irrelevant, what can we do with such answers? Is it OK to downvote them even if the author made an honest effort to help?

Should anything else be done?

  What to do with “reset your NVRAM” answers?


As a general rule, I don't cast a down vote unless the answer is really egregious:


the question/answer is just a word salad of bad or misleading information 
gives bad or harmful advice 
After spending an inordinate amount of time writing an answer only for the OP to tell you that the question you answered isn't what the OP meant (these are quite rare)


https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5gY5.jpg

As for "Reset Your SMC" or "Reset your NVRAM"  I will usually post a question regarding the reset in comments:


SMC - Can you please expand on what resetting the Power Control Module has to do with foo-bar topic?
NVRAM - What setting in NVRAM is applicable to this issue? Values in NVRAM set the pre-boot environment like startup partition.  What in this environment is related to Microsoft Word (or other application that's not working)


I will also add some facts (in no particular order):


It's NVRAM, not PRAM.  PRAM was for PowerPC Macs and NVRAM is for Intel
The https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/304679/119271SMC is the equivalent to the PMU in every other laptop.  How many times do you hear Dell or HP users saying "Reset the PMU!"?
Resetting the SMC and or NVRAM to solve your problems is Internet Folklore that somehow caught on because it's a simple procedure.

In fact, that might be practical, but often it is not really helpful, and very seldom it provides *any insight* into the problem to solve.The balance between throwaway pragmatism and learning experience leading to resolution is quite skewed. In an unfavourable way. And as a matter of principle, considering past practice here: why not close all those as *duplicates then?*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LangLangC What exactly would be the duplicate here? Most of the questions with a NVRAM/SMC answer are different :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some things are easy to do and cause no harm. Might as well give them a try.

I was sure I'd already reset the SMC before 1st boot after setting it up. Turns out I hadn't & that was all it needed, one more [more careful] attempt at resetting. Tadahh, boot time back to normal.

I suggest that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screenscreen (585 questions) is added as a synonym of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/displaydisplay (2855 questions). These are the excerpts:

display: Generally a visual screen used to display graphical or text output
screen: The (usually) LCD display integrated into portable computing products, or external monitor/television connection to same.

I think there is a difference between questions like *"How do I move the dock to the top of my screen"* and *"What cable do I use to connect an external xyz display"* but the two words are pretty much synonyms and the tag descriptions don't help differentiate so perhaps merge these and make a new tag `External display`?


















We have this tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/troubleshootingtroubleshooting (253 questions) that is of questionable utility. Should we keep it?


It is definitely a dependent tag. If you saw a post that had just this one tag, you would not have any indication from tags alone about what kind of problem it is.
It might be a meta tag that describes the asker more than the question itself. Troubleshooting is a valuable technique, but sometimes a problem can be diagnosed without troubleshooting if the observer has sufficient knowledge.
It may be overly broad. I can easily find hundreds of troubleshoting questions that don't have this tag yet. For example, almost every https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bootboot question is about troubleshooting. Surely we wouldn't want to add it?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we keep the [troubleshooting] tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting....the [tag:troubleshooting] tag suddenly has zero questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan I'm as surprised as anyone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did someone do a merge or something?


















No, let's not keep the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/troubleshootingtroubleshooting tag. We don't want meta tags and dependent tags to be part of our tag library.

There are around 10 questions with only two tags, and most of them have very obvious tags that could be added. But generally speaking, my proposal here is to delete the troubleshooting tag and not bring in anything to replace it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And pro tip: there's a SEDE query for [finding questions that have just a singleton tag](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/148977/search-for-singleton-tags-on-questions).


















If a question has already been asked on another site, and over there it already has a great answer, or a collection of answers, do we want to leave it open here?

This specific question is the one that got me wondering:

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/troubleshootingtroubleshooting is a valid tag and should be maintained.

Addressing the OP's concerns in order:


  It is definitely a dependent tag. If you saw a post that had just this one tag, you would not have any indication from tags alone about what kind of problem it is.


This is quite common with a countless number of tags.  Many times folks will ask a software or OS related question with a single take like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbook-promacbook-pro.  What we do in cases like this is


Ask for clarification
Edit the tags for relevancy



  It might be a meta tag that describes the asker more than the question itself.


Every tag in some way describes the asker in some way - what they want, what they need, and/or what they have.  


  Troubleshooting is a valuable technique, but sometimes a problem can be diagnosed without troubleshooting if the observer has sufficient knowledge.


Observation is a troubleshooting technique.  However, this isn't a one sided relationship on this site.  It's designed to teach folks how to do things, not just blindly answer questions.  I myself have answered questions asking how to troubleshoot problems:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/328979/how-to-determine-the-cause-of-macbook-battery-not-charging/328981#328981How to determine the cause of MacBook battery not charging?


  It may be overly broad. I can easily find hundreds of troubleshooting questions that don't have this tag yet. For example, almost every https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bootboot question is about troubleshooting.


Any tag by itself has the potential to be overly broad (i.e. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macmac)  This doesn't mean we should just up and remove it.  What we should do is what I referenced in the first answer:


Ask for clarification
Edit tags for relevancy

This may be way too trivial but I was wondering if it is possible to make the default answer (EG "Vote to close" etc.) accept the Enter key as well as a mouse click? That would make things so much nicer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Default answer will take [ENTER] rather than mouse clickb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This makes sense; Esc already closes the dialog. Note that if you *start* the dialog with keyboard shortcuts it will work (m -> c -> number -> another number if you need a suboption -> enter). Type a question mark to see which shortcuts are available.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry I don't understand, how do you *start* the dialog with the keyboard? I have to **click** on "close" or "flag" to get the dialog.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can just press 'm', this will select the post (it will get a gray background), and then press 'c'.

But it does not seem to work when reviewing questions and answers in the review queues, but I will hammer on it a bit more in case I am doing something wrong (HAH!)


















I propose that links to the very good canonical questions (as sourced from the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2419/18101wiki answer on this question) should be added to the relevant tag wikis.

For example, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/icloudicloud or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appleidappleid could include a link to this question:


https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/182966/forgotten-icloud-email-id-and-passwordForgotten iCloud email ID and password


I don't expect question askers to necessarily read each tag wiki and find their answers there. Rather, it would make it easier for people to search for duplicate questions and redirect askers to high-quality answers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks nic. I’ve made a new section for Apple accounts. I like your idea of linking here for this. Not sure we can link to a section of an answer using anchors perhaps?

My idea was to not actually rename the tag but make one to be the synonym of the other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside can we have the synonym setup please - we just had a tag edit adding find-my to something already having find-my-phone (which explicitly says it is for all find-my) https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/394679/revisions - also should find-my-mac be included


















I put together this mind map to represent approximate relationships I see between tags. Many tags do not fit well into a tree structure, so I've taken liberties in a few areas. Hopefully this is useful for writing tag wikis and excerpts, identifying areas of overlap, and for pruning the less useful tags on this site.

Navigating this map


Software that is mostly unique to Apple is all along the right-hand side, and divided into that which is applicable only to macOS, only to iOS, or is shared between iOS and macOS.
Along the left-hand side are the broader categories of hardware and software, with all tags for Apple hardware grouped together under the  symbol.
There's a wildcard * group for a lot of general terminology that isn't really specific to Apple hardware or software.
Although labels are arranged in branches, this was not an attempt to model a strict hierarchy. Many groups have been compressed into an elongated branch to shrink the map and help with readability.

I was just looking at my reputation and noticed I received a -10 recently for https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/242750/88313this answer.

When I look at the actual answer there's no downvotes.  I also looked at https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/242750/timeline?filter=WithVoteSummariesthe answer history and don't see anything that stands-out to indicate why such a big drop in points.

I thought it could be that a user, or users, who upvoted were removed and so the points I received from them were removed, too.  But 10 points seems like a really high number for this sort of situation.

I looked in the Help Center but couldn't find anything to lead me to an explanation for a large drop like this.  Can one of the Mods please let me know what happened here?

I have looked into this for you and it seems this is the result of someone reversing their upvote. See image below:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/APDqJ.png

So, because this was an unupvote as opposed to an actual downvote, it doesn't appear as a downvote on your answer.

Seems to be a case of a user having changed their mind for some reason some time after having originally upvoted your answer.

I’m a big fan of there’s no harm in a wrong answer or even a question that can be edited. If the question is something you didn’t realize, answering how you discovered the actual answer can be super helpful. 

Same with wrong answers, everyone can read things differently or not realize some key item and wrong answers actually tech and document that better than correct answers when both exist with good comments. 

Why not self answer and then if it’s getting bad votes, we can help edit and maybe correct things?

Deletion is good if there’s little chance you can salvage it. I would start with the best option. Make an answer and tick the check as answered and wait.

For anyone who is interested, we have set up an Ask Different team that is now folding for the Folding@home project.

For those not familiar with Folding@home, it's a distributed computing project for performing calculations for biomedical problems, such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, Ebola and now COVID-19. It works similar to how SETI@home works (in case you're familiar with that). In the case of Folding@home, it was initially started by Stanford University in 2000 and since 2019 has been run by Washington University.

For those of you unfamiliar with distributed computing projects, they use the idle processing power of people's computers to help process data as part of the overall research effort.

In fact, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Folding@home project has attracted so many volunteers that it is now offering a combined processing power that is greater than the fastest supercomputers. See this https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3a8ex3/foldingathome-harnessing-unprecedented-computing-power-fight-coronavirusarticle for one example of media coverage.

If you're already contributing to this effort, great! No need to do anything else, unless you're not part of a team and would like to join ours. If so, Ask Different team ID is 260066.

If you're not sure about this but would like to find out more, start by visiting the official https://foldingathome.orgFolding@home site, and/or have a look at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@homeWikipedia entry. You can also visit the https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/official FAQs page.

If you're not already contributing but would like to, continue reading.

Getting started

To get started, follow these steps:


Go to https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/Start folding webpage.
Click on the download link to download the software for your operating system. Access the https://foldingathome.org/alternative-downloads/Alternative Downloads webpage to get the installer for your specific operating system.

(Note: Due to it's nature, the Folding@home app is only made available for desktop operating systems and is can't be run on devices running mobile or tablet operating systems.)
Once downloaded, run the installer to install the software.
For those running macOS and preferring to install via https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-caskHomebrew Cask, run using the following command-line:

brew cask install folding-at-home
After installation, a web page may open. Ignore this and close the window/tab.
If you are using a Mac, go to Finder and open the /Applications → Folding@home folder, and launch the FAHControl.app. Or, alternatively you can search for FAHControl in Spotlight to launch the app.
Users of Windows and Linux computers can search for and launch the app from the appropriate applications menu/folder for their operating system.
You may be alerted to the fact there is no identity. You can:


Click the Fold Anonymously option if you'd like to remain anonymous, or 
Click the Configure Identity option if you'd like to use a name. This allows any points you have contributed to be credited to the name you're using. You can also join a team if you'd like by entering the Team ID number. (If you'd like to be part of our team, just enter our team ID: 260066).

Click Save.
The app is also made available as a standalone command-line client. You can use the following links to access the version corresponding to your operating system:


https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/installation-guides/linux/command-line-options/Linux
https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/installation-guides/mac/command-line-options/Mac
https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/installation-guides/windows/command-line-option/Windows





NOTES:


By default, the Folding@home project is currently prioritising COVID-19 data. However, if you'd like to dedicate your idle CPU power to another cause, then click the Configure button, select the  Advanced tab and select the cause from the drop-down menu - The 'any' option is currently prioritising COVID-19.
The main FAHControl screen allows you to manually set the amount of processing power you want to allocate (Light v Medium v Full). Feel free to change this as you see fit (e.g. you may want it on full if you're not using your computer for a while, or if you've got a powerful enough Mac to just leave it on Full all the time).
On MacBook models it will be normal to hear the fan running - if this concerns you, feel free to reduce the Folding Power (see bullet point above). Please allow a bit of time for the change to take effect.
It may take a little while after setup for the FAH client to download it's first piece of data for processing. Also, it is normal that there will be periods when the software isn't actually processing any data. This is because it needs to download the data, process it, upload the results, and start the process again - and sometimes there can be a delay depending on server demand etc.
Depending on your computer, and how much it's being used, processing each piece of data can take anywhere from hours to days, so do not be concerned if it seems slow to you.
You do not need to keep the FAHControl app open for your computer to keep folding. There is an FAHClient that will run in the background to keep things chugging along.
You can change your Identity or join a team at any time by clicking on the Configure button and selecting the Identity tab. To join the Ask Different team, just enter our Team ID: 260066. To join or change to another team, you can change the Team ID at any time.




Support

For support you can visit the https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/official FAQs page. There is also a https://foldingforum.org/index.phpFolding@home Support Forum. 

Also, while I am not in any way affiliated with Folding@home, if you do have any questions/concerns feel free to ping me (@Monomeeth) in the comments below and I'll try my best to assist.

A final word

We have set this up in the hope it may interest/attract new users to this effort, especialy in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Every bit of processing power is useful and appreciated, and it is in that spirit we are joining the effort. We are not doing this to try and be the 'best team'. In fact, there are over 249,000 teams, many of which have been around for years, so it would be a futile effort to try and reach the top of that list. But, it is our hope that this Meta post and the creation of our team may attract new users who previously have not heard of this effort.

Remember: Every little bit helps, so if you're interested, why not give it a go. Many of us also have an older computer laying around not doing much, and IMHO this is something well worth doing. :)

I have a question about my Ask Different post: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21641/can-i-set-custom-album-artwork-that-isnt-included-in-one-of-the-songs/388485#388485Can I set custom album artwork that isn't included in one of the songs?


My answer was deleted by a mod. I believe my answer is justified because:

1) While most of what I wrote can be called a comment, I also added my own improvements of one of the answers, and elaborated on what I thought the iTunes library mechanics was. This means that it's more than "just a comment" and has value as an answer.

2) In my post, I commented on and compared both existing answers, which makes it unsuitable as a comment under either answer.

3) I've never posted anything on Apple SE, and therefore, don't have enough reputation to post a comment. I've seen countless "can't comment because reputation not enough, so posting as an answer" posts across the whole SE network, one example of which is even from https://stackoverflow.com/a/59684501?noredirect=1my own question. Yet somehow my post on Apple SE isn't permitted. This double standard is ridiculous.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My answer was unfairly deletedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Firstly, welcome to Ask Different and thanks for asking on Meta. :) Probably best for me to let the Mod in question to respond. But, I did want to comment on your 3rd point: on here (as with most SE sites I've been on), the Mods will usually delete answers or convert them to comments if the user has obviously posted an answer instead of a comment due to their lack of reputation. So, on this point I don't see a double standard. I did look at your example question from SO, but in that case the 'answer' would be difficult to convert to comments and it also wasn't flagged for action by a Mod.


















:


   this may be a duplicate question.


:

there should be an off topic tag for questions that may be valuable to mac users, but aren't directly related to Apple


  an example may be something related to file types: "Why should I use this file type", or "my external display wont connect", or "google chrome wont open on any device". Something that could involve apple, but doesn't. 


etc..


  this may be a bad example, but it may be useful

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5add off topic tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is so meta, I kind of like it. It goes against what a tag should be, but it might be useful. What of people edit a closed question to add this and that burns the one edit review it gets? I think we need to get that changed so that when the OP edits the question, it asks if this edit is intended to trigger a review.


















Not sure I see a benefit here. If a question is off-topic we put it on hold to give the OP the opportunity to revise it, and close it if they don’t (or the scope of the question doesn’t allow it). So a question is either on-topic and properly tagged, or closed (and tags not really important any longer). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm in complete agreement with this; I can't see any benefit to having this tag.  If it's for statistical analysis, there's already mechanisms in place to to find questions that were closed/migrated/deleted for all the various reasons.


















The post https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/390158/why-are-thunderbolt-2-adapters-so-expensiveWhy are Thunderbolt 2 adapters so expensive was closed as not well-suited for this site because it is about hardware shopping and focused on price.

It is true that when the primary focus is about price, answers get out of date quickly, and a site like this is not well-suited to answer "what is the best external hard drive for less than $100" – such answers become obsolete almost instantly. This site does not do well answering questions that focus on the market price of things.

Questions about "what makes items in category X generally cost more than items in category Y" seem to be a fundamentally different thing. It's not asking about "Where can I find a cheap Thunderbolt 2 adapter," but asking what issues tend to contribute to higher prices for Thunderbolt 2 peripherals compared to Thunderbolt 3.

While it might be difficult to make this a directly actionable practical question, the answers are likely to lead to a deeper understanding of technologies and help people make long term decisions related to their adoption.

I therefore propose that while questions related to hardware shopping that focus on market price, which fluctuates rapidly, be closed as off-topic, but questions that focus on the factors related to the fundamental costs of an Apple-related technology (to be sure, one of the factors related to price, but far more persistent and likely to produce an answer of enduring quality that may be useful for years to come) be considered on-topic on this site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Difference between price and costb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am all for staying of that question. 

I feel it is similar to algorithm performance questions  on Code Review, or HDD vs SSD on Superuser. 

A question about the difference between USB-C and thunderbolt 3 was something I was looking for too.


















So I understand questions that invite purely speculative answers are not helpful here. But I have a real use case situation and the fact that the product I'm looking for doesn't seem to exist both frustrates and perplexes me, and I'd love some help forming the right question to ask on the main site.

Text editors that can edit, display, and reshape data, code, and more freeform text have been a staple of just about every computer operating system. iPhones have more processing power than most computers I've used in my life, and iPads are being marketed as replacements for notebook-form computers. And yet whenever I have any serious text to edit, whether Perl or JavaScript or a big CSV file encoding an exam I'm writing for a class I'm teaching, I find myself firing up my Mac to do the editing, because nothing in iOS seems to be able to do the job of BBEdit. But I don't understand why that is. It would seem that by now there would be a great text editor for iOS. The fact that one hasn't emerged seems to suggest that there is some barrier to its existence.

I wouldn't think "why doesn't product X exist" would be on-topic here; it seems like all the answers would be speculative. Is there a good way to ask that? The lack of a solid text editor for iOS is a real source of frustration to me, and I'd love to figure out if one doesn't exist simply because someone hasn't gotten around to making one yet, or if there is some hardware or OS limitation that prevents this operating system from yielding its native version of one of the fundamental computer tools that almost every other computer environment seems to have evolved.

Does anyone know how to ask this in a way that would produce high-quality answers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to ask a question about why a product doesn't existb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This OP did exactly that:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/267009/119271



















It seems to me like "Ask Different" is against these rules.

Its not for three reasons:

Apple doesn’t hold the trademark on the slogan/phrase “Ask Different.”  Their phrase, as you have noted is “Think Different.”

Apple only limits the use where disparaging

Disparaging Manner: You may not use an Apple trademark or any other Apple-owned graphic symbol, logo, or icon in a disparaging manner


Fair Use doctrine allows use of trademarked items (regardless of their T&Cs) to criticize, comment, or parody.  This site is filled with criticisms and comments about Apple Products.


If you want an excellent example of this, look at the “Hackintosh” community.  Per Apple’s own guidelines, you are prevented from using “Variations, takeoffs or abbrieviations of their name, products, slogans, etc”

Variations, Takeoffs or Abbreviations: You may not use an image of a real apple or other variation of the Apple logo for any purpose. Third parties cannot use a variation, phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation of an Apple trademark for any purpose. For example:
Not acceptable:   Appletree      Jackintosh      Apple Cart      iPodMart

If that were truly the case and enforceable, the Hackintosh community would have been gone a long, long, time ago.
Disclaimer:  I’m not a lawyer.  I don’t play one on TV or any streaming service.  Nothing here should be construed as legal advise.  It is only my opinion on this matter.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, good point. Having seen it in that way, it makes more sense. After reading your answer, I went back and read the original document and I noticed that it also says

"Web sites that serve only as noncommercial electronic informational forums concerning an Apple product or technology may use the appropriate Apple word mark, provided such use complies with the guidelines set forth in Section 3 above."

Which I would say this site definitely meets.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Excellent!  I didn't see that, but, from a free use standpoint, its like saying “you are allowed to do what is already legal.”b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I suppose they need not have really included that in the first place because it would already be allowed. Apple wouldn't be able to legally say that's not allowed anyways.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lawyers like to say things in a way that makes you think they’re being generous by giving you something you already had rights to.  +1 for the question!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the wording. **I am not a lawyer and I certainly am _not your lawyer_.**


















Similar to this https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2433/35933question I had the same issue in https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/390316/35933here, where the users go into discussing how to edit/use StackExchange. When flagging for chatty, they just got declined.

Example comments:



  that should be in the question - I didn't see it under the rolled up comments - and it completely changes the context of the OPs original post. Do you have edit privilege yet? If so, edit it and get the credit for the fix as well.


  @Allan Agreed. I am unable and unfamiliar with editing an original question. It should be suggested to OP, I assume. (And, I also don't like the rolling up of comments.) 



Got several flags rejected without reason, when the comments are clearly about using StackExchange, and also have the edits were done so reading those comments is just a waste of time.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are comment flags declined if comments are obsolete and the obsolete flag was used?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How did it workout for you @grg? Did you manage to improve a question by cleaning up obsolete comments or did you also find rejections blocking you?


















Comment flags can only be acted upon (resulting in the deletion of the comment) or declined, there is no option to provide feedback (which is actually optional also for flags on post).

I didn't handle the flags on these comments, but I would have declined them as well. The comments show good community actions on helping a new user to understand the site better and to collaboratively improve the quality of a post. So it is a good example for future visitors to better understand how the site works and how everybody can help to improve it.

PS: As a side remark: It's usually enough to flag one comment beneath a post. We usually look at the comment in context when handling the flag anyway.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The comments are still obsolete and confusing to people reading the Q&A since the edits have been done already. Isn't the point of comments to add value or information on the actual topic? Also, isn't cleaning up obsolete comments part of improving the site? Otherwise, what's the point of that flag? I see on your other answer that comments like the ones I flagged, you agreed on declining, so it's really confusing to what are the goals of good community actions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also I only flagged the related obsolete comments to make it easier to cleanup. Having all flags rejected looks more like the user didn't even want. to look at the context.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Efren "+1. Excellent answer!" comments are always candidates for deletion, they do not add any value to the vote given.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In StackOverflow, discussions in comments are also taken to the chat, rather than populating the Q&A with comments that are not related to the OP, is this not the intention in Apple.StackExchange?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5can you agree on what is for deletion and what is not? In this answer you say "I would have declined them as well", yet in the comment you say "candidates for deletion, they do not add any value to the vote given"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Efren Moving to chat is an option as well, and something we use sometimes. Handling of comments is different on the various SE sites. SO gets much more comments than we do, so I understand why they are more focused on deleting them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@efren The answer was referring to your comments on the answer on main, the remark in the comment was referring to "+1. Excellent answer!" comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still don't see what value they add to the OP, how about the other comments you agreed to delete in the other [question](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2434/35933) how do you determine then if value is added? - PS: if this site works different to SO, then you haven't answered "what's the point of that flag?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@efren The comments on https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/390316/35933 add value to the site as a whole.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@efren Also, if you think a *post* needs improving, editing it is usually the better approach than flagging.

Keep in mind, the system rolls up long comments automagically, so people don’t see all the comments - just the top ones.


















Just sharing a site I found that could potentially be useful, not just here on Ask Different, but pretty much anywhere if you need to assist someone troubleshooting a network issue and need to see the modem/router interface.

Right now the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicon-topic FAQ reads:


  Please refrain from asking about the following topics:
  
  Code-level programming questions (cocoa, LLVM, etc…) are off-topic here. We do encourage AppleScript, Automator, and UNIX shell scripting questions as well as how to use tools like Xcode for non-language specific tasks.


But today I noticed this question that is seemingly about hardware development; the asker expresses their desire to "build a device".

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/389433/18101Homekit: multi mode button in home app

Our FAQ doesn't call out hardware development as being off-topic. Should it? And do we care about whether development is for distribution or just for private use as hobbyists?

You can change the order of the answers yourself if required by selecting Active, Oldest, or Votes. This is a per-user choice.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIaVm.png

But in general there is no need to have the accepted answer also have the highest number of votes. "Accept" is just the way the OP uses to indicate which answer they liked best (so it's kind of like a super-vote). This may be different from what other users think (and vote).

In the specific case this is rather obvious: The OP is asking 


  I'm aware that multiple third-party websites exist that have this info, but is there an easy-to-find list of archived URLs for the spec pages for these older models that were previously contained on the Apple Support pages?


which actually only the accepted answer covers. But others consider the links to 3rd party information more helpful, so the voting differs.

Have you read the parts about promoting, editing and asking? I’d be happy to look at your question and see if any of the advice seems more useful for your specific instance.

We’ve not had a https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-keyboardmagic-keyboard tag on the main site until the iPad version of that gear was released recently. I created that tag, but wanted to see if there was consensus how to use the main https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard tag vs the iPad one.

I could see three scenarios:


send all usages to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard and maybe have synonyms, maybe just merge them down.
keep https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/keyboardkeyboard for the Magic Keyboard that is bluetooth and lightning/USB connected and keep https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-keyboardmagic-keyboard for the one that physically connects to iPad Pro with three electrical contacts and also has backlight and trackpad integrated in with the keyboard.
make specific tags like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-keyboard-bluetoothmagic-keyboard-bluetooth and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-keyboard-ipadmagic-keyboard-ipad or something so that we can hopefully manage when someone chooses the wrong tag and make tag wiki that provide guidance.


If you feel strongly about one of these options being best, please choose your warrior and write a small defense on why it’s right. If no one has any opinion, we can let things ride until there’s a need to act.

No matter what way we go - we should edit the wiki tag summary / usage appropriately once there is consensus on a direction to take.

This one confuses me.  I flagged this answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/392854/119271https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/392854/119271 - as not an answer, which was subsequently declined.

In the comments, the author literally says, in response to a comment about it not being an answer, “Yes, It does not. I just wanted to add more information in case someone can dive deeper....”

There was no answer in the answer, just observations, a “fun part“ which was more observations and a section called “wild hunches” guessing what the problem could be.

This has happened to me many times but I’ve never been fortunate enough to have the answer author provide agreement.  I’m just confused as to where the delineation is regarding what constitutes a bona fide answer or not.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Non-Answer Declined Flag, but Author agrees with me!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I have to agree with the moderators that this answer doesn't meet the bar for a flag, it's still a bad answer for this site and seems deserving of down-votes. But as of this writing, I appear to have cast the sole downvote, and there were two upvotes. Little surprised by that...


















Thank you for raising this question. I see many people not understanding the not an answer flag. You are not alone to be confused here. Have you read through this post and the answers?


https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1629/why-was-my-flag-for-not-an-answer-declinedWhy was my flag for "not an answer" declined?


What parts of the answer on why we decline not an answer flags in general might apply to the post you identified?

When I read the answer I see the following characteristics:


Excellent thinking and troubleshooting
Additional information on which macOS versions are affected
Process of working out issues that can be edited / improved
No harm whatsoever to it remaining visible


I'm tempted to +1 it since it's much more useful and moving the discussion forward as I see it - especially compared to the rest of the questions. 

The problem here is the question, not the answer IMO. I’ve protected that so it gets less me too, but I don’t see any need to single out any of the poor questions. Votes can handle bad answers / non answers there and no unilateral moderator action seems needed other than a protect. If you see bad questions like this a flag of other on the question - asking for it to be protected would be the best flag to cast.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I’ve read that before and the only thing I can see that could apply is the sentence about “moving the discussion forward.”  There’s literally no answer in there. However, that then conflicts with what I perceive the goal of this site to be - a question and answer site.  Is this the direction you’re pointing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @Allan for clarifying. I'll edit my answer -  I see the post you reference totally adding new information - I don't think adding any of the answer to the question would help. In fact, editing down the question would be my next recommendation - moving more of the troubleshooting to answers like this. Only when a fix or several fixes are isolated would we edit / remove the troubleshooting if it became a problem. I don't see any problem here where a moderator would unilaterally remove that post.


















The answer you flagged doesn't give a definitive answer to the question – in part because there are many possible causes for the problem. It does propose several possible answers and a path to try to get there.

With feedback from the Original Poster, this could be edited to be a definitive answer, but I would still encourage leaving the advice to check all the other factors proposed. Do you think the site would be better/more helpful if these steps were deleted, as you proposed by flagging the post? I certainly do not. Yes, we would love to have every question have a clearly correct, well-documented answer the definitively answers the question. If that existed and then someone was posting speculation like this, we might to well to clean it up (unless the speculation was actually a description of the process of diagnosing the problem). But in the absence of a single correct answer, the post you flagged is constructive.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are we talking about the same flagged answer?  I didn’t see any “steps to try” or “proposed solutions.”   That “answer” contained, as the author put it, “wild guesses” as to the cause.  I’m not flagging because it’s not correct but because it didn’t move an accepted **and** highly voted answer forward.  This was commentary, and this explanation feels like the definition of an “answer” is much more fluid than I thought.


















This may seem pedantic, but on a site like this, precision is important; so can I ask that we all watch out for the correct use of the words Depreciate, Deprecate, and Removed?

Depreciate means to reduce in value, and one may expect to see this word in answers about old Mac hardware. However, it's a one-letter slip away from 'Deprecate', and there are plenty of answers which speak of OS features being depreciated.

To make matters worse, answers often use 'deprecate' (spelt correctly or as 'depreciate') to mean a removed feature (e.g. "Rosetta was deprecated in OS X Lion."), when of course it means a feature that is still present but advised against.

For instance, 32-bit apps are deprecated in Mojave, and support for them is removed in Catalina. The retail value of 32-bit software may depreciate as a result.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Depreciated, Deprecated, and Removedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I support and endorse collaborating on style guides and definitions that are precise. This is the content I’m here for - being precise, correct and deliberate about use of technology and how we document knowledge. Thank you for launching the discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thumbs up for one of my favourite OCD eye-twitchers; along with appraise/apprise and apostrophe's in plural's. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tetsujin if having to read it bothers you, try *hearing* someone say "depreciate" when they mean "deprecate". The cringe factor is hard to describe.


















Well, we have users from all over the world for which English is the second or even third language they learned. Expecting proper use of words in all cases is probably asking a lot. 

This doesn’t mean that proper use isn‘t important, it even helps everybody interested in improving their vocabulary. So if you see posts which would be more understandable with proper terminology please go and fix them. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think anyone is suggesting that users be burned at the stake for using the wrong word—merely raising awareness and encouraging edits when something is wrong.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On the other hand, most of those words are only used because they were seen in log messages, articles or support documents, and anyone who is unsure of what to use can always fall back to copying and pasting the correct words straight from the source, just like one would do when quoting said source


















By all means, change the word choice and let the moderation queue judge. Personally I would hesitate before bulk replacing deprecated with removed.

I agree that depreciate is likely to be mistakenly used instead of deprecate. The former is more frequently used in English language and may be being suggested by auto-correction tools.

Apple's use of "deprecated"

Note that https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1537133-cfbundleclosebundleresourcemap?language=objcApple https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsfilemanager?language=objc#topicswidely use deprecated for API calls and features that are likely to be removed (or hidden) in future releases of their products. I wonder if this is why it appears frequently on this site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, but "likely to be removed in the future" and "actually absent right now" are two clearly different things. Many things in MacOS are deprecated, but continue to work until some point int the future. The distinction should be preserved.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Given Apple often **deprecate** something before **removing** it in a later version, should answers be updated to reflect the version they refer to or edited to reflect the latest version?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ideally, an answer should read "This feature was deprecated in OS X Lion", and then be edited to include "and removed in 10.16 Vasquez Rocks". That way, anyone using an older OS will know exactly where they stand.


















There's often an Apple Support/Knowledge base document that discusses a particular feature or answer to a common user query. I and many other users  reference the link to the document in our answers.

I am wondering if it's a good practise to include the link as it is or should the title be provided as part of the link? For example, the Apple Support document discussing the Sidecar feature present in macOS Catalina and iPadOS 13 can linked to like this:


https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210380https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210380


or like this:


https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210380Use your iPad as a second display for your Mac with Sidecar


I have taken the latter approach for a long time as I think it's descriptive to include the title to the document. However, I have often noticed many experienced users taking the former approach of not including the document title as a part of the link.

I wonder if those users are not including the title as the title may be liable to change?

I am trying to compare between the two and follow a consistent approach moving forward.

Further complicating things is that while depreciate means to decrease in value and deprecate means to declare something obsolete and to be avoided, either depreciate or deprecate can be used to mean "to disparage or belittle" – I am happy to deprecate or depreciate the myriad faults of Catalina and encourage people to use Mojave instead (or better still, Snow Leopard, but alas…)

Deprecated and removed are decidedly different, though, and must not be mixed up.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, but users here are unlikely to report that Apple has belittled the APIs in CoreGraphics.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"I am happy to deprecate or depreciate the myriad faults of Catalina and encourage people to use Mojave instead" A fellow Catalina hater? :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The computer I have in service that crashes the least is a G4 eMac running Snow Leopard. I certainly have newer versions of the OS running on faster hardware, but when I need steady and reliable, I boot up my sixteen-year-old eMac.


















Just to show that this has a real-world impact: I've lost track of the number of blog posts, reddit comments, etc I've seen claiming that OpenGL no longer works as of macOS Mojave!

Since OpenGL was indeed deprecated in macOS Mojave, the source of this misunderstanding is relatively obvious.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 I wish I'd known that before carrying on with this game, totally oblivious that it should no longer work; like a bumble bee who hasn't read why he shouldn't be able to fly ;-))


















I am a heavy proponent of not hiding the link so I author my articles always to show the URL and KB and will append a quick summary or copy the title based on how pretty I feel that link should be. 

I will almost never do the second where the KB is invisible when reading. The “descriptive” I prioritize is knowing the Apple link / KB and not the narrative since I expect to explain in context why I feel the article is meaningful.

But, this is my preference and experience. I get others might have different priority or aesthetics.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you very much. I think I have arrived at about the same reasoning as you have shared above after spending the time on the site. I was looking to validate my reasoning by seeking opinions from more experienced peers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NimeshNeema Also - the wonderful thing is there’s always an exception to the rule - some times I will prefer what I state here isn’t the general case. Good thing we can edit and fix if we decide later a different choice is beneficial.


















I do tend to hide the link behind the page title, but I preface it thus

Apple KB - https://support.apple.com/HT210380Use your iPad as a second display for your Mac with Sidecar  

One thing I also do - this has been tested over time - is remove the 'location code' entirely, so rather than
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380
or even
https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210380https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210380
I will reduce it to
https://support.apple.com/HT210380https://support.apple.com/HT210380

as this seems to cause fewer issues on international pages.

I imagine doing this from a phone is considerably more troublesome.

After comments
I agree with both bmike & Allan's answers too, essentially that form follows function.
For instance, 


  You need to modulate your flanging sprocket using a dilithium crystal meta-damper - see https://support.apple.com/HT210380https://support.apple.com/HT210380 for more info on calibrating your sprocket.


rather than


  You need to do this first - https://support.apple.com/HT210380https://support.apple.com/HT210380


or even 


  You need to do this - Apple KB - https://support.apple.com/HT210380Calibrating your Flanging Sprocket - then you can dampen your crystals.


which is less than useless.
So, the first is explanation plus more detail on one more difficult aspect, second is just an irritating link-only, third only covers half an answer & forces the reader to click through to even get that half.

I guess it's not a hard & fast rule, it's 'what fits the content'.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Definatley @Tetsujin - the right tool for the job!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I used to prettify links to until recently. But I realized there may be a possibility the title may change. I like how a link to a question from Ask Different gets prettified "automatically" and picks up the current title. I wish it could be done for any link on the web.


















I would suspect that the vast majority of “depreciate” being used in place of “deprecate” are innocent typos. On more than a few occasions, I had to correct my phone’s autocorrect selection with that specific word choice.  So, a simple fix via edit should suffiice.

However, regarding the word “removed,”  this should be done with a some due diligence.  I recently rolled back an edit where my chosen word of “deprecated” was replaced with “abandoned” changing the intent of the sentence not to mention being factually incorrect.  The technology was made obsolete, it was never abandoned.

Another example would be AFP because at first glance it seems as if it could straddles both definitions, but it doesn’t.  Here’s why:


AFP is deprecated in Catalina as a client.  You can still connect to AFP share from Catalina though the preferred method is SMB2 (and SMB1 is deprecated in favor of SMB2)
AFP is not supported in Catalina as a file share - you cannot share from Catalina to another client.  


It’s important to note that AFP was never removed as a file share in Catalina (APFS) as it wasn’t supported in the first place - you can’t remove something that wasn’t there to begin with.

Additionally, I agree wholeheartedly with accurate descriptors.  For instance, going back to the word “abandoned,” it carriers a connotation that someone just “up and left something with no warning.”  Technologies that come to a natural conclusion in their lifespan are not abandoned, they’re End-of-Lifed or EoL’d.  An example of this would be Firewire.  It naturally came to and end of it’s life because it was superseded by USB.  Thunderbolt 1 and 2, likewise,  were not abandoned, they were deprecated because they were superseded by Thunderbolt 3; deprecated because they’re still supported
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"deprecated because they’re still supported" - Shouldn't deprecated mean that it's not supported anymore? TB2 may be obsolete compared to TB3, but I don't understand how it's deprecatedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dev - I actually wrote an answer, that in part addressed this very topic.  See:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/285419/119271b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're right that describing hardware requires more care, certainly, because whether Apple still builds the hardware into Macs is one thing; and whether the OS supports that hardware, if found, is another. Apple has abandoned the inclusion of FireWire ports in new Macs, it could be said. EoL is perhaps the more technical, if clumsy, descriptor.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@benwiggy you keep using the term “abandoned” which is altogether incorrect.  The very first [definition for abandon](https://binged.it/3fqG3gL) “cease to support.”  Using the Firewire example, Apple has *not* ceased to support it as Catalina still has support for it, I can also *currently*  buy “official” Thunderbolt to Firewire adapters.  Not including the device is not abandoning because if it were, Apple would have abandoned SD cards, USB-A, and HDMI.  EoL is highly accurate and nothing “clumsy” about a well established industry term.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough. (Though the second definition is 'given up': Apple has given up adding FireWire ports to Macs.) For non-technical questioners, there ought to be another English verb that fits the definition. A three-word adjectival phrase turned into a verb is linguistically clumsy, arguably.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The term is “no longer” or “ceased.”  “Given up” means “surrender” and Apple has not surrendered putting ports on a MacBook; they are *no longer* or *have ceased* including FireWire ports on the MacBook.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So I've surrendered to smoking by not doing it anymore? But yes, those are better alternatives.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Definition of surrender](https://www.bing.com/search?q=surrender&pc=MOZW&form=MOZWSB).  Look at first bullet under #1 definition.  Microsoft *abandoned* the Windows Phone because they *gave up* or *surrendered* to iPhone and Android.  MS even gave a date when they would stop support.  Apple didn’t *abandon* Firewire when they stopped including the ports because it is still supported today.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It’s important to note that these aren’t *my* definitions per my opinion; these are **industry accepted terms**. Before becoming a network admin and subsequently moving into IT management, I was a product manager for a hardware manufacturer and consequently I still have connections to that life via publications, colleagues and friends.  If English isn’t your first language, it’s ok, we’re more than happy to help with the nuances.  But there isn’t a debate as to the terminology or phraseology used; you’re just using the terms incorrectly.


















For me, the 'authority' of the link is important, and I'm more likely to accept information from a support.apple URL than 'hot.osx.skillz.biz'.

While that info can be gleaned from a mouse-over, having it visible, in some format, is my preference.

Ask Different Style Guide
I've been going through the Suggested Edits review queue and of late, there's been some wild "swings" in terms of the formatting (i.e. code, menu, keyboard, etc.), technical terminology, capitalization, etc.  leading to very inconstant usage of formatting conventions.
I was thinking that we could come up with an "Ask Different Style Guide" of which we could refer to for consistency in posts and in edits.  It could be based off of https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/?sub=apde23dc814bApple's own official style guide but be very much simplified as we don't need anything that formal or complex.    The ultimate goal would to follow Apple's lead and strive toward some consistency in phraseology.  Think of it as Ask Different's version of "https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19796-01/819-2661/6n4uetjqo/index.htmlConventions Used in this Manual"
For example, we have code formatting for, well identifying code or text commands.  It's been used for everything from identifying keystrokes instead of using Key formatting, highlighting menu selections, notating operating system versions, identifying web site addresses to separating sections in an answer rather than using headers.  Obviously, this can be confusing, but if I you have even the slightest bit of OCD, it can lead to a stroke.
My idea is to "level up" Ask Different and make us stand out.  We have some fantastic minds on here and it would simply be awesome if Internet searches brought people to the official unofficial question/answer site for everything Apple.
Getting started
I'm thinking that we could each contribute via an "answer" and format it with two sections:

Issue
Proposed styling

As for compiling and creating the final guide, I'm more than happy to contribute (but I wouldn't be too bashful to turn down any assistance. I'd really like this to be a community effort.  I'm open to any format or methodology.  Comments, questions...let me know!

And I am very much in agreement re: misuse of code ticks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You may also explain how this should relate to the document https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editing and the resulting impetus on 'when & what to edit' (ie ~ make it substantial; try to fix everything you see…)


















https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/394841/replace-macbook-pro-13-early-2015-screen-with-mid-2014-screenThis question was just closed as "off-topic."
It seems to be on-topic to me, as it concerns only Apple hardware and whether the screen from one Mac might be useable on another model. I agree it's incomplete and requires more info to become answerable, but don't understand the "off-topic" closure reason.
Why was this question viewed as off-topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was this question closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We have not revised our close notices since the new change. In the past we had a “basic troubleshooting” close reason that was not as useful as the current one. All of our custom close reasons probably need refining TBH. Super glad you pointed this out.


















Very good question - the hiding of custom close reason seems like either a decision that should be reviewed or we should agitate for changing the threshold - I can see no reason why we shouldn’t let a user like you see precisely why the vote to close was cast.

Since they are not widely visible, first the reasons chosen seem appropriate to me, so I won’t be casting a binding vote to reopen.

Questions must demonstrate a reasonable amount of research & understanding of the problem being solved. Please edit to either a) clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it or b) include attempted solutions plus why they didn't work. In either case, be sure your expected results are clearly presented.

It doesn’t seem to be general enough to reopen without edits to clarify, but I also wouldn’t override the consensus if high rep users vote to reopen. It’s not horrible, but it’s certainly not a good hardware recommendation / repair question in the first version of that post. Edits could easily clean it up so it would be premature to delete it IMO.
We also close off site resource request questions so if this gets edited in to “help me source parts for this operation” it would likely be closed if it didn’t meet site quality standards.
Both of these close reasons are tailored to this site, so I appreciate very much asking on how / when to use them. If there’s a lot of confusion, we could flesh out meta questions to explain when these are used well and when these had to be reversed, but generally, I haven’t seen many problems with this close reason in the last 24 months here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't help that "off-topic" is the only close reason which allows site-specific details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And it IMHO also doesn't help that low-rep users can't see the detailed reason behind a hold. Makes it unnecessarily hard for them to help in improving a question, and to learn about on/off topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes @nohillside I have not looked at the new functionality where we can give some wording to the OP - other different wording to the high rep users, etc... I’ve added a preamble - we might need to get some more consensus and rejuggle the close reasons if there’s more than a few instances where it’s not helping as much as we hope or think close notices can. Too little data for me to have an opinion yet, overall or specifically, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This won‘t help with the lowrep users thoughb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the response. I agree that in its present form, the question is unanswerable. OTOH, it might be made answerable fairly easily, and I'd support a revision to the "closed" message to more completely present that the OP should both a) state what research has been done, and b) provide more technical/operational details of the setup and situation sought to be remedied.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Cool - hopefully people know they can edit closed questions since there is an Edit control visible. Food for thought on if we can get a change here or need the entire code base to improve or wait for people to read the friendly manual...


















Yet another, "why was this question closed?" post. Sorry, but I genuinely don't understand this one.
I put posted a https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/05/22/encyclopedia-stack-exchange/Q&A Format question (ie. I answered it myself to share research and knowledge):
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/394994/what-are-the-major-differences-between-apple-watch-versionsWhat are the major differences between Apple Watch versions?
It was closed for being "Off Topic", and yet less inclusive questions along the same lines are accepted elsewhere on the site:

And they're just three questions to do with the Apple Watch. There are countless other accepted questions asking for feature comparisons between iPhones, iPads, and other Apple hardware.
I feel a question that helps people quickly see the major differences between Apple Watches is useful to users and completely on-topic for this SE. Why am I wrong?

Edit: Just to broaden this outside of Apple Watches. The site is filled with accepted questions asking for tech comparisons. For example, iPhones:

I'm not sure why having so many disparate and separate questions is preferable, when some of these could be collated into a more generalised "https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/05/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/canonical wiki"?

I think there’s a lot of clarity that can be added. I will close one of the open questions since I think it fails the practical test that was used to close yours. With an edit and of these could be closed or opened IMO so there’s clearly some interpretation / grey areas here. With consensus I’m hope  we can come up to an agreement for many if not all concerned.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike It's an interesting discussion. Thanksb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do very much appreciate you clearly and respectfully asking for clarifications. Community FTW! I think we’ll want to close / edit some questions and all have a chance to clarify what’s on scope and what’s out. We surely can reverse closes on all of these. Your curation of excellent practical long tail comparison questions is helpful.


















This site focusses on finding solutions to practical problems. The three existing questions, while being broad, all ask a specific question about differences between models.
OTOH your question is rather broad and basically asks for a general overview of the differences between the currently known models. This wasn't work very well in a Q&A setup (are you going to extend the answer for future models), it also kind of replicates information easily accessible on https://everymac.com/systems/apple/apple-watch/index-apple-watch-specs.htmlhttps://everymac.com/systems/apple/apple-watch/index-apple-watch-specs.html. And, unless I miss some important detail here, it also doesn't really solve a practical problem as such.

Adding a new question every time a new product is released seems unintuitive. SE sites allow anyone to edit an answer in order to keep it up-to-date.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It also seems to go against the aim of SE sites becoming a wiki of canonical questions, as described here: https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/05/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you @DjangoReinhardt I’ve closed the other question. That seems more shopping than focused on specific differences in specific models. Like any off site resource questions, documenting the research and explaining how that research doesn’t answer your question is the ideal question in this space.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Despite what nohillside suggests, finding the information outlined in the answer was actually very difficult to come across and required watching keynote speeches and reading old reviews from the time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Specifically, we love long tail since that means the question is narrow. I think Joel is saying wiki means anyone can edit, not that our scope is for Wikipedia list of X articles that have naswers perpetually needing changes each release.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike That is a strange interpretation of what seems like an extremely clearly written article? :-/ He specifically talks about editing questions to make them "generic versions of the same question". His version of "long-tail" means "questions that aren’t quite important enough to deserve a page on Wikipedia, but which come up over and over again". The idea is to make a searchable resource of questions that are useful for *decades*, thanks to community editing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I’ll just say - we exist because SO and Super User rules didn’t fit for all sites. Literally if Super User and Stack Overflow would accept questions we did - there would be no need for our site. I’m not so sure the genesis or ongoing operations of Stack Overflow fits our model here as tightly as I think you are advocating. @DjangoReinhardt They close questions as off topic that we love. We close questions as off topic that they love. That’s a benefit to me, not something to erase or fix.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Hmm. Surely SO is for programming questions. Ask Different is essentially SU but for Apple products only.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree entirely - we are not SU with `s/PC/Mac/g` type change in scope. But I so appreciate you explaining your context. I’ll do all I can to be sure I understand your reasoning here - I may learn something in this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike SuperUser lists the following as being "on topic": "computer hardware, computer software, or personal and home computer networking". AskDifferent lists: "Apple hardware, Apple software, Apple services,
third-party hardware". Seems very similar to me? ;)


















I think Stack Exchange Q and A sites in general and Ask Different in particular is generally a bad place for “list all X” questions. Here the question seems to be, let’s crowd source extracting some undefined list of major features from all watches.

What practical problem is solved here?
Wikipedia does lists better than we do.
Blogs do better jobs of this than we do.

On occasion these work well initially, are fun, but the lasting value of curating these makes them poor. Here are two notable lists of things that had very short lives of usefulness IMO. (And you can blame me for both)

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23577/how-many-genius-mixes-are-there-in-itunesHow Many Genius Mixes Are There in iTunes?

I asked this initially when there was zero documentation. Apple didn’t release any info, this list was clearly manually curated initially, now it’s a bad question. Does it serve any real purpose long term? I wouldn’t reverse or object to votes to close it or votes to reopen it. It just is for now.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17759/what-tiny-thing-in-lion-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guardWhat tiny thing in Lion makes you smile or has caught you off guard?

This might be the most notorious / famous list questions. When I asked it, it was hard to find details and it was focused on sharing things that people learned. It generated a ton of involvement, but in the end - is it practical? I’m not so sure. If it were closed, would we lose anything, I don’t think much if anything.
Back to your Watch question - I understand Apple doesn’t present good summary tables comparing all the hardware, so I would propose we let the community cast reopen votes if needed on your post. I think it’s clear what ground you’re trying to cover as major since you put up a nice answer (thank you). Are you expecting new answers to be added? The close doesn’t prevent anyone from editing the post that is up and visible.
For me personally, I don’t see a reason to override the votes or cast a re-open vote. Let’s see in a week or two how it plays out based on how many edits are needed or if there’s a clear need to get new answers to the post.

Now, the important part is why are some questions poor? I see the ultimate goal here to be to host great answers. If you look at any question in this discussion - ask yourself - does this question make it likely that the answer will be correct and easily answered? Will it still be correct in 6 months or 6 years? That’s the goal of long tail relevance to me when I’m deciding to vote or close or reopen or edit a question. The other goal is anyone can edit and that’s possible on closed questions - editing and voting is allowed - even on hard deleted questions, high rep users can see and edit and vote on them. The questions here are soft closed.

One red flag in my mind is posts in need of a constant gardener to weed out bad answers and infrequently / regularly spend effort to bump and update an answer.  As soon as Apple releases new watches, new OS, withdraws old watches - your answer is now wrong or incomplete.

This class of answer is irritating at best, harmful at worst. There’s no way to unify something that changes as fast as hardware on a yearly release cycle from Apple. To counteract this, we are getting more specific about scope of questions.
I’m all for canonical questions on how to figure out the correct answer, but canonical questions that just adapt Or document current state of changing hardware seem less useful to me. I’d much rather someone ask - How can I tell which heart rate monitor is on my watch since I can’t figure out to buy Watch 5 and Watch 4? That is searchable and relevant - even when we are on watch 10 in the year 2025 (or whenever). Expecting someone to find a question titled What are the major  differences in Apple Watch versions?  and know if it’s software versions, hardware versions, or if major means the pixels on the screen or if it runs without an iPhone seems less searchable to be in general.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Again, I'll just repeat that this seems to directly contravene some of the primary purposes of SE sites: https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/05/22/encyclopedia-stack-exchange/ And: https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/05/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/ 

The problem with this question is that is apparently "too generic"? And if there were 22 different questions asking the difference between Apple Watch S1 and S2, and S2 and S3, etc, etc. That would be fine? 

SE sites always encourage generic versions of the same question in order to make them more widely useful. *shrug*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree that an article written in 2011 about Stack Overflow goals changes our purpose of hosting practical questions about Apple products and Services. What in _our_ help shows that the question should be reopened @DjangoReinhardt - I think that would be the fastest way to gain consensus on a reopen vote. As it stands, anyone can vote now to reopen that question and if it gets an edit, it will be entered in the automatic review queue. Those articles say “ask your question” and not “it won’t get closed if it needs refinement”b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the other point I'm trying to make is that asking https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27840/what-are-the-physical-differences-between-an-iphone-4s-and-an-iphone-4 is OK? But asking for a "canonical wiki" (use Joel's phrase) that is more generic to prevent every variation of that question is not? That's what is centrally confusing to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DjangoReinhardt The blog posts you cite come from a time where SE was focusing on programming questions. Such questions have answers which remain valid and relevant for a long time, and can get improved over time by adding more details, generalizing solutions etc. The same doesn't work so well for non-programming questions, so the information in those posts probably should be taken with a grain of salt.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DjangoReinhardt The question about iPhone 4/4s differences has a very specific and narrow scope ("reuse a precision case or protective film are going to find differences. I'm looking for first hand knowledge or reports of people taking a micrometer to the shipping hardware and doing a comparison.") which makes it a question about a practical problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Joel's posts are very much not related to programming. They talk very generically about the problems of sharing information in general, and the problems around sharing knowledge. His primary goal was to make people aware that SE sites are "not just a Q&A platform" (to use his words).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DjangoReinhardt Might be relevant that the title of the key post is "The Wikipedia of Long Tail Programming Questions", I might also argue that things have changed in the past eight years and that we learned that topics requiring ongoing maintenance/updates don't work so well over time (there are too many readers and not enough writers/updaters somehow).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside One of his posts has the title, "Encyclopedia Stack Exchange" and is just as relevant to the point I'm making. That post even links to the "The Wikipedia of Long Tail Programming Questions" to backup the point it's making in relation to Stack Exchange sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I interpret long tail to mean that obscure - well documented, very narrowly scoped questions that meet all the site guidelines is the goal. Not that we become Wikipedia with lists and articles and blog posts. We want to be the place to find good answers - all the rest is secondary. Critically any question in this thread is poor if the answer is good and correct. Both my linked questions above are not good examples of finding one answer to the problem asked. Lion is not relevant now and the mix question needs a gardener to constantly tend it. Wrong outdated answers stink, tbh.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I would say that there is the same amount of work involved in answering a new question as there is tending an old oneb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It look like the question has been answered by 2 mods and now it's just arguing via comments.  It might be more helpful if this discussion moves to chat.


















One of the primary goals of the SE platform was for it to become a searchable hub for maintained canonical information. What does this mean? In https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/05/22/encyclopedia-stack-exchange/a post published several years after StackExchange launched, one of its co-founders, Joel Spolsky set out the group's shared vision:

It’s not just a Q&A platform: it’s also a place where you can publish things that you’ve learned: recipes, FAQs, HOWTOs, walkthroughs, and even bits of product documentation

The aim was to solve was the problems faced by other Q&A platforms. Joel uses Usenet as an example: People joined the group and asked the same questions over and over, which resulted in frustrated readers and admin. Usually it led to moderators manually creating FAQs to repeatedly direct new users to.
With StackExchange, the idea was to avoid that ever happening, and with the learning from StackOverflow, they started encouraging users to "https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/07/01/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/answer their own questions", to "https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/01/05/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/edit questions to make them more widely applicable", and help make SE sites "https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/05/22/encyclopedia-stack-exchange/encyclopaedias of useful information".
Essentially the goal of a SE site is to "build up a library of canonical questions and answers that are more generic versions of the same question" (to quote Joel), thus allowing the closing of duplicates.
In short: If similar questions can be turned into a more generic and inclusive versions, then they should be.
In other words, it should be less "What Marvel film should I watch after Iron Man?" and more "https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/4649/is-there-an-official-marvel-cinematic-universe-viewing-orderWhat is the Marvel Cinematic Universe viewing Order?"
And contrary to bmike's answer, I find that "What are the differences between Apple Watches?" to be eminently searchable.

Hm! If I could make one broad criticism of where this fails in practice, it's that questions often *aren't* edited to make them more generic—the newer questions get marked as dupes, and made to point to the originals, which are still quite specific and often not quite the same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, as a user, it's not clear how the "original" question relates to the closed question that was more directly applicable to my situation. I should note though that Ask Different does a *much* better job of this than some other SE sites (thinking of Stack Overflow in particular)—although, as a trade-off, we're perhaps a bit messier as a result.


















At WWDC 2020, Apple updated their Developer Forums.
This has broken links to the old developer forum such as https://developer.apple.com/forums/message/335101https://developer.apple.com/forums/message/335101:

My original question though was more for what **I** can do when I find a broken link and want to locate it on the new forum. And to make sure that answer shows up on Google. Should we answer that here or re-open on Ask Different?


















Thanks for you concern! The example you reference is a relatively new scheme; there are https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=url%3Adeveloper.apple.com%2Fforumsonly two hits, both on your question today. Stack Overflow has https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=url%3Adeveloper.apple.com%2Fforumsnine hits, and I've checked a few and they all work.
However, the old scheme (e.g. https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/143196https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/143196) has a lot more hits; https://stackexchange.com/search?q=url%3A%22forums.developer.apple.com%2Fmessage%22over 450 across the network, https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=url%3A%22forums.developer.apple.com%2Fmessage%229 of them on Ask Different. A related search gives https://stackexchange.com/search?q=%22forums.developer.apple.com%2Fmessage%22224 hits (https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22forums.developer.apple.com%2Fmessage%226 here) but some of them might be duplicate. And not all those links are broken, e.g. https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/11908https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/11908 still works.
I do have https://german.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1506/15821some experience with mass-fixing broken links on Stack Exchange sites; I'll have a look what I can do. The main problem is that I can't fix them all at once without flooding the front page with old posts. There, I opted for a strategy of three posts per day. That might work here too.

Update: the first attempt at fixing them automatically isn't such a great success. Most of the times, the Wayback Machine didn't archive the link; when it does, e.g. http://web.archive.org/web/20161005194839/https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/8028this one, you can find the thread by looking for the 'canonical' link:
<link rel="canonical" href="/web/20161005194839/https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/4276">

and use that link, https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/4276https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/4276, to get redirected to the current one: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/4276https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/4276. My script fixed four of these cases on Ask Different (e.g. https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/238940/121968this one). For five more I was able to figure out from the context which message/thread it referred to, but there's no way to automate that (at least not for me). On Stack Overflow, it fixed 15 posts automatically. Next step is perhaps to collect all broken links, check which ones are often used and try to find the matching new link by hand.

How do we file the complaint?
The post is https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/395254/shouldnt-ios-disallow-apps-to-look-at-the-clipboardShouldn't iOS disallow apps to look at the clipboard? being closed by the moderator @nohillside

Even if the question doesn't have any merit, I'd like to know 1. How do we file a complaint if a moderator is misbehaving?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we file complaints about a moderator closing people's posts when he doesn't know better?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for asking here. We got some flags about comments being rude or unkind and will also follow up as needed if that continues. Asking here is the best way to complain IMO since everyone that moderates can weigh in.  Let’s spin off a second question if you need help editing that question or don’t understand why it was voted closed. Answering your “how to complain” seems like a great use for this thread so everyone knows regardless of the merit of any action on the question in question.


















I think beta should be burninated as it’s a meta tag. Beta hardware, beta software, which software all beg the question.
I strongly prefer beta seed program for questions about that service. In reality, macOS or iOS should be the tag and the beta status and version should be in the body, not the tags. Just like you need to be specific about what version of macOS you have when asking a normal question, doing that should be the gold standard and people don’t need any beta tag to know, but I understand the easy use of meta tags and popularity of them.
The down side is a meta tag might make it easier to ignore or follow pre-release software. I wonder if there’s consensus to make the tag beta-seed-program to be appropriate for developer seeds, public seeds other seeds and have it host questions about how to get in, how to apply and things that may narrowly only affect a beta build?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Counterpoint: Tags exist for the "Watch tag" and "ignore tag" functionality. I have no intention of ever installing a pre-release operating system, and would happily "ignore tag" anything for a version of iOS, macOS, etc., before its official release.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don’t recall hearing this and it’s a great use case for a meta tag. Should we still hone precisely what these mean - that can’t hurt whether we keep them, merge them or have more @Danielb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would prefer merging them as the best option.  To me, 'beta' is better than 'beta seed program' because the vast majority of people have no idea what 'seed program' means and might not select it, even though it would be technically correct.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fsb Would you make an answer with your precise proposed solution. I’ll up vote it and when you select it - we can merge if it’s safe - leaving the synonym. I think we have consensus from the 5 votes here to move. I’d rather the chosen action have less opinion and more clear - we are doing this to fix the issue raised.


















If safe, I request we merge the tags beta and beta-seed-program into one tag named beta.
The question should include the usual details about what beta program, build number, etc.  This will make it easier for people to follow or ignore and should help enforce consistency.

The idea is to tag all beta questions with the same tag as the question should include the required beta info, see bmike's answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for clarification!

so I posted a question here, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/395893/battery-discharging-while-plugged-inBattery discharging while plugged in
and it was closed for being similar, which I don't think it is besides being battery related...  I was told I could edit it and it would be re considered.  I did, but apparently not enough.  I was told I could redo it and I did and they it was closed for being a duplicate.  What gives?  Any help appreciated.  Stumpded.
from c/s email.....
Ok, now I’m thoroughly confused -
My question was closed as being associated with other question - but, it was not the same in symptoms and the other question is still open and not confirmed as solved.  Its marked as answered but not confirmed as solving the issue.  So, it did not address the issues I am having.

my 1st question was marked as having private feedback - where is it?  I can’t find it.

I was told I could edit the question and it would be submitted for reopening.  I did, but got no response.

I was told I could submit the question again.  I did.  Then it was flagged as a duplicate.  So, why tell me to submit it and change then flag and close it again?

I’ve reviewed the question guidelines and for the life of me can’t see what the problem is.  Can someone tell me please?


Tks
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So can someone tell me what's wrong with the question I posted below?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There’s nothing at all wrong with a closed question and duplicates. We love them and I tend to vote up any question clear enough to be a duplicate since they steer people to the primary answers for a given topic.


















Thanks for reaching out on Meta to have this clarified. I see two main topics here, first the reposting of a "on hold" question, second the "on hold" of the first question itself.
Regarding the reposting:

You posted https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/395867/battery-charge-status-decreases-while-plugged-in-chargingBattery charge status decreases while plugged in charging initially which got put on hold for being a duplicate of an older question
You reposted basically the same question again as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/395893/battery-discharging-while-plugged-inBattery discharging while plugged in

If you don't agree with the hold of a question, it's preferable to edit the  question and address the "on hold" reasons directly. This ensures that any comments added to the question remain visible to all reviewers so everybody has the full picture. This also means that your edits actually need to be substantial and address the issues. From looking at the history of the first question I don't see any edit at all, so it rather looks like you reposted directly. That repost was correctly closed as a duplicate again.
Regarding the duplicate:
Generally speaking we tend to close as duplicate if a question can be answered by an already existing answer. Said answer doesn't need to be accepted, it doesn't even need to have upvotes, but it should provide a reasonable explanation to your question as well. In your case the relevant part most probably is

As of Catalina (10.15.5) Apple has implemented a feature called Battery Health Management that will stop charging and allow it to discharge to a predetermined charge (about 80%) before recharging again. This happens even while the charger is plugged in and working.

This may or may not be applicable in your case, we just don't have enough information to decide. But right now it provides a valid answer for your question ("What would cause this? Ideas? Does anyone else have a MBP that decreases the battery charge while plugged?"). It also could be caused by the OEM adapter, or the battery could be faulty, but right now we don't have enough information. And while we can't expect users to be electrician or subject matter experts in whatever they are asking, we do expect them to do basic analysis and triage to clarify issues.
Now if you can show that the charge drops significantly below 80% while being plugged in (and edit that into the question), and that it also occurs with the Apple adapter, this would be a reason for reopening it as the answer obviously doesn't fit any more.

To give specific answers to your specific questions:

my 1st question was marked as having private feedback - where is it? I can’t find it.

The only private feedback in this case is "A community member has associated this post with a similar question." in the blue box on top of your question. I agree that in case of dupes this isn't all that helpful, for other "on hold" reasons there usually are more details. But as you did, comments can always be used to clarify holds.

I was told I could edit the question and it would be submitted for reopening. I did, but got no response.

According to the change history you didn't (or you tried to but the system didn't store your edit). In general when on hold questions get edited they get placed into a review queue for reopenings. It may take several hours or even a day to get reviewed.

I was told I could submit the question again. I did. Then it was flagged as a duplicate. So, why tell me to submit it and change then flag and close it again?

Didn't see a recommendation to resubmit, only to edit. If I have missed this somehow, please explain.

It’s unclear to me that the message right there that it was closed was the private feedback. As I did not know how to check status of resubmission, I emailed help.

I find making the question as short as possible and the answer as detailed as needed works best, but the editing process can clean up most posts if needed later.
Just be sure that you don’t put any part of the answer in the question section - there needs to be two parts since this isn’t a forum or blog hosting service.

Adding a comment to encourage the user to post the answer into the answer section is a good way to start. I usually also rollback the edit immediately so others don‘t take it as an example of how they should self-answer questions.
In addition, if the OP doesn’t come back within a few days and the answer seems to be worth having (so it wasn‘t a narrow solution to a user-specific problem) I tend to go back and post it as an answer myself (together with a remark about the origin).

I scheduled a To Do for a few days to check back.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a very kind way to do it. Another is public criticism. -1 the question, comment why it’s not useful (answer not in answer section, question could be more clear) then remind yourself to come back and thank the person, reverse the vote. Or do the edit and then vote as if the OP was on board. This is a hard thing to force someone to do. People that love blog posts and putting UPDATE, really love that wording. This is a hard topic to moderate. People can get defensive with a downvote, and lash out at you. Be prepared if you try this.

My gut reaction is we should pick one of the new questions and update an answer and link to the old question since Apple clearly had a rash of this in late September where the daemon was triggered and other breakage happened.
Not everyone needs to reset NVRAM, but for some that works. Not everyone fixes it with a reboot, some do. Most can now just patch and presumably things will quiet down.
There's a fix from Apple now - I've added it to the top of this answer:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/394141/5472https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/394141/5472

The fix for this on Mojave is to install the 10.14.6 Supplemental Update - build 18G6032
The fix for this on Catalina is to install the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 Update - build 19H2

After the reboot - check for build versions and that no OS updates are available. You don't need to delete any accounts or keychains or internal database files if you can patch your Mac with the Apple fixes.

Right now, it looks like https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/m1m1 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-siliconapple-silicon are roughly identical in coverage; most questions mention both.  Should one tag become a synonym for the other, or should https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/m1m1 exist to specifically cover the M1 chip itself (and not, say, the M2, or M1Z, or whatever comes next) and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-siliconapple-silicon covers questions about ARM Macs more generally?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5M1 tag versus Apple Silicon tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems like the second conclusion you came to would be sensible that way if someone is saying something about an M1 Mac which they need help with, versus an Apple silicon compatability question you've got two options and these will need definitions and some steering I suspect.


















Why do we even need an M1 tag to begin with?
The M1 is just the name of this particular chip - it's like saying "i7" or "i5" and we don't have tags for these.  We don't even have a tag for "Intel" though we do have one for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpcpowerpc and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ppcppc (synonym).
I think we should continue doing what we've done and tag the architecture and not the chip.

Create a tag for Intel based Macs (i.e. x86_64) now that we have more than 2 major architectures.
Create a tag for Apple Silicon based Macs (arm64).  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_siliconReferenced here on Apple Developer site:


the only significant step you might need to take is to recompile your code for the arm64 architecture.

Emphasis mine
I also think that before we start creating tags we should research how Apple references their hardware, use that as the tag and then create synonyms that help folks find the appropriate and correct nomenclature.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that it would be technically correct to have a `arm64` tag. I'm not so sure (end) users would find this tag though, the terms they are used to are "Apple Silicon" and (currently) "M1".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I said, have the arm64 tag and point M1 And Apple Silicon synonyms to it so they learn what the correct terminology isb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We use the tag `bonjour`, not `zeroconf`. I wish Apple would just call ARM processors ARM but if they're not going to use that name...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5arm64 could refer to Iphones etc. So not a useful tag (plus we ought to have a ppc tag for consistency - oh wait is that OSX or Macos 9 etc.. and powerpc shows that you need an os tag as well  ) Architecture tags are not sufficent and I think on this site not the correct way. The tags we are discussing are for macOS on intel and macOS on Apple Silicon - just a short way to say that. I believe that we don't like meta tags so having to express the idea as two tags is not goodb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We have never referenced the CPU in iPhones and iPads @mmmmmm.  We already have a [tag:ppc] ; it’s a synonym as I stated. “arm64” is how Apple references the chip in its documentation and as for MacOS 7/8/9, OSX, macOS, you’re conflating two different things - you can have a question about the hardware and not be required to tie it to an OS because it’s strictly a hardware issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The issue is that Apple silicon is not purely hardware. The questions are re macos on arm. Which is why an cpu tag is not that useful hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5“*Apple Silicon is not purely hardware.*”   Huh?  I’m not certain you’re referencing the terms accurately as this statement makes no sense. “*The questions are re macos on arm.*” All of the questions are limited to macOS on Arm?  There isn’t the possibility it’s simply a macOS issue or an issue solely related to the Arm  processors?  In other words, you’re saying there’s no hardware questions about arm Macs that’s unrelated to the OS?  Can you cite examples of this using  other architectures?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apple uses both terms, "Apple Silicon" and "M1" (see for instance https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211983 and https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210999), not sure whether this is intentional or just different editors using different terms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan The issue is that arm64 could refer to iPhone or macOS. Apple Silicon is macOS only so Apple Silicon makes much more sense to me as a tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just want to say, none of these tags seem particularly useful to me. PPC / Intel / M1 aren’t very germane to finding questions that I can tell but I’m open to being persuaded by some good wikis and examples of how these work better than searching for the OS in question and having enough detail in the body of the question.

It’s better to describe your research to define your workflow problem and how your research doesn’t solve it. That will be in topic in many places I expect.


















I don’t think stack exchange has a startup advice and service offering site, but the directory is here and each site has very detailed guidance about their intended scope and where things commonly are off scope.

Other than sprinkling iOS and Testfligt in the question, it really wouldn’t be different if you were a startup for Android, windows, or any game console.
You may struggle on stack exchange to ask advice and guidance and synthesis questions. What is the best “workflow” isn’t much different than the best “display” or the best “editor”.
This is covered very generally in the “what not to ask” section of help - https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask
It’s also something covered in many blog and meta posts, starting with this one explaining that real questions have answers and what’s reasonable scope. Managing a team depends so much on your skills, your budget that any answer tends to fall apart without very specific inputs. At some point you just have to do the work to manage your team and process.

Look at the reasons why gorilla vs shark discourages some classes of questions. Those ideas apply to your question I think and would result in lots of down votes if you ask this on stack exchange focused on using products as opposed to developing apps.

I don't have a portable and so never was interested in all the MacBook related tags.
However a question came up in the suggested edit queue where https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbook-promacbook-pro was definitely the wrong tag as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbook-airmacbook-air would be better.
However I then discovered that they were all synonymized to the same tag. Which is a reasonable solution.
What is not reasonable is that this tag is https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbook-promacbook-pro; surely https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbookmacbook should be the tag that is shown and selectable as people who have an air  definitely don't have a pro and so would not search for it or look at questions tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macbook-promacbook-pro.

If I had a macbook-air I would not look at questions tagged macbook-pro as that is a different machineb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, got it, the system doesn't auto-propose tag synonyms while editing. Yeah, that's rather confusing in this case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just wanted to “complain” that someone had added the `macbook-pro` tag to a question about an MacBook Air, but then noticed that they are synonyms. `macbook` would definitely be the better (and less confusing) tag that all other `macbook-*` tags are redirected to.

Also, even if it gets closed (which I doubt) the post will remain and should even be able to get votes.

I've answered a question today that has the [zoom] tag, and while checking the tag afterwards I noticed that:

it has no definition or use recommendation
it has been colonized lately by zoom.us.app questions (which I guess was not the intended use), as in the case of the question I answered

I've never created the use guide of a tag, and while I have no issue in reading some other tag guidelines and giving it a shot, I'd like to know what is the community consensus on the definition of the zoom tag.
In my opinion it should be used on the many instances of "zoom" functions when looking for "zoom" on the System Preferences, and not on the zoom.us.app which could have a separate tag if needed.
https://i.stack.imgur.com/5S6AF.jpg
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Definition of the "zoom" tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good question and thanks for bringing it up here. Without having given it much thought (about to rush off to a meeting), my initial view is that we'd want a separate tag for the zoom.us.app and we'd leave this for generic zoom functions. But of course, we'd want to ensure that we had some usage guidance on the tags (at a minimum, an excerpt).


















Unless we want to burninate the tag entirely, a second tag for zoom.app might help since the usage for this as an Accessibility feature seems to be the initial use in 2010. I’ve created https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zoom.appzoom.app and fixed three posts that were tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zoomzoom but clearly mean the app.

I don’t think we want or need it for questions on optical or digital zoom on cameras. (But I could be wrong if we unearth a bunch of posts on this)
It’s not a great tag for Accessibility since it’s part of macOS or iOS or iPadOS as well as that so a merge / synonym might be appropriate there and helpful for our tag system.
The third party app clearly has a lot of users during the pandemic, but do we treat it like Kleenex or Xerox or have a raft of meeting tags for the plethora of questions and tools (Teams, TeamViewer, GoToMeeting, Zoom, Blue Jeans, WebEx, MobileMeet, Adobe Connect, Google hangouts or Meet, FaceTime, Skype, Discord etc...)

We do already have https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/video-conferencevideo-conference

What do we do for any random app - have a tag for each one? I think having an extra tag here does not cause a problem (unless the app name mixes with some common Apple name - of which Zoom is a good example)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree @mmmmmm unless some several people care to curate tags, if we can’t pick one we should make both synonyms of something that is safe and self correcting. Let me try a bit more to clean this week and we’ll see if a proposal has consensus.


















I asked a very clear question and it got closed!
My reaction to this was “Why are you all so mean and quick to criticize? I just want some help here, not censorship and more work.”

 Actually, my first reaction was anger and hostility to a specific entitled know it all on the internet telling me what to do. Then, I remembered I an expert in this other field and maybe this know it all doesn’t even know what I know. But, I’m glad I didn’t lash out at them cause I’m awesome and those words would have been counterproductive.

One key reason my question was viewed as suspect was it had a line just like one of these:

I googled this and nothing helped.
I tried everything and none of it worked.
I could not find anything in google in a reasonable amount of time.
All the links I found are outdated and I wondered if anything has changed since then.

Please forgive me, that was the best “marketing” I had left in me to dress up my question before posting it. It felt good, but it also marks the point where I stopped analysis and being descriptive of my process to isolate the issue at hand.
Odd thing is, statements like these are both totally true and thoroughly unproductive to describe the sort of help I seek from an audience of thousands.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/tourI can remove this chit chat with an edit but I also need help adding the missing words that “show my research” so that https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/reopen-questionspeople with reputation to cast reopen votes do so.

iPhone SE (first generation), iOS 14.4.2 (18D70), iOS Safari
I have regularly used this phone to browse the SE sites in which I'm interested: Travel, Expatriates, Mechanics, Home Improvement, and Ask Different. The phone's now running 14.4.2; over the past months I've updated it promptly as new versions are offered. Keychain takes care of my passwords, and all seemed good.
Today, however, when I navigate to any of these SE sites, I'm confronted with this:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/eTNv9.png
Nothing has changed in the phone's settings, cookies are not blocked. Under the dialog, I am already logged in. Even odder, when I click on "Customize settings" there's a brief rotating wheel symbol, followed by...nothing: the dialog remains in place, blocking the page. I can only get rid of the dialog by clicking "Accept all cookies." The same thing happens on all five SE sites. It isn't happening on my desktop machine.
Restarting (both regular and forced) has no effect, the dialog keeps appearing. And the dialog is persistent — it appears every time the phone loads an SE site.
What's going on here?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New Cookie Dialog on SE Websites, iPhone onlyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't believe that this is isolated to iPhones or Safari since I have seen this on Chrome on my MacBook Pro.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@agarza Currently? In the past? Same behavior?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, within the past week with the same notification.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It appears people have different experiences based on privacy settings and so versions and content blockers.  For me, this is on iPhone safari and macOS safari and not iPadOS safari. But since it’s  happening on many accounts (mine included) on [multiple SE sites.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/362864/165931) and [this](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/359691/165931) and [that(https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/406344/475228)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This has more to do with SE than with Apple products so the Meta site might be more appropriate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike yes it does occur on iPadOS Safari - well at least on mine - note I do have an adblocker onb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for reporting. This is part of a series of related bugs that the team is currently looking into.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay after tearing our hair out testing across multiple versions and not reproducing any fails, we finally understand the issue. Safari specifically likes to remove all JavaScript cookies (**even first party**) after 7 days. Sooooooo, that's fun. But we can do some things here. It seems to respect HTTP-issue cookie durations appropriately, so on dismissal we're going to try making a server-side call purely for setting the cookie in a way that'll stick for Safari users. I'll talk with Samo Monday and you should expect us to try this early next week. We'll drop an answer here when it's in place.


















This appears to be related to changes SE has made network wide on settings they expect us to change or adapt our browsers to accommodate.

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/359358/we-re-adding-more-user-controls-for-cookie-consentWe’re adding more user controls for cookie consent

The text in that question asks for feedback and has a bunch of suggestions and changes as the feature was tested, so we might need a more focused answer here based on what to do today as opposed to the three months this was put into production here on Ask Different. (FWIW, I missed all the notices sent on this and didn’t realize till this question was asked that I needed to take action. It is also satisfying to just stop using the site when it pops up a window obscuring the content.)
The accept all cookies path wasn’t working for me, clearly. Neither is the customize cookies. Both buttons, when selected don’t function to dismiss the dialog for me on my Mac or iPhone whereas my iPad somehow got past this annoyance. I have no idea how my devices got this way, I intended to have all three function exactly the same. I have reviewed the settings and can’t see something I set differently on them.

Previously I have just clicked on *accept all cookies* on my Mac and work PCb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder f the code or backend database is changing under our feet @SteveChambersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Possibly, I've never used the customize settings button before this. Also maybe this question ought to move to **Meta?**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are dozens of threads already on meta - https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/362864/165931 included @SteveChambers ve linked back to here so the threads are easy(er) to followb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unless using an ad blocker, this should be working. We've also fixed the case (we think!) of ad blockers specifically. The intent is absolutely not to annoy you - it's to be legally compliant and be as seamless as possible. Ad blockers threw some curve balls here - in those cases we are trying our best to handle it the same as clicking no (because the ad blocker is preventing consent code from functioning). Mobile Safari is another issue...which I'll leave a comment on above shortly.


















It depends how you ask the question. I love a good reference question, but sometimes they need some help to pass muster from people that vote to close. We are here to help you if it’s really one clear question and you can show your research (even awful research makes a question very good since lots of people can share how to do better research, and it the Internet loves a thing, it’s showing someone they are wrong about something - we just insist the tone be civil and not personal when you say a post is wrong.)
We have specific guidance about asking for off-site reference questions. Here are questions closed with that request for improvement.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/394736/cheapest-mac-for-latest-xcodeCheapest mac for latest xcode?

Any of the above could get reopened once research is added and it meets quality standards as viewed by people with privileges to cast reopen votes.

Questions asking to https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254393/recommend or find a Mac, book, tool, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit this question to https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askdescribe the problem and what research has been done so far to solve it.

So, show your research, try to make it about someone adding experience to help you find a better resource than the best one you could locate. If you say “I googled and nothing worked” you can expect swift close votes, but even then no worries, we can help you with edits and get it reopened.

Stack Exchange switched from using a specified font in their stylesheet to using your browser default system fault on May 10, 2021. This would indeed change the appearance of the text on this site.

I noticed that https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/32724/237What are pros and cons for MacPorts, Fink and Homebrew? has come up due to an edit.
This is really an opinion based question but the answers are reasonable enough at the moment and is a common question that I think we should keep it. But editing it could be problematic as it is opinion based.
The issue I have is that the highest ranked and also accepted answer has reasonable summaries of the pros and differences of the main managers but starts with a definitive answer saying  Homebrew is the best.
I would like to remove that recommendation, which is opinion based.
The answer probably should be community wiki but as the user hasn't been seen for 4 years that does not matter much.
A problem is that some of what are given as benefits are can be seen as problems e.g. whether the manager uses macOS tools or installs its own tools. Should that be put into edits?

I am unsure how I should proceed in this particular situation: Someone else has given a good answer in my opinion but I could add an image to give some more detail.
I am especially referring to this post: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/422461/is-this-subscription-billing-mail-from-apple-genuineIs this subscription billing mail from Apple genuine?
I could add an image that shows how legitimate purchase emails from the AppStore look like, but it is in German.
Should I simply go ahead and modify this answer or add a second answer with that image (but my answer would most likely either be just a repetition or a very short one)?

It is almost always preferable to edit a good answer with a substantial edit and this seems to meet that criteria.
Edits bump and reward people for starting an answer, they are logged and easily improved or rolled back as needed. Only if the person asks to have a new answer would a second one be worth it.

Instead of picking up an argument, I reposted it [as a new answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/410739/333666).)


















What you're referring to are so-called https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/295232migration paths. They can be set up, but since we migrated https://apple.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/statsonly two posts to Super User in the past 90 days,
https://i.stack.imgur.com/byXzn.png
it's fine to use the alternative method as described in the https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/10249/295232FAQ:

If the site isn't in the list of available migration targets, or the question got closed without being migrated, first read the below points and consider if migration is/was really the appropriate action (in many cases, it isn't). If you think so, you can flag the question for moderator attention and request that they migrate it for you. Simply explain in the reason which site you want it to be migrated. (Please specify only one site; don't list all possible sites it could go to.)

What you did, leaving a comment and mentioning the right site so that the OP can delete and repost it there, is also a good option.

Not trying to be argumentative it just seems odd that if a post needs to be migrated *no matter how often that happens* suitable targets should be available. I mean if other targets are available maybe it would happen more often. And honestly I have never seen a post that asks a technical question that needs to be migrated to *Meta.*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not a technical question, no, but users do post [other questions](https://data.stackexchange.com/meta.apple/query/1423792/posts-migrated-from-main-site) which need to be migrated to Meta. And that's true for every Stack Exchange site, hence the default option to migrate to Meta. I can't imagine a Super User question being asked on [Gardening.SE] or [Sports.SE], hence [su] is not a default migration path.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The [Q&A I linked to](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/295232) contains some guidelines when staff will add migration paths. Even if we'd reach consensus here, I doubt they would be willing to do so. They have lots of things on their plate.


















What is unclear with this question?
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/422571/how-can-i-use-open-sea-maps-on-a-macHow can I use Open Sea Maps on a Mac?
It is short, concise and very easy to understand (The OP wants to use OSM on a Mac to create waypoints. Anyone using a map plotter on a boat immediately understands the whole concept behind this question. If you don't understand it, it is 110 % safe to say that you won't be able to answer it.) and I am very interested in the answer. Why does SE moderators always side with the stupidest of readers/users?

Edit: if exactly the same question had been asked but instead of tools for Mac, the OP had asked for tools for Windows, a reasonable answer would have been something like "Look at the tools listed at https://www.openseamap.org/index.php?id=navigationsprogramm&L=1https://www.openseamap.org/index.php?id=navigationsprogramm&L=1, in particular XX that offers the features you ask for".
Does a question become much more detailed/detailed enough by changing "Mac" to "Windows"? Of course not - and this proves that the commenters asking for more details are idiots, that should have STFU, and deserved to be called out on that. Their comments didn't add anything but noice (yes, the could see their own names on the "internet screen").

That question is locked since the comments devolved into name calling specific people “autistic” and “stupid”. Let’s let it cool off before we analyze or try to fix it. In fact, you might be better served by asking a more detailed question yourself and letting that one just be for a while.

Anyone using a map plotter on a boat immediately understands the whole
concept behind this question.

You make an excellent point that for people with specific domain knowledge, the question is perhaps easier to understand.
But your assumption that "stupid" people here, who do not know about the subject, closed it out of ignorance is wrong, in my opinion.
Domain knowledge does make it easy to understand a question and answer it. But the reason this specific question was closed has nothing to do with that aspect. There are multiple issues with this question:
Lack of research
The professionals who contribute an answer here are sharing their valuable experience and time for free. It is in everyone's best interest to make their job easier. It is lazy on the part of a questioner to post a question here without first highlighting how they have tried to resolve the issues. If they don't, it means more work for those who try to answer the question and this will discourage the professionals from contributing their valuable time here.
Allowing such questions can encourage other new members to imitate that style and reduce the overall quality of questions here, and thus StackExchange communities in general tend to demand more effort from the questioner. (More details here: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/261592/how-much-research-effort-is-expected-of-stack-overflow-usersHow much research effort is expected of Stack Overflow users? - the accepted answer to that question is of a harsher tone than necessary, but nevertheless quite relevant).
Lack of clarity / details

How can I use Open Sea Maps on a Mac?

As someone who wanted to try and answer OP's question, my first obvious thought was, "Is this a newbie mac user asking how to install a particular software on a mac? Does OP want a step-by-step guide to do so? Or has OP already tried installing it and is getting some error? Online search doesn't show a mac app for this, but only a website. So what problem is OP having in running a website on a mac?" ... and so on.

I want to make waypoints on sea marks, lighthouses, islets and similar

Again, the question that comes to mind is - "What specific difficulty is OP facing in doing that? Has OP searched online or read the user manuals?

and export to the plotter I use in my boat.

Ok, what is the issue here - does he not know how to export the data or is he having some hardware issue?
(Note that all this could have been easier to deduct and understand if OP had clarified in his question the research he had done and / or the steps he had tried so far).
Off-topic question
(Please refer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here?)
In its current form, an argument can also be made that the question is off-topic for AD (in my opinion). Just because a software is available for mac, doesn't mean this is the best place to ask a question about that software. While one can run MS Office on a macOS, it doesn't mean that questions particular to MS Office (or any other non-Apple software) would also be treated at par to more on-topic questions. The general exceptions are:

The question is related to how the software and / or its options are different on macOS (e.g. "On Windows I did this on xy software this way, but in mac this option isn't present on xy software - how do I do it on a mac?").

The question is about using the software with some other mac software or service (e.g. "I would like to save my Microsoft Word document on iCloud. Is this possible?")

The question is about particular issues with the software on macOS (e.g. "I have Microsoft Word installed. But all word documents *.docx only open in Apple Pages when I double-click it. How can I open it on Microsoft Word?).


(These aren't hard and inflexible rules, but broad suggested guidelines - the AD community here is more accommodating than other StackExchange communities that are stricter).

I'd also like to emphasize another important point - communicating by text posts online is difficult because the lack of non-verbal cues makes it easy to misinterpret or misunderstand something.
When people ask for clarifications in comments, or mods close a question, they aren't being hostile - they are seeking clarification. Please see it from that perspective instead of thinking people are being "stupid" or "difficult". Sometimes people may indeed misunderstand something obvious. But, be kind - please remember that everyone here is contributing their time and experience for free.

One small addition: I consider asking about how to make a custom table of content in Word for Mac to be on-topic, even though there might be better sites/places to ask than AD. Even then, asking just for "How do I make a TOC in Word" would get a question put on hold for lack of details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside I have slightly modified the content under "off-topic" to address your concerns.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All well :-) At the end I just have one voice/vote, as anyone else.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside The only concern I have is that encouraging questions for non-apple software may reduce  the topicality of the sub (from Apple experts to ... ??). On the other hand, I get yours and OP's concern too - due to differences between macOS and other platforms, a software for mac could have its own quirks that a mac user may be better able to answer. (I guess right now we don't need to be concerned with that and it is perhaps a concern for the future - if/when we start getting too many broad questions on non-apple softwares).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMHO software questions are fine as long as the software runs on an Apple product (well, that‘s also what the FAQ says :-)). The problem with the Open Sea Maps question is a different one, as you explained above.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside I think that is too broad of an interpretation of - *third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products.* I read it as, "You can ask about third-party softwares, in relation to its use with Apple products" - so, for e.g. "How do I install MS Office on macOS? or "How do I use iCloud with MS Office?" or "Are there trackpad gestures I can use on Chrome, like with Safari?" is more releveant and on topic than "How do I centre a table on MS Word on my mac?" because the former are questions that Apple experts / users can answer best.

I've run into an issue where I need to make an image of a decent sized USB drive. The only place where I have enough room to store that image is on my iMac. The issue is this drive has FAT32 and EXT4 partitions. So I searched and found https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/408984/54495this question on Ask Different. That question is closed in favor of another question with https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/46269/54495this answer by @Ian C.
Granted, it's an excellent answer, but, since the first question has no answers and has been closed, I am still no farther along in finding my answer than I was 10 minutes ago, after starting the search and looking into the issue of this question being closed. Without wanting to spend more time doing a deep dive into the history of the closed question, I find the closing of the question (or the keeping of it closed with a clear explanation why it's not a duplicate) either hasty or superficial.
The answer does say:

Now you've got a bit-wise perfect clone of your Macintosh HD drive.

That sounds authoritative, but if you have a question like the one that's closed, reading this answer does leave open room for interpretation: Is it only a Mac drive that gets cloned (since most of us know "Macintosh HD" is the name given automatically to a Mac system drive)? Does it read the partitions that macOS can't recognize? Or does it copy every bit on that entire device, whether the partition is readable by macOS or not?
I get that a lot of people have the technical background that they'll read that and say, "It's obvious." I don't think so and it seems that the person (@sekizuri) is unsure if it does and states it in his question and in one of his comments. After all, isn't one of the goals of this site to address answers for those who aren't as technically advanced as others may be? My impression is Ask Different is not designed for people with a certain skill level and above (other than at least knowing how to plug in a Mac and use the mouse and keyboard).
So sekizuri and I both do not, at this point, have an answer, and if the question were left open, we might. This question should not have been closed and I wonder if it was closed by those who do not get the distinctions I've pointed out.
I think this could be easily fixed in several ways, but all would need to be from someone who knows the answers and not from someone just trying to fix it or close the issue so it goes away:

Re-open the question so it can get a precise answer that leaves no doubt
Have someone who knows dd well specify the answer in a comment on that question
Edit the answer on the other question to add language to spell out that "bit for bit" does mean it includes partitions macOS can't read
Add that info in one of the comments on that answer, or
Add that info to one of the comments on the closed question.

My entire point at raising this issue, and spending enough words on it to try to be clear and specific, is that the closed question does not have an authoritative answer. The fact that I searched for something that's almost exactly what that question is about and that I still don't have an answer shows that gap.

With one caveat: the partitions and drive must not be in use. I updated the final paragraph in the answer. Solid ask there, thanks for raising it!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IanC. Thank you for your willingness to clarify here and in your answer. I know, for most people, they may interpret what you want clearly, but for some, it's easy to read that and ask, "Is that only in this case?" or something like that. I really appreciate your help there!


















We close questions as duplicate if the answers are the same, to avoid spreading information across several questions. If an existing answer lacks clarity or details, it's best to address this directly with a comment on the respective answer.

It may sound perfect to you, but is the goal with this site to help you and those that know what you know, or to help educate all users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tango Duplicating nearly identical answers isn't helpful, so asking for clarification beneath the original answer seems to be the best way to go on this. The site doesn't benefit if there are two basically identical questions with basically identical answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I get the point about duplications and, yes, as I've said, clarification in the original answer is a very good way to solve the problem and clarify the issue. Note I brought that up in my post here.

The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it https://apple.stackexchange.com/election/5#questionnairehere.


Ask Different is scheduled for an election https://apple.stackexchange.com/election/5next week, 2021-08-16. In connection with that, we will be holding a Q&A with the candidates. This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.
Here’s how it’ll work:

Until the nomination phase, (so, until 2021-08-16 at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 pm EDT on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post one question per answer.

If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of [text](link), as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.

This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into currently.

We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The following two questions are guaranteed to be included:

How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc. a question that you feel shouldn’t have been?


The community team may also include the following three questions if the community doesn’t supply enough questions.

In your opinion, what do moderators do?
A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?


At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. We exclude any suggested questions that are negatively scored.

We will post the final questionnaire on the https://apple.stackexchange.com/election/5Election page. Candidates will have the option to fill out the questionnaire, and their answers will appear beneath their intro statements.
This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&A.



If you have any questions or feedback about this process, feel free to post as a comment here.

The 2021 Community Moderator Election is now underway!

I'd argue that election periods should be at least 1 month long, and should avoid July, August and December, January, to avoid the main summer holiday periods in both hemispheres, and to increase the chance that slightly less frequent site users can participate?

Sometimes questions appear in a greyed-out form. For instance, here's a screen grab from just now, the first two questions in the list are greyed-out:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/u6VQL.jpg
I can't ascertain why this might occur. Sometimes the greyed-out questions have answers, sometimes they don't. Reloading the page has no effect. I don't see any other distinguishing characteristics.
What does this greyed-out status indicate?
EDIT...later the same day.
Seems to be a Safari problem. The greyed-out entries appear only in macOS (11.5.2) running Safari (14.1.2). Google Chrome (v.92.0.4515.159), Firefox (v.84.0.2), and Opera (v.77.0.4054.277) all display correctly.
Clearing Safari's history and caches has no effect, and the greyed-out status continues.
I've flagged this to be moved to http://apple.stackexchange.comAsk Different.

If one or both of you post this as an answer, I'll cheerfully vote it up and accept it. Thanks!


















Ask Different was sounding a bit outdated almost since the start of this site.
Maybe this generation of Apple was still borderline 'different':
https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWkO0.jpg
Definately not the case now.
I'm sure Apple would allow use of their logo, giving the site a new legitimacy.
Even the ⌘ with the white square behind it looks tacky now.  Not intending to have a stab at anyone, but as the web has evolved, and Apple certainly has, the site still seems "different" and I (and I know others from speaking with general industry collegues) avoid coming here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we rename the site to Apple?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: [Why is this site's URL not the same as its name?](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2697/why-is-this-sites-url-not-the-same-as-its-name)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi @nohillside.  That is different.  That is 5 years ago and that is about the URLb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this "can we" as in "is it technically possible to" or as in "are there enough people who would vote for a name change"? If it is the second, please elaborate on the rationale to do so. The site gets >200k page views each day and a lot of Q&As rank very high on Google (which is *the* main source for visits) so discoverability doesn't seem to be an issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The URL already says apple.stackexchange.comb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside The latter - would enough people vote for this.  I can only speculate that stats would improve.  It makes sense that once upon a time it was called ask different, but now ?  I mean it could just be the Apple stackexchange.  Makes sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside I know it does.  I'm talking about the name, logo, branding, button labels, everything.  I mean whatever ... you can only lead a horse to water.  If the site had started when Apple is what it is today, I highly doubt it would have been called ask different.  Apple is a slick industry leader nowb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you explain why industry people avoid coming here due to a name or do you feel the site design is the problem regardless of the name?


















I don’t see the site needing legitimacy from a name and haven’t heard of professionals avoiding it since the design was set to make it attractive for experts and professionals to be welcome so they can provide great answers. Any name change at this point would cause much more confusion IMO since the name is quite established.
Unless there’s formal agreement that Apple would let their brand be used (which would shock me, but you don’t know until the lawyers and business people talk) I would expect we couldn’t use any Apple trademark here for prominent branding.
Apple’s current trademark guidelines help form my option on this proposal being a non-starter.

https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.htmlhttps://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html


Web Sites: Web sites that serve only as noncommercial electronic informational forums concerning an Apple product or technology may use the appropriate Apple word mark, provided such use complies with the guidelines set forth in Section 3 above.

Since this is a commercial web site that sells advertisements and under the umbrella of a for profit corporation, we don’t seem to fit under the Magazine and Web Site clause but the company lawyers would need to give us a ruling on this.
I’d say vote for this if you think we should keep things as they are. I did vote up your question since discussion and new ideas are welcome, just I’m a “no” for now.

I mean, if people search for "Apple stack exchange" they get [this](https://i.imgur.com/0LZDs66.png), so what's the problem we're trying to fix?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like bmike, I upvoted your post because I also welcome the discussion. But for now, I am 99.99% certain we wouldn't be able to use Apple's name and logo as you would like, so I've also upvoted this answer. As for some rebranding, well, that's always a good idea from time to time if it's done right. But to my mind you would need to post a specific proposal and gauge support, and I think making changes would need to be very well considered so we don't create confusion.


















This is a great question and I missed the discussion on the SE Meta site.  Although I think a 1-week test of this change is bit short and can be misleading and the results be misinterpreted  I believe this site would benefit from having the accepted answer pinned to the top.
With development sites, languages and their associated activities can move much quicker from "accepted answer" to "doesn't work anymore".  In those cases, I would agree that pinning could be good way to stop the copy/paste of bad code.
On this site, things don't change as quickly or as often.  Good, applicable, accepted answers should be the first thing a person sees when trying to solve a problem or get more info.
When an aswer is accepted, it indicates that the writer of the original question found that answer to be the most helpful or correct for their specific case.  Having a close visual association of the solution to the problem is very helpful for everyone else reading the question.
Yes, there are times when the answer with the most votes is not the accepted answer and that answer is lower in the list.  While I don't have any specific data to back this up, based on my years on this site, that doesn't happen too often.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*"Yes, there are times when the answer with the most votes is not the accepted answer and that answer is lower in the list. While I don't have any specific data to back this up, based on my years on this site, that doesn't happen too often."* This seems to be supporting unpinning accepted answers. If your experience is that the answer with the most votes is usually the accepted answer, sorting by most votes won't change that. Also I'd argue that Apple related advice is similar to code sites in the sense of "this changed with the new macOS" or "do this on M1". Don't see the downside.


















If the accepted answer was, at the time, the best answer, then pinning it to the top is good.
However, if, over time, or even because the first answer was accepted too early, then another answer far outweighing it for votes deserves to be at the top instead.
This is rare, but not unknown.
Have a look at the most popular QAs sorted by either 'https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?tab=Frequentfrequent' or 'https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?tab=Votesvotes' to see how this pans out long-term, for the big hitters.
Sometimes, a question will get two or three very similar answers in a short space of time. If one is chosen quickly, or if the question hits HNQ, then the general balance tends to get skewed anyway. I don't personally think this exception is sufficient to justify keeping the accepted answer pinned, if another answer outstrips it.
It may, in fact, benefit the 'best' answer as voted by the community, rather than one chosen for personal reasons.
I think even in outlying cases where an answer becomes simply 'wrong' over time, to be replaced by a 'more correct' one - this will not influence the results unless the OP ever returns to change the accepted answer.
'Newly correct' answers take quite some time to outstrip the 'previously correct' even with the best of intentions.

If there were an option to parameterize this such that answers with at least 5, but no fewer than twice the number of votes on the accepted answer float above the accepted, that would be ideal. The accepted answer was, as you said, right at some point so should remain the canonical answer but tech does shift.

I’m tempted to mod lock the entire question / post as obsolete. Need to think over the options, but that seems the best way to handle an obsolete answer to a prominent post.
It was sure useful in the past but needs guard rails to protect people to make a new post or tread with caution using old information.

When googling apple-related queries, like "how do I do x", there's typically a lot of sites which are search engine optimised appearing toward the top of the results, and a lot of the time, the content is wildly out of date, or worse, not even useful but simply clickbait.
For this reason, I wonder how good or bad is it to ask such seemingly easy to answer questions on AD? That is, questions, which are technically answered on the internet many times over, but whose articles are buried between clickbait and worse, and whose articles are festooned with advertisements and other distractions?
I think for future people googling, Ask Different offers a far superior experience, being relatively ad-free, typically having answers from more authoritative sources than most other apple sites, and a range of other benefits (like being more likely to be updated, critiqued etc).
Example
Here is an example of an easy-to-google question I had recently:

convert heic to png macbook

https://i.stack.imgur.com/5dHTBm.png
Google results differ by user/location, but Ask Different didn't appear even in the top 100 results for me, which was surprising, yet a lot of notable "junk" websites did.
Question
Is there general agreement that asking "basic" questions is good for the apple product users, even if it means the occasional very banal question has to be asked/answered here on Ask Different, or should we refrain from asking/answering questions which are already elsewhere on the web?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it wrong to ask a question on Ask Different even if it's "easily Googleable"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I may be so bold, please say "web search" or something similar rather than continuing to provide free advertising to NSA's competition.


















This is a chicken and egg problem.  We aim to be the best place for Google / Duck Duck Go / whatever search tool you use to allow people to get high quality answers to specific practical questions, so I would say no - just because you could search easily doesn’t mean we shouldn’t host a good question for that topic.
However, the egg (or chicken) has to be good quality to be of use, so we should apply all the other question quality standards to all questions, those searchable and those not searchable. Good quality means you are specific and clear what practical problem you face.

Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs. This demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer.


if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.


https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask

The key point in asking is to do a search and explain how that search doesn’t help, so in that sense asking a question where you don’t do the simple search can end up with a quick closure due to quality or clarity issues.
In fact, your example points out we may need several questions with different wording so that those keywords surface the best thread or canonical question here on how to convert from heic to png. If the good answer is the chicken, we might need it to lay more eggs so people can find the source.
If you were to ask a quality phrasing of this question on the main site, please link in the comments here so I can take a stab at answering it for you. Be sure to document what search you used when asking!

Many of us are quick to tag a question as duplicate even when actually reading it shows it is different.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes @WGroleau that is expected and good. Having 10 closed questions linked to one is a good rule of thumb before we look at even making a canonical version of a popular question.




















I have a question about my Ask Different post: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/430517/how-can-i-unmount-and-erase-disk0s2-and-recover-my-bootcampHow can I unmount and erase disk0s2 and recover my bootcamp?

I don't understand why my question was closed. It's my first time asking a question. I did my best to provide a background of what I tried and a link to a lot more details to the summary if needed. I specified what I want to resolve. I was asked to post a diskutil list and I didn't see it for a few minutes, but after that I did post it. The thing is I can't open stackexchange on my newly installed MacOS X Mavericks because it's so old, and browser doesn't load it properly, and I don't want to update it now as it's temporary and my internet bandwidth is limited. So I emailed myself the text from terminal, opened it through my phone and posted it. It didn't post correctly so logged into the other old windows laptop and opened my email there and a to access the site and paste it. This took some time. I realized I didn't post it as a code and was going to edit when I noticed my question was closed and the post edited. I edited the post some more to clarify certain things further,asked for a review, yet the question remains closed. Why is this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd like to improve this, so can I know why this was closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your question is currrently in the 'reopen' queue.  That means that people who have the 'review reopen queue' priviledge will review the changes (there were a lot made after the post was closed).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah but I am struggling here :( I’d do whatever it is needed to speed up the process. Haven’t had sleep because I need to solve this issue. Is there anything else I can do?


















The site operates on volunteer efforts so sometimes it takes a week or more to close or open questions with no problems once they are fixed.

Also, doing more research and then showing you research with a clarifying edit can often help people decide to answer or vote to reopen.

Lastly, money is the typical way to get people to spend their time on your problems. Have you considered hiring someone with skills needed to help you fix this or learn?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright that’s fair enough. I was just desperate for help and honestly figured that the solution will be helpful to others that might end up in the same place because nothing that I researched worked. I have been at it for 2 days straight with just 4 hours of sleep. I believe I have finally gotten it to work through the terminal, I’ll update my question with the solution that likely worked for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That is super news. Let us know if you need more answers to the question and we might be able to help separate the problem Q from the answer A if needed. There’s no need to do more at this point, though. Glad you have a fix


















Sometimes the best edit is no edit when it’s not clear or the question has aged a year or more.
I can’t see anything making it better and attempts to fix the problem make it worse. Closing a question that doesn’t need more answers is always a good option. The body seems to me to explain that since the person doesn’t know how to click in Finder, they want to learn the basics of shell execution. Perhaps copying the title to the body would help, but I see no reason to do just that. I didn’t when I fixed the tags a few years back.

I have just seen that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-siliconapple-silicon and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/m1m1 are separate tags. I think they should be synonyms.
I think https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-siliconapple-silicon should be the base tag as it defines the architecture. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/m1m1 does not make sense as eventually there will be an M2 etc and most questions will be generic to Apple Silicon.
However when I suggested the synonym the web page rejected it as https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/m1m1 has been used more that https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-siliconapple-silicon.
Can moderators override this?
I note https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3975/m1-tag-versus-apple-silicon-tagM1 tag versus Apple Silicon tag but noone has done anything on this and I can't give it a bounty to get it looked at again.

The PPC and Intel and Apple Silicon tags all feel meta to me. Without clear guidance, they may struggle to stand alone and have limited usefulness for anyone to find questions. Let’s flesh out what each tag will be before we decide to make synonyms would be my advice. Precisely what questions belong to a tag and why not use other tags will help come to a consensus. Once we merge, it’s hard to fix, so I’d rather we have a couple extra tags for a few months than prematurely decide what to do here.
(And yes, https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/500/5472I was a bit short with Jeff Atwood about a somewhat analogous niche tag request before I had a few years experience here using tags, so I get the slight print of me arguing against “meta” or rare tags.)
If we had some great example of which questions this helps and how they can be used, it will make a decision more obvious. Specifically, we don’t really need tags for each iOS processor family since people have problems with phones and only occasionally with a specific iOS release.

Are you seriously asking a yes / no question?
Of course batteries exist to run an entire house and you can surely find many that fit in a backpack to power 4 macs at once full power.
Whether a unit like this is more hassle to you and more harmful to the planet than you using the integrated battery and draining it to 20% on your train commute is hard to say, but whole companies exist to serve portable power needs.

Your question doesn’t seem asked in good faith to me, but let’s see what others think of it. The comments on your post show how recommendation questions go off the rails and the need for an edit to clarify what you’re trying to do.
If you provide too much detail, people think you are obsessive and argue you shouldn’t do what you attempt. If you provide too little detail, no one can understand what the assignment is.
If you were to clearly document your research and explain why you think you can’t power a specific Mac and remove all side fluff, I would vote to reopen in an instant. That isn’t the question you asked so I placed a temporary hold to hopefully prevent it from getting 30 comments and no answers.

I get the feeling that you are suggesting I am stupid/ignorant because I don't know the answer, and that may suggest you're not wearing your moderator hat in this case.

I wouldn't consider it a shopping question as written, OTOH it's a rather unclear what your actual question is (and depending on the outcome of that discussion it actually would be a shopping question). Do you want to know whether

it is possible to charge a Macbook while using said Macbook to charge an iPhone
there are external powerpacks big enough to charge both a Macbook and an iPhone
something else?

The answer to the first interpretation is most likely a simple YES, but that you actually know already (because you can just plug everything in at home to test that). So it is either the second interpretation (which basically is a shopping question) or something we can't see right now.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"it's a rather unclear what your actual question is" There's only one question mark: "Can I run my laptop directly from an external battery at full throttle while charging my iPhone from the laptop at the same time?" Of course I don't know, I don't own a battery. I do know that Apple laptops are fussy about how and from what they will receive power, and this is by design, so it is not intuitively obvious to me at least that laptops will query batteries and say "Yes, I'll have some of that" while running. I would be great if it does, but I'd like some confirmation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still can't see how you can re-parse "Can I run my laptop directly from an external battery at full throttle while charging my iPhone from the laptop at the same time?"  into those other questions. Can you explain how it is not clear? I don't see any wiggle room at all. Either it works or it doesn't.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@uhoh I probably would have put the question on hold for either lacking research or being unclear, because: The only possible answer is "it depends on the battery and your actual power use". How would this help you?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh that would be an answer I can accept! I absolutely did not ask for help choosing which battery (thus my concern expressed in this meta question) I only asked if it can be done. If it's "Yes", then of course I will be happy and then I will have to do my own homework. And if it's "No" then I will be happy I asked here first and didn't follow solarmike's advice of buying one first just to see what happens. So "...it depends on the battery..." = "Yes" to my question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In a normal SE site someone would have posted "Yes this can work, but note that it depends on the battery" as an answer. But for some reason I find this particular SE site to be profoundly close-happy and condescending. So at the moment I'm sad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@uhoh For me this seems to be answered directly in your question, especially with the "Googling finds plenty of material on units that can recharge a laptop" part.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Recharging is not the same as the laptop accepting enough power from a battery to  run at full throttle. Recharging can also be done with the laptop turned off, or in sleep mode, right? Maybe the laptop will not accept as much power from a battery as it will from a wall plug for some reason. I simply don't know, which is why I asked the question.

What precisely is this relevant content and where is it displayed?

It's a setting which can be configured on all sites, but in practice it only does something on Stack Overflow, where you have (unless you opt out) a personalized homepage showing only questions in tags where you are active.
It's not a widely documented feature, but it was mentioned https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/349749/4751173here by then-staff member Nick Craver.

Closed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting
answers.
Questions must demonstrate a reasonable amount of research &
understanding of the problem being solved. Please edit to either a)
clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it
or b) include attempted solutions plus why they didn't work. In either
case, be sure your expected results are clearly presented.

"Off-topic" is a valid reason for closing.
"Lack of research" is also a valid reason.
But, "lack of research" and "off-topic" are two completely different things, are they not?  Neither one implies the other.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"off-topic" versus "insufficient research"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All the questions are closed because off-topic, which just means the question should not have been asked on the site. It's not that either a question is off-topic or the question lacks of research.


















This is one of the Community-specific close reasons. All of these lumped under off topic due to how the templates are coded.
We can not change the top portion, only the wording of the bottom portion.

You could make a case to change it on meta SE as sites all use common code base.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Intentional, to call it "community-specific" in the flag menu but change that to "off-topic" in the label?  https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/192086/shouldnt-off-topic-be-only-about-off-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@WGroleau All the closing reasons are for off-topic questions, which means we close questions that we consider off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@WGroleau "*design error*".
Not quite. SE is notorious for its learning curve, especially for a requirement of arcane knowledge.
One instance of this is the use of double-speak, where a word or phrase has a meaning that is significantly different from its obvious English meaning. In this case, while "off-topic" *would* apply to a question about Windows Registry in this Apple group, that isn't  what the term actually means. SE uses it to mean that the question doesn't meet the minimum requirements for questions on this site. Once one's brain can appropriately double-think, it all makes sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And _that_ sounds like "security by obfuscation."  :-)


















I began asking a question, that was more experience sharing, because I didn't know what the question was. After much terrible story telling and things I may have only wrote because they somehow chronologically make sense to me in to hope of figuring out my question.
Terrible question, but my train of thought did leave me to a question that is measured by my system and varies majorly when using a third-party device.
It's late, and I don't want to think about it anymore. three are a small number of issues causing bizarre behavior, even to the point of RMAing my MBP 16, but I don't think it's the problem I just don't feel like rewriting my question, even though it's pretty concise and an entirely new inquiry.

There is no such button because it is https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66238/295232automatically saved. This happens on the server and the draft is tied to your account, so if you use another browser or another device, you can continue writing. It also works for answers.

Thanks for reaching out. It's usually a good idea to add links to answers if people just mention applications, so thanks for that.
In the specific case, LibreOffice Vanilla actually is LibreOffice. From the description in the store:

LibreOffice Vanilla is based directly on the LibreOffice source code from The Document Foundation. It is recommended for users who want the convenience of installing from the App Store and getting automatic updates, compared to manually downloading and installing from The Document Foundation.

So to make a really good edit on the mentioned answer you could reference both versions and explain the difference.

It‘s sometimes hard to guess why some posts gather downvotes and others don‘t, and if downvoters don‘t leave a comment it isn‘t easy to improve.
One thing I learned over the years participating on AD is that the community tends to downvote questions which are border-line on-topic but seem to lack research. Also, questions which basically could be entered directly in the search engine of your choice tend to attract downvotes. And, to be honest, "Is there an updated list of US Carriers that offer the Voicemail Transcription where I could compare plan prices?" reads like something which indeed could be searched for.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have searched for an answer to that question using search engines but haven’t found any answer so far…b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW that seems an awful lot like a cross between "not about Apple software or hardware" and "seems to lack research." As it is asking a question about what carrier to use for a specific feature **and** something that could be answered by searching and/or calling the carrier's customer support at the phone companies available to you.


















I would like to know where to send my money so that Dark Mode can come to Ask Different. Stack Overflow has had it for two years and it is an absolute delight. I mostly spend time at AD in the evening hours and the difference between SO in Dark Mode and AD in its current Light Mode is - very literally in this case - like night and day. I notice that spending time on AD at night often interferes with my circadian rhythm (above and beyond just being irritating on the eyes).
I recognize that there are workarounds available by using third party browsers but, this being an Apple user community, I see no reason that we can't offer AD the same tool that SO has been offering Safari users since 2020 and not force users to change browsers. (I can give half a dozen technical reasons why not to use Chrome on Mac, too.)
From what I can tell, most of the pages on AD would look fine with basic inversion, so I don't see a big technical challenge in mostly copying the work that SO did to become Dark Mode-enabled and tweaking the colors a bit to match AD's existing design language.
What I'd like to know in this question is:

Does anyone have direct knowledge of whether this is actively being worked on today (and if there is a planned release date)?
How can I help to get this done sooner?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who can help us implement Dark Mode?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A literal bounty on a feature request - your attention and voice are appreciated as I know many love that look and just inverting colors isn’t enough to achieve this.


















Some new features, such as https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/345661/295232following questions and answers, are very easy to roll out across the entire network. Just update the codebase and it works. Dark Mode is sadly not one of those things; they'll have to go over all the sites individually (at least the ones with a custom design) and tweak the colors and images.
Some relevant references: the https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/395949/4751173announcement of Dark Mode on Stack Overflow:

Future releases

At this point, the focus of Dark Mode is on Stack Overflow and we’ll eventually bring it to MSO. While the retheming we did across the network two years ago makes updating our LESS easier, creating dark versions of all of our sites, particularly the custom-designed ones, is going to be a huge challenge we’re not able to contemplate at this time. The artwork on some of those sites simply can’t be made dark because we don’t have access to the original art files and, to be honest, some of the themes will always be better as-is.
and a https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/348482/295232discussion on a community feedback post, with an answer by a staff member:

Q: You mentioned paying off a lot of technical debt to implement Dark Mode on Stack Overflow. How much of this effort would be useful in expanding Dark Mode to the entire network? For example, would you need to re-implement it mostly from scratch on each individual site, or is there now a Dark Mode Module that can be installed, tested, and tweaked pretty much anywhere you want to with a much smaller amount of effort than was necessary to implement it the first time around for Stack Overflow?

A: From talking to Aaron... it's kinda complicated. We can't just turn a lot of sites dark because their artwork was designed with light mode in mind (excepting for Science Fiction & Fantasy, for the most part). So plopping dark mode on, say... Worldbuilding or English Language Learners or Seasoned Advice... would be pretty impossible without redoing their artwork... again. This is one of those... rare cases where beta sites have a leg up... :)

(copied from https://electronics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/7210/113522an earlier answer of mine on Electrical Engineering Meta)
As you indicated, Ask Different's theme is pretty basic and should be about as easy as the generic beta design. But Stack Exchange isn't working on this right now (they regularly publish an update about their priorities on the https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/09/19/the-loop-our-community-department-roadmap-for-q4-2021/Stack Overflow blog).

Please have a look at https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2180/how-should-i-ask-about-getting-a-software-recommendationHow should I ask about getting a software recommendation? to see what is important and what should be avoided when asking for software recommendation. There is also https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/ which focuses solely on software recommendation, please check what is https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicon topic there and http://meta.softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-informationwhich minimal standards are expected from questions before posting.
In a nutshell, asking for "the best" app or listing highly subjective criteria like "reasonable price" will increase the likelyhood of getting downvotes or votes to close/put on hold, as does lack of any research on the topic.
PS: Also, if you look at your previous questions, most of them received clarification comments which you only partially addressed, and answers which more often than not didn't actually recommend specific products. Editing questions based on comments received is essential to get good answers though.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm editing my question according to How should I ask about getting a software recommendation?. "Price is generally a poor requirement" seems an unreasonable rule, though - I need an app that literally has to do just **ONE** simple thing more than the free Stocks app, so it's only natural that I don't want to pay for it. However, according to this rule I can't put this constraint in my question. It sounds like more of a rule to make app sellers happy, than a well-though, useful ruleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DeltaIV Price is a poor requirement because prices will change over time, they also have different meaning for different people. So you may be willing to pay a max amount of 5 for an app offering specific functionality, others may be willing to pay 15. Please keep in mind that good questions and answers usually attract visitors in the future as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does a price of 0 changes with time? I don't think there's a big track record of apps, _of such a low level of sophistication as what I'm looking for_, that started as free, and then eliminated the free tier later on. Maybe they added some in-app purchase, or some paid-for tier with extra features, but I guess the free tier would still be an option even in the future. Anyway, since I'm not allowed to mention that I'm looking for a free app, I'll keep the requirement to myself.


















Both the first and the last paragraph of https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1630this answer to https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1629Why was my flag for "not an answer" declined? sum it up pretty nicely

TL;DR - moderators generally don't delete posts until they have several down votes or constructive comments if there's even a hint of an answer contained in the post.


We'd like to avoid patterns of flagging things as NAA without performing any moderation of the posts in question. Try to not load the flag queue with things that you can start to resolve if the community has given you enough reputation to start moderating these posts via vote, comment and edit privileges

This is valid for any kind of answer, be it just hard to understand or simply just a link which somehow seems to be within the context of the question. Why not comment with "Can you summarize the relevant part of the linked page directly in your answer to make it easier for future readers?" to give the poster a chance to improve their answer? This seems on the long run much more valuable than flagging answers for mod attention (because all mods can do in such case is either delete them right away or add the same comment the flagger already could have).
But I agree that there is some confusion with the reference to the castle post, I've reworded that part.

You'd probably have to look into whatever communities there are for automator to see if we can get it triggered on save.“ as it basically repeats the question.


















AskDifferent has significantly less active users than Unix&Linux, resulting in way less pages views per question. Your most-viewed question (https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/257396/remove-creative-cloud-files-from-finder-sidebarRemove "Creative Cloud Files" from Finder sidebar?) got 7k views (but is already six years old), your newest ones got below 30 views so far. So it's kind of obvious that it may take a while to get answers.
It's not always obvious why certain questions gather a lot of interest while others don't. But let me share my impressions on your two recent questions:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/443863/can-i-revert-apple-mail-to-its-previous-behavior-with-regard-to-the-search-boxCan I revert Apple Mail to its previous behavior with regard to the search box?
The only suitable answer here is most likely "No, this is not possible, get used to it". But usually people are reluctant to post such answers because it is not possible to prove that this is correct, also it could be read as slightly rude.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/443739/is-there-a-way-to-correctly-set-media-kind-in-apple-music-1-2-4-3Is there a way to correctly set "media kind" in Apple Music 1.2.4.3?
My first reaction to this one was "does Music even support audio books and TV shows, or are these media types rather handled by Books and TV today?". So, based on the way you framed the problem to be solved, it may not be solvable. Also, upgrades such as the one you did are probably rare so there might just not be enough people out there who had similiar problems already and found ways to solve it.

For the second one, your reaction raises a new question of how videos/audiobooks/etc. are even synced to iPods these days.  What is TV+?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@WIldcard Ah, the application is called TV, TV+ is the streaming service.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just answered part of your neglected [How to get my passwords out of keychain access](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400830/) question.

We're thrilled to announce that https://aws.amazon.com/AWS will be sponsoring Ask Different starting on July 22 through December 31. We wanted to give you a heads-up and walk you through what that means.
How and where will the sponsorship be displayed?
The sponsorship will be found on the right side of the header at the top of the site similar to what you see below.
https://i.stack.imgur.com/lGllL.png
What else changes?
Not a thing! Borrowing from https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307861/site-sponsorships-bringing-resources-back-to-stack-exchangethe original MSE announcement on sponsorships:

First — sponsors do not own these Q&A sites. Sponsors work alongside
our communities who ultimately build these sites. Communities ask the
questions; communities create the tags; communities conduct elections
as they do now, and we are not renaming our current sites like a
garish sport stadium to the highest bidder. Any ads a sponsor submits
still have go through our crazy-strict ad editorial process… as it has
always been. Companies do not have access to personal data, and all
Q&A content remains irrevocably licensed under Creative Commons for

Sponsorships are a tool that our clients can use to let folks who could be interested in their products know about them in a non-intrusive way.
What if I've found a design glitch/bug?
If something looks off, please report it as a https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bugbug so we can investigate and squash it.
That's all. If you have any other questions or concerns, please leave them as answers below.
Lastly, thank you. These types of partnerships help us bring more resources to our communities, and they wouldn't be possible without the work you've put into making Ask Different successful.

Did they give any rationale, apart from the non-intrusive advertising?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hmijail it's very likely they're sponsoring the Apple part as there's a lot of developers on macOS, especially given that it's already part of the stackoverflow filter bubble making it more likely developers are reading itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Makes sense.

You can always upload long log outputs etc to pastebin (or similar sites) and link them. Just make sure they don't contain any sensitive information.
OTOH, long logs hardly ever get read afterwards and are difficult to interpret anyway, so it may not actually help to add them. Usually just adding the relevant parts directly to the question is the better approach.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ok.  tks.  just making sure there wasn't a way to just use the site here.  As far as the log, id edit it, but I dont know what's relevant and what's not.  Seems lie there is a bunch of nothing going on taking up time, causing the long delay in making the files accessible on the external drive - what im trying to figure out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Definitely. Before you post more than 10 lines of text here, think to yourself, why would someone spend the time to review closely dozens and dozens of lines of text to help a poster if they don’t know how to filter and condense what they’re asking. There are good cases for larger chunks, but the system is there to encourage well researched and well scoped problems.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yep.  get it.  I posted it in the other thread.  I think there is a LOT of repetitive something going on in the file reading.  But, im guessing for someone who knows what to look for, and if were me, id use text search to cut through the excess.  I did not want to delete anything that may give a hint as to whats going on....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My first response was exactly what my fellow moderators wrote (but less tactful): no one is going to read a 60 page pdf. But you make the point well, Stumped – the idea isn't that someone *should* read a 60 page pdf, but in the hands of someone who knows what they're doing, a quick search might find the relevant information within that PDF, but the whole point of such expertise is that the asker can't summarize the file to the relevant bits precisely because they can't identify them. Well put!

Hi and thanks for the post.
Not an answer flags are the most misused flags here by far.
Duplicate answer indicates that the post is an answer. You should choose an other flag in this case and explain the issue.

wrong answer, don’t flag as NAA
bad answer, don’t flag as NAA
answer needs an edit, first make the edit (or wait for someone else to edit) then flag appropriately.

The main post here covering declined NAA flags is https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1629/why-was-my-flag-for-not-an-answer-declinedWhy was my flag for "not an answer" declined?
TL;DR - moderators generally don't delete posts until they have several down votes or constructive comments if there's even a hint of an answer contained in the post
So I declined your flag since there wasn’t a single effort to help the op. No comment, no vote, no edit. The person was clearly trying to answer, so I chose to leave it up.

When you detect a pattern of bad answer, absolutely flag them as other, but the harm in having basically duplicate answers with different wording is actually a benefit. Search engines index all the words and when people use different terms for the same thing, that makes the pose easier to find. Deleting content can harm the site overall. That is why when we close questions we like to keep 10 or so duplicates around before we try to start merging them or deleting the least useful versions.
Same for answers, rather than flag a bad answer, spread some upvote on the better answer and possibly the question.
Putting attention into the best answer rather than worry about culling less good ones that will end up below the fold would be my “advanced flagging” advice.

I wouldn’t give an answer that’s not good +1 unless it had something new to contribute @agarza I’ve edited the answer to hopefully make more sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds reasonable. Thanks for you time on this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My pleasure. I very much appreciate how many contributions you’re making here and raising this question on meta. +1 and sincere thank you @agarza


















Thank you so much for asking this.
Unless there's information that needs to be redacted, having a few deleted questions with a comment noting that you had mis-read the question or feel you want it deleted to allow other answers to shine is appropriate.
There's nothing to be ashamed of in your specific post and really no need to even comment as anyone with the reputation needed to see the deleted post will think anything of a routine or normal and expected deletion of the occasional post. There are two other, far less helpful answers hidden on that same question.
You're doing great and I have dozen and dozens of posts just like yours. Voting up other good answers is the perfect way to ensure quality content is here.

Just a reminder to be more careful in future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And a pro move is to set a reminder in a year, see if time has given you a better grasp and editing that post, undeleting it. This part of the question / answer lifecycle isn't common to many, but as long as the question itself is good, answers can take a long time to reach a useful stateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My apologies. That was a typo - the sentiment was “ routine or normal and expected deletion of the occasional post” which I’ve fixed with an edit @MartinR


















From https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/302226/295232this answer by a former staff member:

the idea is that when you see the indicator light up, it’s a reminder that there are reviews to be done if you haven’t looked recently. The goal is to draw reviewers’ attention to queues that can use some help.

It also contains details about the implementation specifics.

How to improve https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/450081/does-m1-support-displayport2-0this question?
I have searched the web (Bing), there is no result for this topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to improve this question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would imagine that the question asked is readily available at apple.com under specs for that particular Mac.


















As written in the note you see on top of the question:

Questions must demonstrate a reasonable amount of research & understanding of the problem being solved. Please edit to either a) clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it or b) include attempted solutions plus why they didn't work. In either case, be sure your expected results are clearly presented.

Can "I'v tried, but no result" be one type of "reasonable amount of research"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iUnknown You still could show where you searched and what you found, both in regards to what Apple offers and the general availability of DisplayPort 2.0. It may also help to be a bit more specific, right now it's not clear whether you ask about the specific iPad, the availablility in any M1/M2 based Apple device, or the capability of the SoC as such. Also, which practical problem are you trying to solve.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'v updated it, can you reopen it ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iUnknown If you ticked the checkbox to indicate that the edit addresses the reason the Q was on hold it gets placed into the review queue for reopenings automatically.


















I fixed it by adding an empty line after the table, but it looks like a bug nevertheless.

This question was closed:
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/451040/free-wysiwyg-markdown-editorFree WYSIWYG Markdown editor
with the motivation
Questions asking to recommend or find a Mac, book, tool, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit this question to describe the problem and what research has been done so far to solve it.

On the other hand, software recommendations are on topic here, as explained in
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3236/272604https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3236/272604
so I guess the issue is with the lack of research and/or problem description. Would this be better? If not, can you help me improve it? Finally, should I migrate to Super User in your opinion? I'm not sure why to allow software recommendations here, if the best course of action is to ask on Super User, but no matter: if you think I should ask there instead than here, I'll definitely migrate the question.

I've been using Typora as a Markdown editor when it was free (during beta), but now it's pay for use and I want to find an equivalent, free (preferably open source) tool. My requirements:

free (preferably open source)
rather than a separate editing and preview pane, I want the editing to happen in the same pane in which the  Markdown code is rendered, i.e., WYSIWYG. This is what Typora does
support for drawing tables, bulleted/numbered lists, code fences, import images, etc. Basically, the same features as the post editor on Stack Exchange, but WYSIWYG instead than separate editing/preview panes
rendering of math formulas
runs on Monterey

Research: I googled around a bit and I found the following;

http://mouapp.com/Mou app seemed to have been widely recommended in the past, but it's not being developed anymore
https://macdown.uranusjr.com/MacDown is active, but it has separated editing and rendering panes
similarly for https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdownVS Code

This is a global change. As far as I can see, you can click on the letter icon at the right of each message to toggle "read" state (and change the counter as well). There is also a "Mark all [as] read" option on top.

I actually kind of like the new behaviour, but it's also clear that not everybody needs a reminder to go back to old notifications :)


















I have been using the Stack Exchange iOS app for years.  Today, for the first time, I was unable to comment or ask using it for Ask Different.  It suggested that I log out and back in.  When I did that (I use an FB login), the FB login page told me that the FB login for that app was made "inactive" and that the developers of the "FB app" were made aware of the issue.  I then looked to see if there was an update available for the app, and discovered that the app was no longer on the app store.
Wow, I don't know how long this has been the case.  Anyone know if it's possible to get it working again, or should I not bother?  What do other people do to access Stack on their iPhones?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Stack Exchange iOS App is giving me errorsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For latecomers to this thread - TL:DR the iOS app is now dead. The final functionality was switched off over Xmas 2022 & now it fails to display any data at all.


















The app is no longer workable IMO as they are pulling the plug on the back end API. I can't speak for FB login, however and I hope someone can test that for you.

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/383026/mobile-app-infrastructure-being-decommissionedMobile app infrastructure being decommissioned

For most use cases, the mobile web view may be the best you get unless you can use the full app on Mobile Safari or your browser of choice on iOS.
In some cases, valuable API are likely to get renamed as SE Developers roll back the feeds and functions and also stop developing the apps with updates. There's a ton to love about a native app like push notifications, layout, lack of browser chrome, so this will be a painful transition for many I am sure.

Voting or replying to posts is no longer working, but you can read posts/questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @Tetsujin I'll soften my not working at all to I don't recommend it. I appreciate the quick correction on this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a great shame, imnsho. I know it was below par really, but while it worked it was my way of checking in when I am on the road. I can't handle it in a browser from a phone, there's too much 'periphery to data' ratio.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I stopped checking Stack Exchange while on the go once I lost access to the app due to getting a new phone and being unable to redownload the app.

If an answer gets deleted by a moderator - presumably because it was considered a duplicate - why would said moderator delete the first answer in the timeline, especially after the poster has put in time to clarify the question?  Should s/he not delete the second answer, which copies the first?
Sometimes posts are duplicated and a screenshot added to make it appear as if the duplicate answer brings something new to the thread (which it really doesn’t).
This not only lowers the quality and usability of this site, but also leads to a points collecting mentality in which adding screenshots to text answers becomes common practice - not to talk about wasted space and fostering illiteracy.
Its deletion also antagonises the poster of the initial answer (who spent time ascertaining the correct one, improving the question and subsequently formulating an answer), which s/he then might feel is a waste of his/her time and eventually stop frequenting the site.  This in turn leads to an ever increasing amount of unanswered questions.
At the very, very least and if it is commonly agreed upon that screenshots are necessary for less literate people to understand the post, adding it to the first and correct answer should be sufficient, which can be easily done via the “Edit” option.  The same goes for formatting.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why would a moderator delete the first duplicate answer in the timeline?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you point to any specific examples of this happening?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When you bring it this way of course the only possible answer is "Sure, you're correct, the mod is wrong!" however, **there is always more to it**. This is off topic here, ask this on the per-site meta and the relevant mod(s) can give you real answer, knowing all the details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Caution: I've seen many people complain about "duplicate" answers when the same result can *trivially* be reached independently. For answers posted close together but one has a bit more details, it could just be that it took longer to write due to the additions, rather than copying an existing one and including more things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you refer to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/453405/finder-does-not-show-file-extensions-on-icloud-drive, your post seemed to be more  a comment than an answer, was flagged as Not an Answer, and deleted based on that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Thank you for the explanation. I don't see much difference to the second answer (apart from mistakes omitted and the possibility of a bug considered).  If that's not enough, both answers should have been deleted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you @Shadow Wizard Chasing Stars and sorry for choosing the wrong meta forum.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@F1Krazy nohillside and the answer mention a specific example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally I don't see the point to delete duplicate answers, unless of course copy and paste on purpose. But each site has its own policies, and looks like this site is very strict about it. To change it, start a discussion here and if you get enough support, the policy might change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We don't have a policy against duplicate answers at all. But the post in question (cited below) read more like a comment than an answer so it got deleted due to that.


















Note: I was not the ♦ moderator who deleted your answer, but I can see why it happened. Yes, you indicated the correct Finder setting, but the answer itself is hard to parse:

Even with "Hide extension" ticked in the info window, the Finder setting...
Finder > Preferences > Advanced > Show all filename extensions
...is meant to prevent hidden extensions.

"is meant to prevent hidden extensions." is kind of a double negative, and it's also conditional ("Even with"). The other answer is much clearer (at least to me, being a non-native English speaker).
Stack Exchange is not about being the first to answer, even though it sometimes helps the author of the question; we're here to /tourbuild a library of high-quality Q&A about Apple products.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A "double negative" is something else.  The expression "is meant to" was used to consider the possibility of a bug, i.e. Finder should show the extensions, but could be malfunctioning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, I meant the negativeness of "prevent" and "hidden".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, the original poster specifically mentioned having to untick the "hidden" flag in the Finder info window for each and every file in his/her attempt to see the extension(s) - hence it prevents hidden extensions. But you are most likely right that skimming through (an embarrassingly short answer) might prove difficult for some.  But then what is the "Edit" option for?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Redarm Feel free to undelete and edit it to make the "answer" aspect more easy to understand. As written it's hard to understand how it answers the question asked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Thank you for the offer. But I don't like posting duplicates.  I just think it somewhat rude to delete an answer, because it subjectively reads like a comment (it reads like an answer in my head).  A polite nudge might be more constructive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@redarm Agreed, I should have left a comment.



















As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestiona tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year.
As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
-- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation

That doesn't eliminate the need for having https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/moderators altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.
So as we say goodbye to 2022 (and where did January go, right?) and dive head first into 2023, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0TPg.gifexciting stats.

Footnotes
¹ "Community" here refers both to https://apple.stackexchange.com/usersthe membership of Ask Different without https://apple.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsdiamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1user #-1.
² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.
³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-userGenerally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.
⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.
⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.
⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.
⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

The user editing the answer left a comment as well, about them not being able to post an answer on their own because the question is protected and they don‘t have enough reputation. So yes, a separate answer would maybe have been better, but having the additional information on the site at all has a lot of value (and the edit improved a rather short answer as well)

I wanted to pose this topic to our community members with the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-toolsreview privilege (part of the moderator tools) so they could share their reasoning behind the decisions to reject an edit.   From this, I hope we can emerge with…

clarity for new users (to the editing privilege) to understand what makes a good and effective edit and why edits are rejected.
best practices

Why are edits rejected?
This has been asked by individuals a number of times.  Below is (not comprehensive) a good sample representation of questions already posted on Meta.

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3267/119271Why was my edit fixing capitalization rejected?
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2794/119271Why are my edits rejected for being superfluous?
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3584/119271Why was my edit rejected?
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2471/119271How does the Community bot work when it approves or rejects my edits?

Why have I been banned/suspended from editing for X days?
Thankfully, I only found one post dealing with suspensions/banning (perhaps my search kata is rusty).  I take this as a good sign that this isn’t a frequent occurrence.  But since it can and does happen, it should be addressed as well.

https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3391/119271First suggested edit ban but still unable to suggest edits more than 24 hours later

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are my edits rejected (and why am I suspended from editing)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hopefully this will help clarify things for users and why it sometimes seems there is no consistency in rejections/approvals. Thanks for posting.


















When I process the review queue, I keep several points in mind:

Does it improve the question?

Is it timely?

Is this a new user who needs to gain some reputation for increased engagement?

Does it improve site engagement (will my rejection discourage new users from continued participation)?
One thing that I keep in mind is that editing older posts pushes down and eventually off, newer more relevant questions.  I believe that nobody wants to see their current question get pushed down the page for older, obsolete questions that are unlikely to see renewed engagement.


I’d like to believe I’m cognizant of the hurdles a new user must go through to gain reputation points an the desire for some of us with OCD to see a nicely organized site with consistent formatting and wording.
I have some rules of thumb that I go by when deciding on rejecting an edit:
Superfluous Edits (Formatting, grammar, spelling, and typos)

Edits to questions that haven’t had activity in (approx) a year or less will generally be approved unless they are significantly incomplete.
If the post is rife with correctable errors and only a few words like MacBook Pro or macOS has been addressed, I will either either Reject or Reject & Edit/Improve Edit  depending on the time I’m willing to invest.

Edits greater than 5 years will likely be rejected unless it is a highly active, still current, and the edit does improve the post.
This means simple typos or word usage/formatting will be rejected, but a fix in code or a URL will be approved.

Edit between 1 and 5 years I take on a case by case basis
Generally speaking if an genuine effort was made on a post that was in need of editing because it was a “wall of text”, in all lower case, mis-spellings, etc. I will approve the edit.   If it’s small, minor fixes, I will generally reject unless you’re a new user trying to gain footing on the site.  In this case, I will approve, but send a chat or leave a comment about editing.


Edits that Harm Posts
It goes without saying that any edit that causes harm (replies to the post author, changing the authors intent, etc.) are going to be rejected.  How do I determine this?

Replies.  Thank you posts, commentary, or anything that doesn’t directly add to the answer will be rejected

Updating the answer to the current year/version.. (IMO) this should be a new answer rather than an edit to an existing post.  There are users still using older products that may have the same question.  However, editing what seems to be an obsolete answer means the person searching for this info can no longer find it.

Link Updates.  These are generally approved as keeping links from going stale is a concern (it helps with SEO and ultimately site engagement).  I do visit the link to ensure functionality and prevent SPAM.

Code Updates.  Generally I will approve unless it’s very superfluous  (i.e. two dashes instead of one for command line arguments) and not very active.  I will reject code when making changes due to new versions (i.e. Bash shell versus Zsh).  I would prefer to see a small edit indicating the difference with the new environment or a new answer altogether.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One thing I'd add re edits that harm posts are those where the user believes they are making a correction/improvement, but it actually changes the original intent of the author. It would be very rare for me to approve such an edit. I might if the post is an answer and it's fairly recent and it contains an obvious error, but if it's been accepted as the answer and/or has received a number of upvotes, I'd be very hesitant to change it. Besides the obvious, it also often results in unintended consequences for users relying on the post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"One thing that I keep in mind is that editing older posts pushes down and eventually off, newer more relevant questions. I believe that nobody wants to see their current question get pushed down the page for older, obsolete questions that are unlikely to see renewed engagement." This feels like a poor approach to me. You never know when someone will come across an old question/answer and need the information inside. The goal should always be to make questions better. Perhaps we need to reconsider whether all edits should bump posts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wowfunhappy, thanks for the reply.  However, it’s important to note that peoplen*seeking* info will search for it.  However, those who answer questions don”t search.  We scan the current topics on the stackb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to disagree with older posts not being relevant/engaging. I get daily rep from very old posts and when I find questions/answers via google, they are often quite old and very actively used. Improving highly-viewed older questions/answers seems quite worthyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I addressed editing highly active posts in my answer @Mr.Boyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey, I've got a question here : I have seen [a post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/438644/489896) that could be improved (it's completey unclear to me as it is now) but it is over 1 year old and the fixes I could makes will not pass the +100 characters (I think). So, compared the the post length, it is a lot but it is actually quite a small edit in characters added/removed length. Will it be alright for me to edit it or would it be undeniably rejected? Thanks! :)


















Looking at the page source, the following two icons are loaded
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/apple/Img/favicon.ico?v=30f8d738fc74">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/apple/Img/apple-touch-icon.png?v=daa7ff1d953e">

Do the direct links still work for you? What if you switch browsers, do you get the correct Favicon there?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the response.  I updated my question.  The direct links work and it affects both FF and Edge but not Safari (as of yet).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@allan Firefox works for me, on both iPhone and iPad. I assume you did the usual cache cleaning etc?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, first thing I did was cache clean and it seemed the icon appeared “quicker” if I can describe it that way.  I’ll check on my Mac when I get home today, but thus far it’s on FF and Edge but not Safari on my iPad.  Safari still has the correct favicon.  On a similar note, I have noticed over the past month that both FF and Edge will seem to loose my session cookies because if I leave for 30 mins, but open up again, SE/AD presents me with the “Accept all cookies” even though I never logged out or closed the tab.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan For what it's worth, I've just tested using Firefox and Edge on both macOS and iOS and everything is loading fine for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @Monomeeth, I’ll keep investigating here.  This make no sense..


















Normally, when you gain reputation, it shows a little number at the top right of the cup with a star on it (next to inbox).
Why isn't it showing when you lose reputation as when you get downvoted? I sometimes come and get very surprised when I come to one of my questions or answers and see I lost some reputation without being warned...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why does it not show when you get downvoted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Before it used to do that. Something like -x reps was display in red.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Henry Do you have a source for that?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@grg It's what I saw when I first joined Stack Exchange. It was in the old top bar. I will go over some screenshots to see.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Doesn't clicking on the notification number show how that number was created including listing the downvotes (As I don't get bonuses from editing anymore then if it is not a multiple of 5 then there has been downvotes - @Thinkr is more difficult to see as they can get 2 for an edit)


















I still need to find a solution to my problem.
Can I repost the same question?
Can I "bump" the old question?
Do I just have to give up on this site (for this question) and look for help at another site?
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2290/if-an-old-question-wasnt-answered-is-there-a-good-way-to-bump-itThis meta question is kind of the same as my question.
Is a bounty the only acceptable way to "bump" a question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What to do if your question is already old and ignored, but still unanswered?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which old question would you like to „reactivate“?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Well, it's irrelevant now as I managed to find the solution myself (and I updated the relevant question with an answer).  However, the answer below will be useful if I ever have an unanswered question again, or if anyone else does for that matter.


















From the https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/7046/295232FAQ on Meta Stack Exchange; Ask Different generally follows the guidelines set there:


You can "bump" your question by editing it to provide status and progress updates resulting from your own continued efforts to answer the question yourself, or to explain why the existing answers didn't work. I usually do that unless I really hit a dead end with no further clues to follow. Sometimes I eventually bring about enough understanding to realize the answer, and then post a self-answer to my question.
If you have at least 75 reputation, you can https://meta.stackexchange.com/privileges/set-bountiesoffer a bounty, promising to give some of your reputation to a user who answers your question. This causes your question to receive additional attention, as it will be added to a special list and be promoted more than normal questions.
If there is an unsatisfactory answer, you could leave a specific comment on that answer to ask for clarification or suggest an improvement to clear up anything you don't understand.
Post a link to the question on the site's chat. Usually active users of the site will hang out there, and they can offer further help.
Use the share button beneath your question to advertise it to your networks. Then, if you find the answer, you can post a self-answer to help others who come across the same question.

Do not post your question a second time, as it will be closed as a duplicate of your first question, and may attract downvotes. Also, do not delete your question and re-ask it, as your previous question will be undeleted and your new one closed as a duplicate.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks.  That's a perfect answer, and it's in TFM.  Doh.  Anyway, I was editing my original comment as I worked on the problem so it turns out I was already following these guidelines unintentionally.


















Voting to close/put on hold is only available for questions. Once you have enough reputation to vote for close, there is a „close“ link beneath the question (similar to „edit“ and „flag“). This is shown as „close(1)“ when there is already a pending vote.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, this is mentionned in the help center. But I saw that it was possible to "see close votes" from 250 rep. And I don't see the close button, because it is obviously not available for me. I was just looking for this in order to check whether my question or answer should be improved, so I can do it in time before it gets closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You should see it under your own questions. https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/view-close-votes


















No, please don't. Those edits will bump all questions to the front page. Imagine if all question authors would do that as they upgrade their OS (iOS or macOS) or device ... we would have a hard time finding new questions to answer.
While it's good practice to include your hardware and software versions in your question, very often the problem is not completely dependent on the exact versions. That's a good thing, since it means other users can reproduce your problem, even if they are using different versions. But it also means updating the version is not really an https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editingimprovement, which is about the only good reason to edit a post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is very good advice. About the only reason I would update most posts is if somehow doing the upgrade was an answer to the original problem. The original problem still exists in the past, but the future might involve an upgrade to get to a solution of sorts...


















As other users already explained in the comments beneath the question, your problem seems to be different from the one in the (closed) question. So please ask a new one.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My concern is that the closed question is rather different from the dupes, but still marked as a dupe. I don't want it to get relegated to that same treatment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The best thing about asking a specific concrete question is that it's easy to SHOW in words how questions are different, and there are edits to help and even closes can be re-opened / reversed / revised over time as clarity and consensus arrive @Tango Having 5 or 6 duplicates isn't a problem here - in fact it's a feature since all the wordings help people search for, find and then get to the answers provided.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike Thank you. I'll probably post it tonight, since I'm tied up for a few hours. Honestly, due to what I'm seeing, I'm pretty sure it's a bug, since it's inconsistent - only some windows do this. Also, thanks for the point about dupes. There are some sections of SE that can be rather tough about such issues - it's frustrating to explain why a question isn't a dupe, have it closed as one, and have to push to get it reopened. Doesn't happen often, but it does.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You are correct @Tango these things often take us a week or more to unravel as moderators. No rush on the post - do it when the time is right and feel free to @ us in chat or link to it in the body of the post above if you want extra eyes on it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmike I may not be posting it. I can't duplicate the behavior right now and the spotty behavior makes me think it's a bug, not a feature. Also, thanks for the comments. There are sections I won't even go to in SE anymore because the community is so aggressive in sticking to the rules that they have little interest in actually helping people get answers.


















I want to propose a synonym for a tag, how do I do? I have read that it is available to create tag synonyms for users that have 2.5k rep but I don't know from when it's possible to propose a tag synonym.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to propose tag synonyms?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, just realised that you asked about synonyms. Rules are similar though, propose them on Meta.AD first :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside That's what I thought when I read your comment :-)


















I suggest making https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-16ios-16 and adding it as a synonym of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iosios.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iosios already contains https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/recovery-moderecovery-mode, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-betaios-beta, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-12ios-12, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios13ios13, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-13ios-13, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios14ios14 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-15ios-15.
Since iOS 16 got released in the end of 2022, I think it's time to create that tag and link it to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iosios.
I have seen a lot of questions about iPhone that were updated to iOS 16 or more and had problems.
I think this could be quite helpful to differenciate between iOS versions. Also, there are tags for every iOS versions since iOS 12, why could we not add https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-16ios-16?
PS: Why is there https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios13ios13 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-13ios-13? One of them should be removed don't you think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Make [ios-16] and add it as synonym of [ios]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Synonyms are just pointers, you can never set `ios-16` as a tag itself, will always end up as `ios` (try with `recovery-mode`:-)). So having version specific tags will not help to differenciate anything. I rather wonder whether we should get rid of the version synonyms (I also wonder why we made `recovery-mode` a synonym for `ios`, but that's most likely a different story).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Yes, that's what I noticed but I thought about following the trend of adding synonyms for different versions.


















The review icon https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/302226/295232may have a red dot under some circumstances, but on Ask Different we have many users helping out in the review queues (thanks a lot!) so that rarely happens.
You'd have to keep in mind that notifications (in general) are meant for urgent things; the review queues are important but generally do not contain items that need immediate attention; they certainly can wait for a few hours. There has never been a notification system, other than that you receive inbox notifications for suggested edits on your own posts.

IIRC, those were only suggested edits, and that counter has been removed more than five years ago ...


















This is just a simple "Hey!  Check out this new feature post..."
Microsoft added a sidebar and you can add in websites.  StackOverflow is already on their list, but you can add in Ask Different manually.  It provides a really nice list view of the questions.

I reviewed two “urgent” edits that were done because the editor referred to a Meta post https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/388556/287258Imgur TOS change on May 15th could cause the loss of thousands of StackExchange images!

 Nope!

My understanding is there's no need to panic or change most posts:

https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/424280https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/424280


SE runs a https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/08/18/new-image-upload-support/corporate version of Imgur, so image persistence is guaranteed.

I'd hold off on editing or making approvals based on the post you referenced... Good work rejecting those edits and raising the issue here.
The only posts where we might have a problem are those where someone uploaded directly to Imgur and did not use the corporate version.
This query may assist us in detecting any outliers from the "don't panic" mass of images hosted for this site via Imgur.

[This Meta.SE post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/388559/193295) mentions two types of IMGUR links: Those created with the "include picture" functionality (-> stored in the corporate version) and those uploaded by users before posting (-> not covered). I've adapted the [query mentioned for AD](https://data.stackexchange.com/apple/query/1742770/non-se-imgur-links-on-ad), there are 14 posts impacted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've edited two without a lot of thinking, but after looking at all of them, the loss of the pictures (or even just links to pictures) probably won't cause issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e514 is a rather tiny number - I don’t mind spending an hour or so fixing images if it so warrants @nohillsideb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@allan look at the posts and decide for yourself :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank so much for catching an important edge case @nohillside I hope my edit does it proper justice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside - there are actually [over 500 posts](https://data.stackexchange.com/apple/query/1742595/top-posts-with-non-stack-imgur-images-order-by-of-views) with images hosted on `i.imgur.com` that are potentially at risk. I've linked to a query that will link the exact posts that use those images.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mithical So, in the context of total number of posts on AD, it's still a miniscule amount. Still, may be worth pursuing edits in the case of the most viewed posts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Monomeeth - Indeed. The edits I suggested to start that process are what sparked this meta post ;)

Remove freebsd as a https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonymssynonym of the tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix  on Ask Different, please.

In the first place, what is the solid argument for freebsd being a synonym to unix on AskDifferent?

When I https://stackexchange.com/filtersfilter by the tag freebsd I'm not interested in questions tagged https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix on AskDifferent

Mac people use to tag their questions https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix instead of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macosmacos. For example, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/459137/how-to-let-clear-command-just-clears-the-current-screenhow to let clear command just clears the current screen

I'd like to avoid answering https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix questions to find out it's about https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macosmacos. For example, to avoid the comments in https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/365838/pipe-to-mv-commandPipe to mv command

It is not clear whether the questions about using the 3rd party software (FreeBSD, Linux, Ubuntu, ...) are on-topic here. If they are off-topic (see the answer) the https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonymssynonyms freebsd, linux, ubuntu should be removed.




If you want to improve something put the default first tag apple to all AskDifferent questions. The https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topictopics says it's monothematic:

Apple HW
Apple SW
Apple services
3rd party ... use with Apple products

Any browser tab label of AskDifferent should be of the form:
apple - <title of the question>

The rules are strange at the moment

https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/459137/how-to-let-clear-command-just-clears-the-current-screenHow to let clear command just clears the current screen: 1st tag macos in the label
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/431807/cant-partition-macintosh-hd-or-increase-free-space-error-shows-the-target-disCan't partition Macintosh HD or increase free space: No tag in the label at all

Answers to some questions from the below comments:
Q1: "Are you arguing that each name is important enough to have a unique tag here?"
A: Yes. The https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonymssynonyms gnu, freebsd, bsd, linux, ubuntu, sed, awk, posix of your tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix not only pollute the network-wide feeds but also disable proper searching by these synonyms at AskDifferent.

Q2: "Are you saying that all flavors of Unix should have distinct tags, none of which should be synonyms of Unix?"
A: No. Not all flavors. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnixUnix is a superset of many operating systems. Include them as needed. AskDiferent tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonymssynonyms for unix are: gnu, freebsd, bsd, linux, ubuntu, sed, awk and posix. If I search tag freebsd on
https://apple.stackexchange.com/tagsAskDifferent I get the 'Mac branded' description of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unix?tab=Newestunix! This is absurd. You should remove all the synonyms here and add them as tags if needed.

Q3: "'They can add both' is a counterargument to deduplicate them."
A: This depends on the description of your tag https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix. The current description is not sustainable in the long term. The mess resulting from the set of https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonymsunix synonyms, which are not synonyms even by far, is growing. Take a look at the https://unix.stackexchange.com/Unix site. Among the https://unix.stackexchange.com/help/on-topictopics are both:

Using or administering a *nix desktop or server
The Unix foundation underlying MacOS

Take a look at the proper set of tags. For example, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macos+freebsd[macos] [freebsd] questions. This is how your tags should look like.

Q4: "That implies some effort to retag questions."
A: Yes. Remove the https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonymssynonyms and create tags instead. Then, add these tags to the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix questions. There are 1060 of them atm. Nearly half of them can be easily recognized by the title: https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Agnugnu (10), https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Afreebsdfreebsd (2), https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Absdbsd (7), https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Alinuxlinux (226), https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Aubuntuubuntu (166), https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Asedsed (12), https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Aawkawk (3), https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+title%3Aposixposix (2).
Let the users create new tags as needed.

5: Quoting from the https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4208/on-ask-different-freebsd-is-a-synonym-of-unix#comment9419_4208comment by the administrator @Monomeeth: "Ask Different is for users of Apple products, be it hardware, software or service - all Apple. And, when it's about a 3rd party hardware, software or service, they're only on topic here if the question is about using them with an Apple product"
A: The answer by another administrator @nohillside contradicts your statement (in bold).

Q: "Not sure I understand the point about the apple tag."
A: Because of the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topictopics all AskDifferent questions should be tagged apple. SE concatenates a label in the browser tab from the first tag and the question title. As a result, all AskDifferent questions should have a label of the form apple - <title of the question>. Not in the form unix - <title of the question> if the first tag in the question is unix.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On Ask Different, freebsd is a synonym of unixb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure I understand the point about the `apple` tag: All questions here relate to Apple products, what is the value of a tag which applies to all questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, within the context of the site, can you list questions which would benefit from having a distinct `freebsd` tag? And if yes, would the majority of askers share that distinction?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyway, if you look at the [description](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unix) of the `unix` tag, it seems to be an appropriate tag for the „clear“ question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't support adding `Apple` as a default first tag. After all, Ask Different is for users of Apple products, be it hardware, software or service - all Apple. And, when it's about a 3rd party hardware, software or service, they're only on topic here if the question is about using them with an Apple product, so it's implied that every question relates to Apple anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However, if a solid argument can be put forth on removing `freebsd` as a synonym for Unix, I'm open to supporting that. But  I agree with @nohillside - can you list questions which would benefit from having a distinct `freebsd` tag? And if we went down that path, are you saying that all flavors of `Unix` should have distinct tags, none of which should be synonyms of `Unix`?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**All** AskDifferent posts are about Apple products, an `apple` tag is simply redundant. Tags should be used to make topics easy to follow, not to look nice in a UI.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[tag:apple] tag would be (or has already been) blocked as [an intrinsic tag](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/181772/241919) though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Microsoft is a vendor of software running on Apple devices, so a tag may be useful. We also have an adobe tag (and probably some more in the same category).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To repeat a point made earlier: which unix-labeled questions would *benefit* from a distinct freebsd tag? And do you have examples for AD questions which would *not* be labeled apple if we would have such a tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not much changed in [my thinking from 2019 on the unix tag](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3647/5472).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I rolled back your edit about what I apparently said. Everybody interested can read it directly in the answer below, also, if you quote me, please do so correctly and don't change the meaning while still attributing it to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You keep misquoting us and pulling statements out of context. Please read the first part of my answer more carefully.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The point is your answer contradicts not only your own [comment](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2763/separate-linux-tag-from-unix/3647#comment8712_3647) but the [comment](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4208/on-ask-different-freebsd-is-a-synonym-of-unix#comment9419_4208) of the moderator @
Monomeeth as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, not sure we get your point. Is there a specific practical problem in using AD you are trying to solve here? The whole discussion is rather theoretical at the moment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The „contradiction“ within the Q&A here comes from a misinterpretation of the remarks Monomeeth and I made, not sure how I can help you with that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Based on the user's Meta Stack Exchange posts, their main complaint is that they are subscribed to a network-wide feed of [freebsd]-tagged questions, and they're finding that the synonym here on this site is polluting their feed with questions that aren't related to FreeBSD. They want that feed to only consist of questions that are directly related to FreeBSD, so they want the synonym removed for that purpose.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@gparyani I read this out of their Meta.SE post as well. Just hope that they don’t expect a whole site to change their tags for something they can easily manage themselves (e.g. by just ignoring any matches their query gets on AD).


















I don't see the need for a specific https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/freebsdfreebsd tag as questions about using FreeBSD (and its variants) itself are as off-topic on Apple.SE as are questions about using Linux, Windows or VAX/VMS.
To quote from https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic (emphasis added)

Ask Different is for users of Apple products. If you have a question about a practical problem you are trying to solve as a user of...

Apple hardware
Apple software
Apple services including iTunes Connect (selling music, books, apps)
third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products.

... then you're in the right place to ask your question!

Any question here already has an implicit https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appleapple tag because all questions are asked within an Apple context.
This also limits the scope of all the other tags on Apple.SE, for instance the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix tag you mentioned above. Basically this tag means "question related to the Unix/BSD foundation, command line shells, or any binaries & scripts running in such a shell, within the constraints of macOS/iOS" (which basically is also reflected in the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixtag definition). Any answer to such a question is to be given within the Apple world.
Keep in mind that for most end users of Apple products (which is the audience of this site), "Unix" usually means "What runs in Terminal". So having https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/freebsdfreebsd, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linuxlinux and some other commonly used terms as synonyms of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix helps to keep the more "unixly" questions together, without getting lost in details. If people are looking for generic Unix answers (or even answers considering all the flavors of Unix/BSD/Linux/Hurd/...), then asking/searching on Unix&Linux is for sure the better way to go.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your statement: *`"I don't see the need for a specific freebsd tag as questions about using FreeBSD (and its variants) itself are as off-topic on Apple.SE as are questions about using Linux ..."`* is in contradiction with your previous comment on [Separate Linux tag from Unix](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2763/separate-linux-tag-from-unix/3647#comment8712_3647): *`"... unix is used both for questions relating to the Unix-like parts of macOS and for installing Unix-like OSes on Apple hardware. Both are on-topic on AD. ... I would be strongly in favor of a split here "`*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VladimirBotka I learned in the meantime that this would not have been practical because it doesn't help how well-structured and well-intended tags are: If users afterwards don't use them as intended, having too many detailed tags is more harmful than useful. But thanks for pointing out that I thought about this differently in the past.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's also obvious from the context that the idea of having separate tags never got traction with the AD community and wasn't pursued further.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a person who chooses FreeBSD over Linux by a large margin, I would love to have a tag for it (i.e. FreeBSD on MacBook) , but given the lack of engagement, it doesn’t make sense.  Maybe I’m wrong here, but anything FreeBSD related, I head over to Unix & Linux on SEb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan, Searching the tag *`freebsd`* returns all questions about *`unix, gnu, bsd, linux, ubuntu, sed, awk, posix`*. From this perspective, one might consider the engagement rather large.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How many of those are bona fide FreeBSD questions, @VladimirBotka?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd like to know too. See my first question in bold.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It was (mostly) rhetorical, there’s really not a lot here @VladimirBotkab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan, and it seems that it shouldn't be here anything at all. Among the [Unix topics](https://unix.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) you can find: *`The Unix foundation underlying MacOS`*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VladimirBotka if you look at the whole paragraph at https://wiki.freebsd.org/Myths#FreeBSD_is_Just_macOS_Without_the_Good_Bits, you can see that the relationship between FreeBSD and macOS is way more complex than just „FreeBSD is the foundation of macOS“. It‘s not that relevant though: if people have FreeBSD questions, they get good answers when asking at a site where FreeBSD people hang out. If people have Windows questions -> Windows-focused site. In both cases, AD isn’t a good place even though both OS run on Apple hardware.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohilside, the point is *`if people have MacOS questions about Unix, they get good answers when asking at a site where Unix people hang out`*. The [Unix](https://unix.stackexchange.com/) site provides atm 800 [macos](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macos) Q/A. All tags and their combinations `[macos][gnu]` (16), `[macos][bsd]` (47), `[macos][lnux]` (254), `[macos][ubuntu]` (94), `[macos][sed]` (97), `[macos][awk]` (47), `[macos][posix]` (12), `[macos] [freebsd]` (29) work as expected on [Unix](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That argument to nohillside’s point doesn’t strengthen your position @VladimirBotka.  We have 271 questions here that contain  “FreeBSD”.  The most recent ones are mine and most of the rest don’t ask BSD related questions but rather make reference to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Allan, this discussion is about tags and synonyms. Don't you see that the [synonyms](https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/unix/synonyms) *`gnu, freebsd, bsd, linux, ubuntu, sed, awk, posix`* of your tag [tag:unix] not only pollute the network-wide feeds but also disable proper searching by these synonyms at *AskDifferent*? The 271 [FreeBSD](https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=FreeBSD) questions at *AskDifferent* are not related to these problems. My previous comment was to show you what a properly managed set of MacOS 'unix' tags looks like.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VladimirBotka Both Superuser and Unix&Linux have a broad scope covering „all“ computers and „everything related to any kind of Unix and its tools“ respectively. AD covers (on the Mac side) macOS and questions related to it, so it‘s kind of natural that some tags are defined differently.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, if I would have to make a guess, most people in AD don‘t use tags for searching, and those who do use it to subscribe to updates on some topics specific to AD.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Yes but you can't do that with the unix tag and its synonyms as it is too broadb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mmmmmm Which brings us back to a question I asked when then question came first up: Which questions on AD would benefit from a freebsd tag while still being ontopic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My answer to **Q4** provides you with a hint. There are ~1000 [tag:unix] questions. ~400 can be easily tagged by the title. The other ~600 are potential candidates. This can be further reduced to 35 by searching [\[unix\] body: "freebsd"](https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+body%3A+%22freebsd%22).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside for AD I don't think the FreeBSD tag is useful. The split of linux, sed awk and removal of unix would be usefulb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VladimirBotka If you look at the 35 (or even at the 600) you'll see that most of them are not actually about FreeBSD itself, so a FreeBSD tag wouldn't even apply.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mmmmmm I would support a proposal to burry sed and awk for good.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Added https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4212/synonym-cleanup-sed-and-awk

We have questions on the synonyms for https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unixunix
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4208/on-ask-different-freebsd-is-a-synonym-of-unix/4209?noredirect=1#comment9474_4209On Ask Different, freebsd is a synonym of unix
https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2763/separate-linux-tag-from-unix/3647Separate Linux tag from Unix
One of the problems in doing anything is that there seems to be no agreement on what we should do.
The full list of synonyms is https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gnugnu, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/freebsdfreebsd, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bsdbsd, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linuxlinux, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ubuntuubuntu, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sedsed, https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/awkawk and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/posixposix
Following a suggestion made in the comments of the first question I support the removal of some of these from the synonym.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D+body%3A+%22awk%22+is%3Aquestion+closed%3AnoSearch for awk in the body of the question gives 7 hits of which only https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/274993/237one is specifically awk in the others awk is just part of the command line used.
Similarly for https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D%20body%3A%20%22sed%22%20is%3Aquestion%20closed%3Anosed there are 14 questions of which 9 are directly sed syntax and two are how to install GNU sed. So in this case it might be worth keeping a sed tag but just for those.
I could also see a case for removing https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gnugnu and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/posixposix from the synonym  as in AskDifferent they are not the whole system (in something like Stack Overflow POSIX does cover more e.g. programming APIs). In AD Gnu is about using gnu coreutils rather than the macOS ones.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D%20body%3A%20%22awk%22%20is%3Aquestion%20closed%3AnoThe query for posix gives 7 questions of which I don't think any need the posix tag.
Thttps://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bunix%5D%20body%3A%20%22gnu%22%20is%3Aquestion%20closed%3Anohe query for gnu gives 30 many of which are re differences of GNU coreutils vs macOS ones, a few are Gnu C related and others just show GNU in an error message. I think only the former might usufully have a gnu tag - and would be better as gnu-coreutils (However would a new user know that).
In summary I think awk sed and posix should be removed from the synonym and sed added back as a separate one. This can be acted on now.
I also think gnu should be removed but less certain what to do with these questions a gnu-coreutils tag might be the answer here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Discussion requested on a tag synonym cleanup - sed and awk / unixb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In tagging your question, I'm tempted to make tag-synonyms a synonym of tags... How meta and really who would follow one and not the other?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the idea of differentiating between a tag+synonyms for unix-style OSes (which, similar to windows, can then be mainly used for questions about installing them on Apple hardware (and, within limits, on configuring them to make the best use of Apple hardware) and a command-line tag for all things happing on shell level (with a clear focus on macOS then).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, let's start small. We don't really need a sed or an awk tag (not even as a synonym).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside re a tag for unix sytle OS well actually non-macOS-unix  is what I was thinking of as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even that is a distinction will be difficult to implement, probably.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well the staing point would be to ba the unix tag - then workout what tag would be usedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyway the point of this discussion is to ignore that non macos unix part and do the easier things on sed awk posix and possibly gnub2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside or other moderators - can you  start breaking the synonym - at least for sed, awk - then posix, freebsd and possibly gnu.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to remove the gnu, posix, sed and awk synonyms, they don't fit into the list of OSes we currently combine into the Unix tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMHO having tags for specific commands doesn't make any sense **on AskDifferent**, there are just not enough questions about them and if you are really interested in the topic, U&L is the much better place to follow them. It people start to bring them back, we can easily synonym them into `command-line`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, right, in theory we need to review all `unix` questions to check whether they should be relabeled to `command-line`. Not sure it's worth the effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside agreed on the review not being worth it - there is too much already there. I think the bsd and freebsd tags could be split off as well. freebsd has one question. But for any further change the unix tag has to be banned for new questions so a better tag can be chosen.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can't prevent the use of a specific tag, or the creation of a new one once users have enough rep.


















There probably is something on Meta.SE on this, but turning a comment "answer" into an actual one is fine, assuming some time (months) has passed between the moment the comment was posted and "now". Posting the answer as a community wiki is a good approach in such cases.
And of course, as always, answers which are more than just copy/paste from the comment are highly appreciated :-)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey, I have seen [this](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/460181/489896) post which is from a comment. I think it should be made a community wiki. (It also needs some details and clarity)


















This would be an SE-wide change which you would to rise on Meta.SE. But the system already locks a post while it‘s getting edited, so I don‘t see a benefit here. If you do multi-step edits, you can always delete the post while doing so.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed and the system is already written with code specifically designed to alert an editor that has started editing the post that another edit has committed to save and requesting the now second (slower) editor  to refresh their session before saving. This request seems to go against the design of the current handling of conflicting edits and would require that all to be reworked to implement this request.


















I'm going to chime in here because what I believe was the impetus for this post turned a somewhat decent comment into an altogether incorrect answer.
Regarding https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/459797/119271your answer which you sourced from a comment in the question, you rewrote the comment from:

   ...which allows you to "click" onscreen elements by typing...

to

   ...which can trigger a click at a specific place on your screen with a 
keyboard shortcut.

This answer is now incorrect.  Shortcat does not allow you to click on specific areas of your screen.
From the https://shortcat.app/Shortcat website:

Shortcat indexes your Mac's user interface and makes them available to you in a powerful command palette.

A specific area of the screen is an coordinate (X,Y) value where you can initiante any number of actions including a mouse click.  Shortcat indexes the elements in the preference pane so you can select them with your keyboard .  This is similar to the Alt key navigation in Windows where you hold the Alt key and a letter will appear next to each selectable element.
Answer indemnifications...
Finally, the comment starts off with an "I don't think..." which is a clear indication that the commenter wasn't certain but the person wanted to  be helpful.  Thusly, (and correctly) didn't posit it as an answer.
When an answer on the other hand,  starts off with this language it basically says "I'm guessing here so I could be and probably am wrong and here's a bunch quasi-related topics to read."  Not only that, the answer was paraphrased incorrectly, completely changing what the comment actually alluded to.
TL;DR
If you're going to convert a comment to an answer, make sure it's correct before doing so.  Secondly, if you must paraphrase, do so accurately.  Don't change people's original words.
How do you do you ensure that what you're writing is correct?
Test it out.

Also, the OP said that this solution, posted as a comment, worked for them; if that's the case and they explicitely mention it, why couldn't I post it as an answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Thinkr Do you *believe* everything posted with the words "it worked for me" is accurate?  You've posted several very inaccurate answers based on other posts/comments only to have it come back and bite you in the a***.  That question is 6 years old.  How do you know it works with 64bit operating systems like Catalina an newer.  Does it work with Apple Silicon?  You don't know these answers but you're writing an answer like you do.


















The reviewer was me (which is obvious from the screenshot).
If you look at the two screenshots and at Allan's post you link to:

337217 fits the "Edits greater than 5 years will likely be rejected" rule,
for 337221, "Edit between 1 and 5 years I take on a case by case basis" applies and, to be honest, while I strongly support the use of neutral pronouns in posts, I consider it a waste of time to go through all old posts to change "he" or "she" into "they".

Please keep in mind that each of your edits

takes your time
takes the time of at least two reviewers
bounces the question back onto the front page

So make edits which count and make a difference on the site by improving critical things. As a rule of thumb, focus on recent posts. As a more general rule of thumb, the older the post, the more substantial the edit should be.
PS: I've removed the ban.

(1) all posts mentioned (except 337221) are in a thread (question+answer(s)) that was itself bumped to the front page in the past 7 days - 337217's thread contained [this answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/366852/489896) which was bumped on May 13th. Then here comes a new sub-question : *Are those "rules" applying if the thread was already "bumped" quite recently?* - I was taking the answer to this as granted ("no") but it seems that I'm mistaken?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Thinkr All of these rules are to be taken with a grant of salt for sure, and there for sure are exceptions. But why try to find the hard boundary here and not focus on things which are worth editing and well within "age of post" limits? I think I said this already before: there is no need to use *all* your edits every day, you are also way past the "new user desperate to ramp up reputation" mark :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, yeah, you said this for upvotes when I first came to AD.

I'm not so sure what to do with it (even more if it's being menaced by deletion). Thanks ;Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@thinkr That looks like a good post to edit, most likely all posts in the First Question/Answer queue are good candidates. Having more experienced people look at first posts to help with formatting, clarity etc. is exactly the reason for having these review queues in the first place.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, thanks for the help provided. I'm editing it right now! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey again, I'm not here to complain but it seems that some users are not agreeing with you.

I've got a quite unusual question here.

We have plenty of well-received questions in the https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-storeapple-store tag, including questions about the online store.

I got blocked from editing again.
I wanted to know from when (ratio approve/reject?) I get blocked. For example, in my last 10 suggested edits, 7 were approved and 3 were rejected. Is this the ratio?
I'm not angered against anyone here (unlike my previous post), I just want to know from which point I can get blocked.

Just putting this out there for opinions.
Would having a “Retro” tag be beneficial?
I am thinking this could cover everything older than, say 15 years old (i.e. White Unibody MacBook) and include all platforms like PPC, Intel, and even MOS (6502).
I see an opportunity to attract more engagement from the Retro community where questions/answers could be easily categorized and even have an RSS feed (automatically generated like with other filers).
Maybe a “site within a site” of sorts?
It wouldn’t be in addition to the existing tag qualifiers, but more of a catch all.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retro Tag for Vintage/Obsolete Apple Tech?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What would you see as a benefit of a rather broad tag covering vastly different hardware platforms, architectures and OS versions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I added some context @nohillsideb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting idea. How do you see this working in relation to Apple's use of the terms *Vintage* and *Obsolete* ? We'd probably need to ensure there's no confusion between *Retro* and those terms. Apple uses 5, 7 and 10 years for various definitions (see [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624)).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I think that's a good idea. The only thing is that there are very few questions covering this. This tag won't be used very often and I therefore don't really see the usefulness of it. Do you think this could be used more often by broadening it in a way (I have no idea how but-)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That’s an excellent point @Monomeeth.  I “threw out” the 15 year time frame as a starting point.  I would envision this being past what Apple officially designates as [obsolete](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624).  Even though it’s obsolete, it’s still somewhat current a 2012 iMac, for example, can run Catalina and still be somewhat current today but becomes less so every year forward.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From SE's perspective, this looks like a [meta tag](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/08/07/the-death-of-meta-tags/?_ga=2.217216086.1171987271.1683128311-1119606515.1653407126) which is usually discouraged.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for "*to attract more engagement from the Retro community where questions/answers could be easily categorized and even have an RSS feed (automatically generated like with other filers)*", in addition to the personal Tag Watch list, Stack Exchange actually has [Filtered Questions](https://stackexchange.com/filters/416254/for-android-enthusiasts) supporting multiple tags that can be shared to and subscribed by anyone using RSS Feed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ask Different has been around for a while, and it's only getting older. When the site opened, someone may have had a question about a relatively-modern PPC Mac. Would that question get a retro tag added in 2023?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don’t see why not @Wowfunhappy.  There’s definitely a community out there that run these vintage machined. I have two PPC Mac Pros and and a white 2007 MB that I am working on getting to run FreeBSD (white MB is mostly done) and the native OSX. Having a tag will allow creation of a feed/filter that could be perused at leisure


















This post is intended to address a particular behavior, not a particular user. 
Comments should NOT be placed on questions/answers regarding related review actions taken.
After rejecting an edit, shortly thereafter, I received a comment on the answer:

Why reject an edit that actually improved the post's phrasing?

This is wholly the incorrect venue for this type of discourse.
If there is an issue with the actions of another user, the proper place to bring this up is in chat or here on Meta, not on the questions/answer comments.  Keep in mind, the OP will get inundated with all of the chat content totally unrelated to their actual question.  I know I don’t like seeing an Inbox with a double digit badge of unread messages only to find it’s all irrelevant chatter.
Why exactly did I reject the edit?
Primarily, it changed what I was trying to say.  I try to evaluate all edits (not just my own) objectively through the lens of improving the post.  That said, I will object to superfluous  edits because it appears nothing more than a thesaurus was utilized or tense was changed.  I rejected another edit in the queue because it changed a bulleted list to an enumerated one that ultimately did nothing to improve a ~2yr old post.
I rejected the edit because it did two things:

changed the intent conveyed by my wording
made incorrect edits

I’m pretty open with my reasoning behind my rejection/approval reasoning and I’ve posted it https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4152/119271here on Meta as a method of full disclosure.
I didn’t post “edits will be rejected that change the author’s intent” because it’s quite literally one of the reasons presented by the review system.
TL;DR
Comments are for clarifications, questions, issues with the post not irrelevant discourse.  We’ve all made this mistake (your truly included) but it’s becoming much more pronounced.  The reason why is a different discussion altogether.  That said, comments need to be relevant to the post and limited in scope. Anything past that should be addressed in chat or on Meta.
With respect to editing: do not change people’s wording because it has a significant chance of changing their intent.  Making edits to fix grammar is a delicate balance between fixing wording for  readability and changing the meaning; it’s not fixing typos or formatting.

I'm just raising a problem here with a question I've seen.

https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/327291Disable internal keyboard on high sierra

I have already posted a comment on the question saying that it wasn't actually a duplicate :

Hey. That's not a duplicate of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/298853/keyboard-key-stuck-or-not-being-recognized-how-to-fixKeyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix. The question is talking about disabling the internal keyboard, not fixing a stuck or unrecognized keyboard.

That question should (to me) never have been closed since the OP actually looks for a way to disable the Mac's internal keyboard :

Is there a way to fully disable the internal keyboard?

The person who decided to mark this post as duplicate probably just read the first sentence of the question (which could be answered by the linked duplicate) :

I recently decided to bathe my keyboard in liquid and have lost functionality in my keyboard.

I might just remove the answer part since your comment on it actually answered this question - see above comment for info on what I finally did and why.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It tends to pay off to read questions carefully and err on the side of caution before considering an answer. Also, especially for older questions, there actually might be a reason why nobody posted the answer which seems obvious to you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nohillside Yes, I'll try to adopt this approach for later. Thanks.


















What do we do with 'useless old questions'? Ones that never really defined the problem, will never have an answer & no-one would care if they vanished off the face of the earth. They don't provide any searchable resource. Dead weight. Not even perhaps through any fault of their own.
I don't want to single out individual questions really, but as I'm tidying up my 'followed' questions, I've come across quite a few that never resolved original issues with the question. Maybe the OP found an answer elsewhere, but whatever the reason, the question itself has just been left to rot.
You don't need to be able to read this, just an indication that whilst some questions are deleted over time, because the https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/auto-deleted-questionsCommunity bot has a set of rules as to how it does some of this tidying up itself, it can't handle questions which have multiple comments, which would be a feature of this type of 'useless question'. If we take these multiple comments as an attempt to properly define/hone the question - but without success - then there's no automatic cleanup.

Not all the remaining questions are 'junk', of course. As you can see from the pic, some got answers & were accepted. My 'following' list doesn't only contain 'junk', but really the only time I perform any examination of these is every few months in some downtime, I'll have a look back through the list to see which bore fruit or still hold some kind of interest. That could be the only time anyone looks at some of these ever again.
Examples, as I find them… I didn't want to single out any individuals, but in chat was asked for something to 'hang my coat on' as demonstration of the type of question I mean.
This - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/430761/how-to-prevent-finder-from-resettingHow to prevent Finder from resetting? - I never did figure out what the OP was asking. Maybe it's me being thick, but basically it got nowhere & I don't see it as having any future value for searchers.
Or this - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/429158/macbook-pro-13-inch-2016-two-thunderbolt-3-ports-reinstalled-high-sierra-bMacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) - Reinstalled High Sierra but cannot login the iCloud account - though a well-defined issue, comments had some guesswork as to how to handle 2FA, but nothing concrete. Problem 'went away' after upgrading. Maybe this one could have an answer added, if there is a method for dealing with 2FA on High Sierra [which I still don't know] or if the answer is just 'update to Mojave'.
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/438942/2017-imac-cant-boot2017 iMac can't boot - we have a lot like this, many with actual resolutions. OP basically couldn't connect for Internet Recovery. Comments beneath got hung up on the keyboard & confusing responses from the OP rather than looking to Ethernet or USB boot… but the end result is the question has no real value.
[I'm still going through my followed list - I'll add more if I find them]

Then take some sort of action on a periodic basis?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/452293/export-whatsapp-chat-with-replies is an interesting case: kind of relevant, kind of on-topic, nevertheless unlikely to ever be answered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see a little bit of value in (some of the) unresolved questions like this in that you can at least know that someone else had the issue when you search.


















Some thoughts on this (and I need more time to think about it, just wanted to get this out of my head and a comment didn't have enough room):

What's the downside of having these questions on the site (the three you mention have +/- 100 views each)?
What do we loose in terms of potential entry points in case we delete questions instead of finding one for which the unanswered question is probably a duplicate?
Which existing mechanisms can help, for instance Community Bot bounces, mod flags etc.

Also, some statistics

We currently have 22186 unanswered questions
4818 of them don't have any comments. This includes recently asked questions of course, but in general this might be a good indicator for questions which don't have a lot of value anymore.
Unanswered questions per month (people seem to have had more time for research during Covid, and Ventura brought new problems)

Some of my examples could be marked dupes or an answer found, but not the first one which is a true cul-de-sac. 3. I need to think more, too. 4. - 5. The bot would eventually sweep at least some of those up, zero interaction [wouldn't it?] 6. Yup, the reason I've even got this far is because I have enforced stay-at-home right now ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tetsujin Sure, they are dead-ends. But with 100 views they don't attract a lot of viewers anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5PS: Get well soon!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51. Yup, that's why I feel they need some sort of 'sweep up' as & when we find them & 2. Thank you very much. Well on the road to recovery - it's just a bit of a long road… but with an end in sight ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/248642/itunes-invalid-response-after-ios-update has the most views out of the unanswered/uncomment
