Examples include http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/Avatar, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695360/Korra and, to some extent, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278238/Samurai Jack. They're all widely popular American cartoons, sometimes even referred to as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime-influenced_animationAmerime.

Are questions about these series on-topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about animations or comics inspired by Japanese culture or styles considered on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question should be broadended to manga, with manga-like cartoons like Dreamland, which is from France and is even *drawn* manga-style, as in, right-to-left reading, IIRC. Same goes for Manwha and Manhua.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @Xeo -- we might need to extend this conversation to include manhwa. I love *Bride of the Water God* but I'm not sure if asking questions about it would be on topic here.


















Tough, I also had thoughts about it. I believe that by definition, we should not allow such cartoons, because we need to draw the line.

The line should be drawn at "Anime & Manga only", which by definition is only Japanese.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I tend to agree, a line has to be drawn. On MyAnimeList.net, Avatar has been allowed for only a brief amount of time, IIRC. The same goes for the French "manga" Dreamland, which has been removed recently.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this, ***however*** I believe manhwa and manhua should be on topic here. I've mentioned as much in my answer below.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do you define Japanese? TLoK has some episodes animated by Japanese companies http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Legend_of_Korra_episodes#Book_Two:_Spirits_.282013.29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierrot_(company)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BLCL: That's a very good, but a somewhat separate question. I've personally come to the conclusion that the best indicator I can think of so far is whether the original audio is in Japanese or not. For the specific (intentionally far-fetched, I assume) example of Avatar/TLoK being Japanese animation, I think it's pretty obvious to anyone that the decision to use a Japanese studio for some of the episodes in the second season of a sequel does not make the whole franchise/series Japanese/anime.


















Many anime are derived from visual/light novels, so it only feels natural to also discuss them here. What do you think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we also discuss visual novels, light novels and other related media?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Original discussion: http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/8282/expand-the-scope-to-include-visual-novels-and-light-novels


















I recently watched a Youtube video where an American asked some Japanese people what their favorite manga and anime were. One girl answered that SpongeBob was her favorite "anime".

It seems to me that Japanese people don't make the distinction between western cartoons and anime like we do. Therefore I'd rather be on the permissive side when it comes to which content is allowed or not.

On the other hand, I do strongly feel that there must be at least some Japanese influence to the show. Otherwise this site might just as well be called the Cartoons and Comics SE.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which then bleeds into my site of Movies & TV SE :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd like to take this opportunity to plug my [Comics & Sequential Art proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/47733/comics-sequential-art), then!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to clarify, anime-style drawing is or isn't enough to conclude Japanese influence then?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a reason for that. In English we have the words "animation" and "cartoon" to denote any and all animation. (Ditto for other languages) In Japanese, "anime" is that word, and just means "animation" - so the described response was completely understandable. The word anime was loaned from the Japanese language to western languages because western people wanted a word specifically for Japanese animation. So even though the word used is the same, the meaning of the word is very different in western languages compared to the Japanese language.


















I think this SE should probably be renamed to something so that all mediums of otaku culture are included, not just visual novels. 

There are light novels, vocaloid, doujinshi, etc. that would all serve well on one site since the demographics for these are very similar.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, I also have a few of the "Twelve Kingdoms" novels laying around. I would certainly like to be able to discuss them in here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this too, the demographics are indeed overlapping enough.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I agree on the suggested scope, I don't think renaming the site is necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I dont know why this was voted down, seems a pretty reasonable thing. I actually feel this too, because when I just started out, I wasnt sure if VNs were on topic. (At least it should be made more obvious from the site)


















I think light novels, and other paraphernelia tangential to the "main" anime/manga fandom should be on topic here. 

That said, I also believe the site need not be renamed to enumerate these items' inclusion. Most anime fans I know accept that these things are part of otaku culture.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that a rename is not needed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Second for both the inclusion of the media and for the not renaming.


















I agree that Korra/ATLA and Samurai Jack and anime-inspired Western shows should be disallowed.

However, I do feel that manhwa should be on topic. A lot of manhwa / manhua looks just like doujinshi or independent manga.

To clarify: I don't think anything that "looks like" manga should be on topic here. However, manhua and manhwa are the products of Japan's historical dominance of East Asia, both economically/politically and culturally. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Although manhwa / manhua, from what I saw, are generally left-to-right, not right-to-left reading. And if we go by looks, Dreamland would fit just perfectly. It's a manga written in French, really.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They have strong cultural ties to Japanese media, though, thanks to both Japan's economic and military strength historically as well as the sheer prevalence of Japanese media in East Asia. Japan is to East Asia as America is to most of the "West".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So basically it counts if the average person would mistake it for Anime / Manga, then?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RachelKeslensky That strikes me has an intense reduction of the larger cultural factors that have led to manhua / manhwa. It's not just "would a bunch of *gaijin* think it's manga" -- it's also about the strength of Japanese cultural influence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So do you want to include OEL Manga, then? I'd think you'd have a hard time saying one belongs but not the other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So you consider TLoK to not have strong ties to japanese media despite having some episodes animated by Pierrot (I'm assuming that lack of strong ties is your reason for disallowing) ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierrot_(company)


















I believe they should be off-topic. They're, as you said, better suited to http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.comGraphic Design and are more about the animation process (not unique to anime) rather than the medium itself.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. Unless the question deals with the cultural part of making Manga/Anime. If it's purely about how to draw/design something, it should go to [graphicdesign.se].b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are a lot of aspects that involve making a manga that don't involve graphic design, aren't there?  Like how to plan a story?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LeeHai Then that would be on-topic on [Writers.se]. These are ***not unique to the anime medium*** and thus would fit better elsewhere.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chirale It seems you feel very strongly. I suggest you make a competing answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or Audio/Video Production.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5see my comment on http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4/244 . This has **no** place to be asked on avp, nor on japanese, nor on graphic design. ***It would generate speculation***. They are no experts in ***japanese*** internals. Western internals are *not interesting in anime production*. Many consider western inferior. (Personally I so very seldom read western comics or watch cartoons, but love anime - it's for a reason: Japanese are generally *much* more advanced with it.) Japanese.SE won't do anime production, avp and graphics design are not japanese-specific. The only on-spot answer is here.


















Re: https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28/How do you extract texts into a text format that you can copy and paste from visual novels?

Should these questions be on-topic for this site, or should they be moved to Super User?

Also, I think this is not a technical aspect of a visual novel, but one of the visual novel engine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kirby visual novel engine is the technology behind visual novels, that's why it's a technical aspectb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's too early to answer this question. We have first to attract more VN questions to show what good questions about that topic are: it's normal to have borderline off-topic questions right now. We should not repeat the error made during the first phase of the beta, where some users leave due to high restriction, causing our user base stop to grow.

Several anime series have been made into live action series in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and elsewhere. Are these on topic for here?

Examples include:


For You In Full Blossom (aka Hana Kimi) -- TW, JP, KR
Boys Over Flowers (aka Hanadan or Hana Yori Dango) -- TW (as Meteor Garden), JP (twice!), KR
Gokusen! -- JP
Honey and Clover -- JP
Perfect Girl Evolution (aka Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi na Henge!) -- JP
Detective Conan -- JP
Maoh (aka Demon) -- JP
GTO (aka Great Teacher Oniizuka!) -- JP
Bishoujo Senshi Seira Muun (aka Sailor Moon or Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon) -- JP
Glass Mask -- JP

These are *just* the version I know about. There are also versions in PH (from the Philippines), VN (Vietnam) and TL (Thailand).


















Questions like this are more about the process of extracting text from a compressed video file. These are not questions unique to the anime/visual novel medium (they could apply to other types of files that fit the same parameters) and are thus off-topic.

Super User is a good choice. Also consider http://dsp.stackexchange.comDigital Signal Processing.

By extension, this applies to questions asking how to extract subtitles from a compressed file.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Visual Novels are not video files, they usually are combinations of text, script and graphics (sometimes video). Extracting text from these games is such a particular matter to Visual Novels, that software exists only for this purpose (such as [AGTH](https://sites.google.com/site/agthook/))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@CamiloMartin By your own description, they're analogous to videogame files. My answer still stands -- they're better asked on DSP or Super User.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What the heck does DSP have to do with this? As I've said, this largely involves extracting ***plaintext*** from a Visual Novel's engine memory at runtime, and visual novels usually use the same game engines and therefore are a very particular subject that anime/manga people are much more likely to know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Being nearly computer-illiterate myself, I wouldn't know how to ask this question at a site like Super User or Digital Signal Processing, and even if they gave me the right answer (which anyone will tell you is AGTH/ITH, both of which are VN-specific) I would likely not be able to follow the instructions. What the problem is with allowing occasional technology-related questions that are also anime-related, so long as they don't overwhelm the other questions (which they aren't as of right now)? The argument that they are not in scope is ridiculous, since we are currently setting the scope.

I'd argue we should only accept questions on the Anime/Manga versions. And not the later versions where it became live action series-es.

Simply because we need to draw the line somewhere, or there'll be no ends to it.

As for comparisons between the Anime version and the live action version, I think we'll generally allow it, though the line is rather thin. We'll allow because it does deal with the original anime as well as the live action. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's fair. How about questions comparing the two? As in, "What are the differences between YamaNade manga and the live action?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Aarthi: Good one. I guess that one would be very individual. I think we'll generally accept those, because they do deal with the original Anime/Manga. Much like if Naruto would make a real action movie, we'd be able to somewhat ask questions about it, as long as it's in the scope of the original series.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Excellent! Would you mind adding that corollary to your answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Aarthi: Added.

When I was asking a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/37/will-bleach-air-againquestion about Bleach (the anime), I wanted to use/create the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime tag, as I wanted to point out that the question was about the anime and not the manga.

I got the error that the anime tag is not allowed. Which is understandable (at first), but in this situation I suppose it was legit to use!

I suppose the same goes for the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga tag..?

My suggestion is to do allow these tags, so people are able to specify/narrow down about what they are talking.

Edit: I just see that the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga tag, is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangabeing allowed?

Visual Novels, Manga and Anime largely share the same target audiences, market venues, niches, cultures, and even categories (shoujo, harem, shounen, hentai, etc.) so I really think this is relevant to this site, and should be included in the FAQ.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't believe *genres* of anime need to be made explicitly on topic. Maybe H-series, but I don't think we need to enumerate shoujo, shounen, and *subtypes* such as harem comedy as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Aarthi what do you mean? I'm only saying VNs cover the same topics as anime/manga. I'm not saying we should enumerate these in the FAQ, I was talking about just defining VNs on topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ahh, my mistake -- I misread your answer! My apologies.


















So, after conferring with the team, I changed my mind. We're going to allow for both https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga because they would allow for users to filter questions better, and to allow for specific canon references.

That said: I think it would be better if we treated tags the same as on http://scifi.stackexchange.comScience Fiction and Fantasy, where you can just state in the question that this is about the Star Wars movie, or a specific Star Wars book, etc. The tag would be https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/star-warsstar-wars and the question body specifies canon.

So by using these tags it is possible for such users. Adding `-anime` or `-manga` to the tags could help as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Veger I disagree -- I think most people who are looking for info about Bleach will be able to filter out anime-only stuff from the manga without too much trouble. I don't think we *need* `-manga` and `-anime` tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is not about beach, but about the `-anime` and `-manga` tags in generic. For example, I am not interested in manga (much), so I would like to filter manga specific questions using `manga` or `-manga` tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With respect to your new/updated answer: You are saying the anime and manga tags are allowed, but discouraged? (as it is favored to specify in the question)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Veger I'm saying they are allowed, but ***I personally*** don't think we need them. I'm letting the community decide.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, clear to me


















I just had to ask but are discussions on hentai topics allowed here? It is something that people might end up doing here, so I just wanted someone to clear the air.

It seems like it should be allowed.  It's anime.  That said, it's probably also the case that it should be policed pretty tightly...but then, I guess everything is like that.  I don't imagine too many questions will come up about it, but I don't see any reason to police them any differently than any other question.  If it's a reasonable question, vote it up and try to answer it.  If not, vote it down.  If it's offensive, flag it.

All questions on here could be considered offensive if one person finds it offensive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KenLi : Right.  Which is why everyone can flag.  There is no one definition for offensive...so the SE admins built in the flagging mechanism to allow people to come to a generalized consensus.  I'm saying the mechanism for determining "offensiveness" is already in place, and probably better than we could define by trying to do so in a catch-all question/answer.


















I would imagine if anything, it would have the same rules as the failed http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3303/sexualitySexuality.SE

I think we should take a cue from http://scifi.stackexchange.comScience Fiction and Fantasy here; for a distinct work, have a tag for the work.  It doesn't matter if there's only one question for the tag, if it's about a legitimate on topic work, then the tag should exist for searchability as well as future questions.

If the work is part of a series, then a tag for the series can exist as well.

An example of would be https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macrossmacross as well as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macross-plusmacross-plus.

Perhaps, for series, we would want to do something like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macross-seriesmacross-series and then have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macrossmacross for the original and then https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macross-plusmacross-plus.

If this approach is taken, then we should request that https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/127700/140951the script that deletes tags that have a low number of posts on them be disabled for this site.



Thinking about this more, we might actually need more than one tag per series.  Given that each series has commonly accepted Japanese and English titles, we'll probably need to be able to tag the question with both of them.

I don't know that synonyms are a good thing here, because it might cause flame wars over what the preference site-wide should be (and we certainly don't not have the space for two tags for a series on the question).

Yes

There's no other way to identify which Anime is applicable to the question other than in the question title. This can get unwieldy - especially for longer titles.



And also for questions that apply to multiple Anime series such as: "To Aru Majutsu no Index" and "To Aru Kagaku no Railgun".

It's better to just apply both tags instead of trying to squeeze them into the title.

This is the very first private beta I participate in. From what I understand, it takes about (sometimes more) a week for it to be a public beta.

When are moderators for it elected? During public beta? After it airs as an ordinary site?

Many people only know a franchise by its English name, but some don't even have an official English name / title. What should be our policy on that?

I'd personally prefer the romanized Japanese and a tag synonym from the English one.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should anime / manga names / tags be in English (international title) or romanized Japanese?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This was briefly discussed in the commitment stage: http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/2941/anime-should-we-allow-the-use-of-romanized-japanese-titles
I think that both should be allowed since some people may know the international title and some don't. Perhaps Pokemon or Dragon Ball doesn't have that problem, but think of Zero no Tsukaima (The Familiar of Zero in english). Most people should know the first while others should know the second, and both should have the opportunity to reach it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question is not about what is allowed (We already agreed that both should be *allowed*), it's about which should be synonymous with which.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, I didn't understood. In that case, i'd preffer the same: the japanese as title and tags for synonyms.


















There are many animanga series that have a stage production -- play, musical, etc -- based on the source material. Is discussion of these productions on topic here?

Examples: 


Sera Myu -- Sailor Moon musical
Teni Myu -- Tennis no Ohjisama (Prince of Tennis) musical
Buri Myu -- Bleach musical

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are stage productions based on anime/manga on topic here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That depends on if you want to include all Japanese pop culture (which would allow these) or strictly Japanese comics/cartoons (which would not). 

Video games based on certain manga (e.g. Dragonball Z) would also need to be included if we decided to include these live-action works...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RachelKeslensky I think it's important to push the scope of the site early on. Anime has so much media that ties into it nowadays; it's different. It used to just be Audio dramas and OVAs. Now, it's everything.


















Having them in the English order at all times would make it unambiguous what's the first or surname, but it wouldn't honour originally Japanese names, in my opinion.

The solution might be similar to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/35/20my other question on anime / manga titles, with tag synonyms.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should tags about specific characters always use English naming order or the original order from the series?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And then we have the issue with complete name changes when a show gets re-released in another language.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RobotechWikipedia says it's an anime, and we're here to discuss anime. 

As long as it's clear that's what we're talking about, what's the problem?

As we see questions on these works we'll see how the policy develops, but I wanted to get an initial feel.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By that logic we wouldn't be able to cover the Battle Royale manga either, even though it was a novel first (and later a live-action film). Or for a more fitting "Western" analogy, we wouldn't be able to include "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" in a Western Animation SE just because it was a toy line first. The distinction feels silly because it IS silly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Robotech is a separate show, with a separate continuity, and a plot separate to the original three shows.  It reuses animation and such, but it should still be considered in all other ways to be a different entity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, but what about US produced sequels such as Shadow Chronicles?


















My personal thought pattern is that things about "what is to happen in the future" is something that should be kept off-topic. While I can cite that http://gaming.stackexchange.comArqade has these marked off-topic, there's still some back-and-forth on the subject matter. So for now I'd like to just lend my personal reasoning on the matter.

There are many kinds of information outlets on the internet. Knowledge is what we as a Q&A site provide, by giving authoritative and complete answers to questions. We're here to share understanding and comprehension. News is a completely different kind of information. Yes, it is something people certainly ask questions, and knowing an answer is certainly, well, knowing. But it's a different kind of information, and one that I don't think we're properly suited to handling. It's about what is up and coming, what is the happenings of the world.

A news outlet needs to be on top of their topic, they need to be proactive about their information before the masses even know they should ask about it. We're restricted on this front because we are a reactive service - we provide answers only in so far as people come in to our service. Which means that our ability to provide updates and news is only reflective of those who ask about it on our site. We don't have a motivation to seek out the latest and hottest out there because it's not in our mission to distribute this manner of information. 

We also have internal content competition because all of this "news" will be held in the same pool of content as the rest of our Q&A. The front page may be news stuff, it may be Q&A, it could be a mesh of both. Either one will push the other aside, and with popular and new releases they would both have the potential to obscure extremely notable content of each other.

News is a valuable form of information, and our ultimate job as not just this site, but as a network, is to improve the internet and the relay of information. However, I think that our system is very inefficient for this kind of distribution. It would be wiser for us to leave the distribution of news to other sites, and keep our strength at Q&A knowledge.

It *is* on topic, OP *is* asking about a Manga/Anime. It's just that the question cannot be answered, as there is no absolute information regarding it. In that case, one might only speculate, resulting in a debate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another thing to consider is that answers to such questions might be out-dated *very* fast, so I agree that they should be off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point about this site not being a news outlet! Had not thought of it this way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also [What should our FAQ contain?](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/10/what-should-our-faq-contain)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha Regarding close reasons, I feel that Off Topic is the best here. While you're right in that it is technically about manga/anime, voting to close something as anything except Off Topic usually implies that with some cleanup/rewording/etc., the question *could* be reopened (as closing is often a temporary state, not a permanent one). Closing something specifically as Off Topic will send a clearer message to users about the acceptable scope of the site and let them know that this particular area is not allowed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FAE: I see you (very valid) point.


















It really heavily depends.

I think that for most cases, the English name should be the main. Although we won't start calling https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemonpokemon as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pocket-monsterspocket-monsters.

It depends on the level of popularity of the English name against the Japanese, and how it was translated originally.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a shame nothing came of this. I have no idea if these tags are talking about Attack on Titan or a highschool harem romance without obvious titling.


















I think it depends on which name you use.  Use the conventions of the culture that the name is from, but respect the intent of the original work.

So if an English name is used in a Japanese series, then use the English name, as the creators of the series intended for the name to be represented in that way.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, even in original Japanese, there are characters with English naming order, for example Fate Testarossa from Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@xeo updated with some more depth for situations like that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I meant to imply in the question that originally English-order names should stay as such. It's more about whether even the orignally Japanese-ones should be changed to English order. Edited to make that more clear, sorry.


















Considering the topic of our site, I think it's important that we discuss the issue of spoilers early so it doesn't become an issue later. With that in mind, things we need to address:


When should spoilers be permitted in titles?
When should we require users to include spoiler markdown in the question body?
When should we require users to include spoiler markdown in answers?
What do we consider a spoiler? 

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our policy be regarding spoilers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that 'spoiler' should be defined as: something that adds information to the 'basic' info of the show. i.e., someone that has seen/read 10-some episodes/chapters is in possession of this 'basic' info. Anything more than this should be regarded as spoiler. IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 That sounds like a reasonable guideline. Like I detail in my post, I don't think we're going to be able to come up with an absolute set of guidelines for what a spoiler is. It's going to be something we handle more on a case by case basis.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just leaving a comment here to state that I no longer think my proposed definition of spoiler is a good one. At least not in every case.


















When should spoilers be permitted in titles?
The rule I've always followed is to include spoilers in your title only if it's required for the title to be searchable, and clearly indicate what the question is about. In other words, if you can make a good title without spoilers, do so; otherwise include spoilers. A good title is more important than spoilers. After all, the ignore tag feature will allow users to ignore any tags in a series they wish to avoid spoilers about.
When should we require users to include spoiler markdown in the question body?
Spoilers should be used for events beyond what the scope of the title suggests.
When should we require users to include spoiler markdown in answers?
Spoilers should be used when discussing events or theories which contain information revealed later in the series than the question. For example, if I ask "Why does Joe kill Bob in Chapter 3?", but this isn't answered until chapter 15, the answer should make heavy user of spoiler markdown (ideally you'd want to format the answer as "This is revealed in chapter 15: spoilers go here)
What do we consider a spoiler?
This is the tricky part, since everyone has a different bar for when they consider something to be a spoiler, and is something which I think we'll develop over time as a community. For a start, we can obviously classify major events as spoilers. Outside of that though, I'm not really sure. I don't think we'll be able to come up with hard and fast rules for this, and is something we'll need to handle more on a case-by-case basis as opposed to have a set of rules typed up which capture every situation.
Should we make use of a spoiler tag?
No. A spoiler tag suffers from a few problems.
First, it takes up tag space. We can only have 5 tags on a question, which may seem like a lot, but do you really want to give up a fifth tag that one time you Really need it because you need to include a spoiler tag?
Second, the sites method for determining which tag shows up in the title of the page is decided by popularity. Do we really want spoiler to show up in the page title over other tags like. Since a spoiler tag is generic it will be among one of the more popular tags on the site, and likely to be the top tag on most questions where it used.
It's also not useful as a filtering mechanism, since no one is going to ignore all tags with spoiler. It just wouldn't work. After all, I don't want to ignore questions with spoiler, I want to ignore questions from specific series. The spoiler ignore would just hide questions from series I want to see.
The tag itself also doesn't reveal to a user whether or not it's a spoiler for them. If a title is ambiguous so as to not to reveal what the spoiler is, then how does adding a spoiler tag reveal what it is? If it's a spoiler for a portion of the story I have yet to reach, then how will the tag let me know that? All I know is that there is a spoiler of some kind in the question, but the title should be enough for me to realize this. If that isn't the case, then tossing in the tag doesn't help. Making proper use of spoiler mark down would be considerably  more useful for revealing when and where the spoilers take place, and if it's a question I should avoid reading without actually spoiling anything for me.
Finally, it will be overused to the point of being useless. Considering the nature of our site the vast majority of our questions will contain some type of spoiler, making the tag required on all questions. Do we really want that? I think not.
Should we include the word "spoilers" in the title?"
Including the word "Spoiler" in a title is a bad idea. It makes the title less natural, and just creates clutter. Titles should be clear, and concise. A similar way to look at this is from searching. No one is going to search "SPOILER What happens at the end of chapter 15?". If no one is going to search it, then does it really need to be in the title?
It also suffers from the same problem that the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spoilerspoiler tag does, which is that it becomes pointless due to overuse. If most titles have spoiler at the start, I'm eventually going to just start ignoring the word all together.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Every discussion about the anime series I'm watching that's had a long run in Japan is a spoiler to me.  I find it tough to do searches on them for that very reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding the spoiler tag, there was exactly the same discussion going on over at Arqade, so I completely follow your proposition. However the real question is: how are we going to enforce the use of the spoiler block? I think this will be a very important responsibility of our mods.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Anzeo This is something can be enforced by mods *and* users. If you see a question which should have a spoiler block, just edit it in and leave a comment explaining why you added it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could you flag for spoilers? Or would this lead to the same 'noise' as a spoiler tag would?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Anzeo There wouldn't be any needs to, since you can just edit the question yourself. If it's in a comment I would fully support flagging and remove spoilers when they're not relevant and unnecessary.


















Should be allowed questions like "Where AnimExpo will be?" or "How many people went to Comiket 83?" be allowed?
Some could be intereting, while lots others will not as being too localized, so should there be a policy regarding this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should event-related topics be allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why the downvotes? Isn't It a common sense question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Downvotes on metas mean disagreement. It usually has nothing to do with the quality of the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Downvotes usually come from people indicating that "I don't agree with the premise/argument provided by the question". In this scenario, I assume that people are assuming your stance as "yes" and are downvoting as an indication of "no".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand. I'm not yet fully familiar with the way of things around here.
[Offtopic]FYI, in some spanish communities with voting like this where I am, usually the downvote means things like "totally unrelated", "off-topic" or "don't make any sense, delete it", that's why I said that.[/Offtopic]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a confusing system made all the more confusing when equally controversial questions can sometimes just get upvoted because "Hey, this is a useful thing to ask about". I'm glad that this is a learning experience, though, however confounding.


















For starters, we shouldn't just let anyone use any language they want for the tag names. We need to be consistent. Having some series tags in Japanese, and others in English is just confusing. We should strive to make things less confusing, not more. I think we can all agree that being consistent with language use is an easy way to make things less confusing.

Second, I think we can all agree that we should have a primary tag (to be consistent), but also have a synonym in the other language so that users searching for either language can find their questions. Remember, this is all about making things less confusing for the users.

Finally, the language we should use for the primary series tag should be the English name of the series, and the Japanese name should be a synonym. There are two reasons for this, the first being that the official language of Stack Exchange is English. I don't see any reason to use the Japanese name when we're all going to be typing in English. 

The second, more important, reason, is to make things easier for users. Although I'm sure a sizable portion of our beta user base will be familiar with both the Japanese and English names of the series, this isn't going to be true for the community at large. After all, when you first starting watching anime did you have any idea what the Japanese name for any of the series you watched was? Probably not (assuming you're not from Japan). With this in mind, it makes sense that your average user will be searching for the English name, and not the Japanese name. So  going with English just makes more sense. Remember, we want to make things less confusing for users, not more. 

EDIT: In situations where the series doesn't have an English name going with the Japanese one is the obvious (And only) solution. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And for series which don't have an English name, I'd be okay with keeping it romanized Japanese and if it gets and English name, we can always just synonymize that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about shows who's English names are largely unknown, but the romanized Japanese name is dominant? I'd say we need some leeway here. Pick whichever is dominant in the wild.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A good example is *Hana Yori Dango*, where ***both*** titles are fairly well-known to audiences on both sides of the ocean, thanks to the drama serieses in Japan and Korea. Or Full Moon wo Sagashite. Or Yuu Yuu Hakusho, which is sometimes called The Poltergeist Report in the U.S., incorrectly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We should always use the English name when possible to be **consistent**, as I addressed in my post. If we start making exceptions to this rule before long half the questions will be tagged with the english names, and the others the Japanese ones. It'll just be confusing for users./b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would actually argue the opposite. For non-US people (and not just Japanese), the Japanese name is usually more familiar than the English name. I did not even know until recently that Meitantei Conan is known as Case Closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"After all, when you first starting watching anime did you have any idea what the Japanese name for any of the series you watched was?" – ...Yes, mostly because legal anime streaming wasn't a thing at the time, so watching any anime that wasn't currently airing on TV basically meant finding it on the internet, where series often were *only* listed by their Japanese names. :P I agree with the post, though.


















Are "Identify this manga" or "Identify this anime" questions on topic for the site?  I'm wondering if we could incorporate a similar policy as that on https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/13/are-book-movie-tv-series-identification-questions-allowedSciFi.SE.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are "Identify this" questions on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that adopting the SF policy is a good idea.


















Agreeing with @JNat, I think the SF policy is a very good one for a site which has a medium. You may catch a glimpse of an anime or manga somewhere and think it's good, and then try to find it again. Or you may want to reread that one manga you read at a bookstore when you were bored, but you don't remember the name, just the general theme / specific traits about the characters (this is the case for me, currently).

No, they should definitely be off topic.

I wrote a rather huge essay on this topic on Gaming.SE. Rather than re-post it here, I will https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4118/1719just link to that one. All of the points remain the same whether applied to games, anime, movies, etc.

Some of your points are spot-on, but I don't think that they're wildly off-topic here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Answers to IT questions need not be guesses here (which was your biggest complaint in that essay). Anime and Manga are visual formats, and for at least some of the questions the questioner could include or link to a picture of the series in question. I'll also point out that your essay, while it makes good points, is only the third-highest rated answer on the linked question, and anyone reading it should also take the time to read at least a a few of the other opinions there, which also make good points.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Identifying stories are okay in the Sci-Fi stackexchange.  In my point of view anime and manga are closer to stories than to games.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Blue The medium has no bearing on why IT are problematic. SFF and Arqade just have differing site policies.


















I suggest you consider not just holing yourselves into the "one tag per anime/manga" mindset for a number of reasons we learned the hard way in Gaming:


Tag length limit. You'd be surprised how often this comes up. Want to talk about "Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation"? "assassins-creed-3-liberation" is way too long, "assassins-creed-liberation" is 26 characters...
Title localization. Are you going to use "death-note" or "デスノート"? You can accept both, but you need to pick the one that goes in the titlebar — and that's very important Google-wise. So you might decide "okay, let's go with the English title whenever possible because the site is in English." What about animes that lack an official title in English, then?
Lack of character support. Remember what I said about accepting "デスノート" as a tag or at least a tag synonym? Yeah, you can't do that. Yet. UTF-8 support in tags is currently only being tried on https://japanese.meta.stackexchange.com/a/966/2908Japanese.SE, afaik. Sure, it's easy to see a request for enabling this feature here too granted, but you should still be aware that it comes to the price of stability.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/untaggeduntagged. A work that doesn't get two questions asked about it in the same six months gets retroactively changed into https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/untaggeduntagged. If you rely solely on tags to know what anime/manga you're talking about, that... is very bad news. Thanks to Patents.SE and much pressure, Arqade managed to disable this process at the cost of, well, automatically pruning tags that do deserve pruning. That's another "special needs" request you might want to look into, at any rate.


Additionally there are a few ways that would make this even worse for Anime.SE than it is for Arqade:


Questions that are not about a single manga are on-topic. On Arqade questions about games in general are regarded as "game design questions" more appropriate for GameDev. This is not true here and there's already plenty of questions about anime design, reading and production in general. What I've found is that "one tag per game" tends to cannibalize all other forms of tagging (consider for example https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plot-disconnectplot-disconnect, which one could easily consider a poisonous meta-tag that isn't useful as a filter or as an area of experitse.) The thought process that kicks in eventually is that "single work tags" are the superior kind of tag and everything else is useless. You clearly don't want this.
Even when it comes to "single work per tag," you still need to distinguish between anime and manga versions. Except when you don't. Arqade approaches this by using (for example) "mass-effect-series" when asking questions about all Mass Effect canon (as opposed to "mass-effect" which is just about the first game), but such an approach is less likely to work well here. Consider "one-note": is it about the manga, the anime, both?


It is silly to say "don't make tags for single anime/mangas" (you will want tags for all major works - but where do you draw the line?), but going the opposite side and making a tag for all single animes or mangas brings about a lot of challenges, most of which aren't actually fun or rewarding to overcome. You end up wasting time on how to tag "Asaoka High School Baseball Club Diary: Over Fence", cursing about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/untaggeduntagged and generally not spending time actually doing questions and answers.

This is still day one and you still have a chance to break from the tyranny of "one game per tag." I suggest you consider it, starting perhaps by being precise in either the question title or body about what your question is actually about.

It's looking pretty positive though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very valuable point of view: I'm concerned about having many tag for the same series and for the "untagged" issue. On the other hand, the "area of expertise" Wipqozn is talking about is appealing to me.


















I'd go with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scenescene, Scene describes the world of the artwork in question, so it seems best appropriate here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for your input. But, in my opinion, a disadvantage of scene is that it might refer to the graphical artwork. The amount of details, colors, etc.


















Just tag with the name of the manga or anime itself. Experts in that manga or anime will know about its rules inherently. No one is an expert in rules of completely disjoint things in general. That's impossible. People can only be experts on specific subjects. Tag with the subject that the expert would know about, and leave it at that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5People who are interested in the universal laws of different artworks might benefit by such a tag. For example when comparing them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Veger: [tag:tropes], or more specifically [tag:character-abilities]?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mechanicalsnail [tag:character-abilities] is nice, but (obviously) limited to characters.


















I'm inclined against the question being on topic. It is entirely a technical question, and does not involve plots/themes/trivia of the medium at all.

The relevant variables in this question are:


Operating System
Applocale or base locale switching?
Full Japanese OS or just Japanese Language package?
Game platform (which technology base is the Visual Novel using)


... all but the last are utterly irrelevant to this site.

The analogous question to this one over on movies would be "How do I digitize my Betamax movie collection?". Although it's true that movie-buffs are more likely to have an answer, it's also offtopic.

With that said, if we create an 'enhanced FAQ' entry that specifies whether Visual Novel questions themselves are on/offtopic, I think it would be good for that FAQ item to include the answer to this particular question as a snippet.  (I'm also contemplating adding it to the  https://japanese.meta.stackexchange.com/q/756/29resources FAQ over on the Japanese language site.)

EDIT: I think those who support this question as ontopic need to explain whether "I can't play Episode X of anime Y from group Z, help!" is ontopic or not. Or heck, even "Why can't I play Visual Novel X?"  These are just examples of other technical questions that are peripherally related to anime... that anime fans are most likely to have the solutions for.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a reason why a question must have a plots/themes/trivia at all? Is the site really better off if we restrict ourselves to those topics? (I'm not claiming that I have an answer to that question, but just want to throw that around)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KenLi: edited the answer a bit for more examples of the ontopic/offtopic clarity that's needed here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To answer your edit, this is a question of general interest to a fairly broad audience, myself and probably a few others on this site included. This is evidenced by the fact that the question has several upvotes. Any particular question of the form "I can't play Episode X of anime Y from group Z" is likely to be of interest to exactly one person, and is better answered on the site of that particular group. Also, such a question involves illegal activities (fansubbing). There was somewhat of a consensus that we would avoid such topics here on area51. By contrast ITH is perfectly legal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kiruwa "Why can't I play Visual Novel X?" should probably be on-topic, assuming that the question is well-formed and it's something we can answer, and does not involve anything illegal. "I can't play Episode X of anime Y from group Z, help!" should not because the question itself relates to illegal activity. Again, the standard guidelines of SE on what constitutes a good question does apply to all questions, if these questions become very localized then it should be closed as such.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KenLi I still wouldn't like to see "Why can't I play Visual Novel X" because it seems pretty localized. The linked question is good because the answer is applicable to many people. However, I'd have no problem with a question "What troubleshooting steps should I go through when installing/playing Visual Novels." Note that some of these are very much specific to Visual Novels (e.g. I have to change my timezone and date/time display format to get some of them to work, which I don't think I know of any other software like that).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Logan: The decision on where to draw the ontopic/offtopic divide does belong to the community, but treating upvotes as a proxy for topicality is invalid. This has been shown over and over on nearly every StackExchange site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Logan: "What are some troubleshooting steps..." is a fine blogpost, but it's a terrible question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kiruwa I did not say that the upvotes are a proxy for topicality. I said that they are a proxy for interest in the topic. In any case, that was a fairly minor point in my argument.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganMaingi The problem of localized question is outside the realm of scope definition, it's a question of following the SE guidelines.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kiruwa The question of if "What are some trouble shooting steps..." is good question is also in the realm of SE guidelines, not scope. They should be treated on an individual basis whether or not if they are good questions in general.


















I don't see any reason not to allow asking about it, and some questions already have.

However, as a practical matter, fansubs are illegal in most parts of the world. Although this hasn't been tested in court to the best of my knowledge, we're better safe than sorry when it comes to things like that. As such, questions about specific fan translations probably shouldn't be allowed. I think SE policy also requires that we don't advocate or discuss things which are illegal to some degree.

I also don't see any reason to restrict to only those shows that have been translated. Some people here speak Japanese, and anime in its most natural form is in Japanese, so there's no problem asking about shows that haven't yet been translated.

As for tagging, that has a separate meta question here: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/25/should-we-have-one-tag-per-anime-manga-seriesShould we have one tag per Anime/Manga series?. To keep things easy to follow I'd advise you to pose that question there. Note that the SE software does (to the best of my knowledge) support merging tags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, I could ask about the translation nuance *so long as* I didn't reference that the scans/subs were fanmade? Bleach scans occasionally have this problem, for example.


















This question was posted here: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/121/why-do-himura-kenshin-from-rurouni-kenshin-say-gozaru-at-end-of-every-senWhy does Himura Kenshin say ～ござる (~gozaru) at end of every sentence? The author notes that: "I know this question probably belongs more on Japanese.SE, but we need to decide if this type of question is on-topic"

I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other. On the one hand, there are cases (perhaps not this one) where there is some subtlety in the statement that is related to the plot. In that case, Japanese.SE probably wouldn't notice this. On the other hand, just for general questions about Japanese, answers would be faster and more complete there simply because of more people who know Japanese.

I would say, questions regarding the best material to wank off to should be 100% not allowed.  However, discussions regarding some of the other aspects of hentai should be fine.  Some of the highest animation qualities I've ever seen have been in hentai works, and the story-lines of some are surprisingly well thought out.

Of course, this is assuming you're talking about honest-to-god hentai, and not just simple ecchi.  Anime like Gakuen Mokushiroku or Highschool DxD are not hentai.  They're ecchi.  they should be 100% fine here.

Better read as:  Sticking to Canon Questions.

Suppose that an anime has a manga correspondent to it too, and the anime has a fair amount of filler that builds up season after season.  Some fans of the manga whom also watch the anime may not wish to be bothered with all of the filler, and wish to ask for which specific arcs/episodes cover only canonical events with respect to the manga.

A very simple example:  Naruto.  There's lots of filler, even with the second series in it.  Someone that's a fan of the show, but doesn't want to get bogged down by the filler, may want to only watch the episodes that progress the storyline.

Should these sorts of questions be allowed, and if so, under what pretense?

I don't have an objection to allowing these sorts of questions, since it's something that comes up with most long running series.  If we do start allowing them, however, we would need to define what kinds of principles we allow those questions under.  I'm thinking that something like, 'Man this filler really sucks, what's the next arc' questions wouldn't be constructive (and I could be proven wrong!).



EDIT:  To add to the discussion, an idea being bounced around would involve well-defining canon to allow these questions to be answered.  In my mind, the problem is "well-defining" the canon of a series, since some series are anime-only, incomplete in manga, or a mix of both.  Perhaps limiting the scope of these questions to long-running series, with a well-established canon, would help in giving these questions more relevance and less subjectivity.

To the "maintainability" point - I feel that the Community Wiki functionality would be very ideal for this; it allows for flexible maintenance of the list of non-canonical episodes, and everyone can participate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow "I want to skip the filler in series X" questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please add this to the "[What kinds of questions should/shouldn't I ask here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/116/27)" post, to keep things easy to follow. You can edit the answer, it's a CW.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha:  I'd do that but the main contention is we don't know if it's a good or bad question...yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha:  After looking around a bit at some of the more recent questions, I'll be adding this to that CW after all.  The stance certainly seems to have softened a little bit; we'll want to deal with series that don't have well-defined canon as a separate case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it really just about anime vs manga/LN? I imagine people would've liked to ask a question like this for Haruhi Suzumiya (Oh wait...maybe a bad example. LOL) or Kuroko no Basuke. Me personally I skipped some flashback stuff. Or like say Pokemon where some people just wanna see the gym battles.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BCLC: Well, we're not a DVR. It's pretty easy to identify filter if there's already official media to determine if something is canon or not. Only looking at specific _types_ of events (for instance, gym battles in Pokemon), I'd argue that you're on your own for that one.


















Most anime/manga focuses on the story and characters, based on the backdrop of the Universe the story is set in. Fantasy worlds usually come with special rules (the "Physics" of the world) that deviate from the reader's reality (e.g. rules of the Death Note, rules of the Holy Grail War in Fate/Zero, law of "Equivalent Exchange" in Fullmetal Alchemist). Should we encourage questions on the implications and contradictions between the rules?

While the rules may appear consistent enough for the reader to accept the fantasy world and focus on the story, it is natural for readers to peer beyond the surface and question the implications of the rules. However, beyond the surface, the rules often contradict each other and do not form a consistent framework, exemplified by the famous plot-holes in time-travel anime/manga. I think it is pointless to enquire deeper into plot-holes, because probably even the writer of the story doesn't have an answer other than "please focus on the story and appreciate it".

In short, I think questions about rules of the Universe that affect plot events should be encouraged, but not questions about why certain rules contradict and form plot-holes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Inconsistent Rules in Anime/Manga Universesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Somewhat relevant: When answering these questions, I think it's really important for users to cite their information. Since we're talking about fictional worlds with magic/alchemy/whatever, it's harder to tell the difference between an answer based off of a certain scene and an answer based off of whatever the user thinks.


















I would say that questions that are pure definition (ex. asking what the honorific "senpai" means) shouldn't be allowed because they fit better under Japanese.SE, but questions that are purely related to anime or to that anime specifically should be allowed. For example, "What does Kaworu mean in the 24th episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion with his ambiguous phrasing?" should be allowed.

This way, relevant information that can't necessarily be found by just going to something like Google Translate can be asked.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just want to point out that pure definition questions are not allowed on JLU since, well, 1) you can look them up extremely easily 2) we don't really want a question for  every single Japanese word. If there is something particularly tricky/confusing about a word then it's usually OK though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks. I haven't looked at JLU, but I was thinking of it as more like a "what people would you refer to people with senpai" when I wrote that, which, now that I looked at it, is not at all what I wrote.


















My biggest problem with this question isn't so much in the question itself, but in the wording. "Filler content" is a slightly ambiguous term. For instance, many manga have extra chapters that get animated but aren't related to the plot of the story. It's not clear whether or not these should count as filler.

I'd suggest that these sorts of questions are better phrased as comparisons between the anime and the source material, e.g. "Which Naruto episodes are not based on content from the manga?" As far as I know filler content is almost never added for anime-original series, so this doesn't seem terribly restrictive.

However, I do worry that the site could become overrun by these sorts of questions. As such, it seems better to limit this to long-running series with lots of filler content. The other thing that worries me about this is that for ongoing shows the answer will change every time more filler is produced. I don't really know how to deal with this, since the answer will need to be edited every time, which will result either in frequent bumps or the answer quickly becoming obsolete. I don't know of a good solution for this, since restricting to completed shows rules out most of the big ones like One Piece, Naruto, Detective Conan, etc.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. I think you listed enough reasons to say no. :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not opposed to your suggestion, as this does help keep the site from being overrun from these sorts of questions.


















The main motivation here is https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/156/20this question asking where to find a list of currently airing anime, including date and time. It can be seen as a polling question (well, really, it is) and might come a cross as subjective, as there may be multiple valid answers, of which you might choose one by preference, but I also think it has (an) objectively correct answer(s), which fulfills the criteria set forth in the question completely.

What should or policy be here? Close as off-topic / not constructive (polling)? Keep them if they have one or more definite answers, from which one might pick depending on ones preferences?

As a tangent, on SO, there may also be multiple solutions to a specific programming problem, and you pick one that fits best depending on your demands and / or preferences.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow "where can I find X info / resource about anime / manga"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the long-run, these will probably degenerate into the same "not-constructive" category as many of the historically locked questions on SO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/170/20) is another candidate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wanted to vote to close because it didn't seem constructive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with Mysticial. Talking about "anime list" sites i.e., even the most balanced question about pro and cons of MyAnimeList vs. AnimePlanet will easily degenerate in not-constructive answers and will be consequently locked.


















In the beginning, these type of https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31253/the-bike-shed-problem-and-sobike-shed questions may be very attractive to many new users joining the site. They are common questions that many people will be searching for and will ultimately bring them to the site.

However, in the long-run, as we have seen on https://stackoverflow.com/Stackoverflow, they tend to degenerate into the large-scale non-constructive polling questions - which are no longer allowed and ended in many of the existing ones in a historical lock.



So I think it's a double-edged sword. In the short-run they may be useful (or even crucial) to bringing in a critical mass of users. But in the long-run they will probably harm the site.

If we wanted to get the best of both, we could allow them for now. But if and when the site reaches maturity, we may need to consider locking them down - just as what has happened on Stackoverflow.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. So, let us keep them alive in the short run. There is a lot of time to curb them if they start outgrowing their usefulness, no need to battle them from day one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Crazy. I was with you until the *"they may crucial to bring in users"* bit. Puhleeze... This site will have no trouble attracting an early audience. The worst thing that can happen here is drive towards *"we'll worry about quality later."* A new site is evaluated for having a strong start with quality content,  much much much much much much more so than having the largest possible audience. If these questions will harm the site long-term, don't allow them. You're here to build a strong foundation now... **for the long run.** Don't fall for these games just to pump up your numbers — bad idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RobertCartaino Fair enough. So I take it that by your evaluation, this site is already doing better than average compared to other private betas?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No.  You don't make rules at point A, and then change them at point B.  We make a ruleset, and stick with it.  Rules may change with time, but that should be part of the growing and refining process, not done to make exceptions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert If you had to pick from: 1) Changing the rules midway. 2) Site fails due to inactivity. Which would you pick? I would certainly pick 1. This is why I made this suggestion. But given that Robert said "This site will have no trouble attracting an early audience.", I can only assume that we are already doing much better than average - so as to be not even at risk of closing down like so many betas have already.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we have to resort to changing rules to pull in a userbase, the site deserves to die.  Because it will as soon as we change the rules to what we really want.  People would be right in saying we sold them a false bill of goods.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert That's a fair enough viewpoint. But it's not like it hasn't happened before with some of the bigger sites.


















I think we could do something like https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1482/what-are-your-favorite-english-language-toolsthis - create "resource posts" that become centralized, single-instance posts of given kind of lists.

Allow them for now - another week maybe. Gather the answers, vote them according to quality. Then close, protect, archive and refer people to the archived question in years to come. The validity of the answers mutates very slowly. It will be okay for a few years, when we may conditionally allow one with updates.

Of course much more narrow and specific questions about resources - ones that are bound to yield 2-3 answers max, should be still welcome. Something so broad - maybe one or three per site is enough to cover all needs.

Just as another example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Xeo It's worth noting that our book question is the *only* one of the highly upvoted ones that survived the deletion-audit back in March. And we fought hard for it too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In other words, it takes a lot of maintenance and some pretty heavy-handed moderation to keep it from degenerating.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should difficulty of maintenance override usefulness of a resource?

"Let's kill it early, will save us work later, and usefulness be damned."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF: It's not lazyness, it's a crap bunch of work to keep those lists up-to-date and clear of spam / low-quality content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think @Mysticial is saying it's a case of cost/benefit -- the benefit ("usefulness") might be there, but it's at an extraordinary cost to the community, mods, and top users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kasuchiko: Are you sure the cost is so extraordinary? We can always close and/or delete the questions if they become unmaintainable. Meanwhile, the number of answers alone says the demand is pretty high, and it takes a long time for such a list even completely unmaintained to decline in usefulness through link rot to something -worse- than *no list at all*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the price of maintenance is incredibly high, and this is a *known* cost. Frankly, this is a question that is easily googled and of the type that this platform simply doesn't handle well. Let a blog / Tumblr post be the de facto resource; it doesn't have to be us here. Frankly, it *shouldn't* be us here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Kasuchiko: I think I can agree to that: Go one meta level up. We don't provide lists of resources. We allow just one link to a site that maintains such a list. This way users are still satisfied and the cost of maintaining one link is quite acceptable.


















For example fullmetal alchemist, code geass and numerous other animes have different series, should we minimize the tags and just use the standard one and use synonyms or should tags exist for each of the series?

Personally I think the standard tag with synonyms will work the best, thoughts?

Since just "ending" can have both meanings, we should differentiate questions about the actual anime ending (maybe tag with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plotplot?) and the ending song / theme / ED (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ending-songending-song?).

What should the tags be?

I think it would be better to use a tag that represents both the intro and outro songs, maybe something along the lines of "theme song", then the OP can describe which one or both they are referring to.

This may not be as straightforward as it looks. 

In one way, just making synonyms is ok. This, as you mentioned, will help to group up questions instead of splitting them to 100 different tags. For example, Code Geass R2 can effectively be a synonym of Code Geass (I see no problems with this; if anyone does, please tell me).

On the other hand, this definitely can not be used blindly for each and every series. 
For example, we have FMA and FMA:Brotherhood. Making them synonyms would be (in my opinion) a huge mistake, since the series' stories are just different, and it's even possible that the same question can be answered differently depending on whether it is related to FMA or FMA:Brotherhood. 

So I would say that if the suggested synonym can not possible confuse the question-posters and the answerers, it's acceptable. But should rather be handled manually for each specific tag, because there's really no rule of thumb here.

No. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spoilerspoiler is a meta tag. It doesn't describe the content of the question, but the question itself. It didn't indicate what the question is about, it indicates what might be inside.

I've started to retag some questions and primarily removing anime and manga tags from some questions otherwise we'll have too many questions tagged with manga and anime.

When I know for a fact that the question is valid for both the manga and anime I'll remove the tag.

These tags should essentially be used when the question is specific enough and aimed to either the manga or anime of a series.

I think we should include a faq on how to use the spoiler markup in the faq or somewhere more accessible for new users, as anime contains a lot of spoilers and many new users don't use the advanced help link when creating a question.

Just looking for a better way to inform users about the markup, otherwise this will be the main job for moderaters, implementing spoiler markup for questions by new users.

Suggestions?

I think the format you suggested is quite good, the genre and main character(s) is important, but I will also like to suggest including the theme or plot direction, something like:

  brothers; Edward and Alphonse Elric, who through a series of events
  studies and uses alchemy in their search for the legendary
  philosopher's stone.

We really need to agree on this one early on. What do we do with questions who by nature are spoilers? I mean, not part of the question, but the entire question.

For instance, asking about a character who's identity is only revealed later in the manga (but not the anime). Even the question's title itself may contain major spoilers in that case.

The source of the problem comes from the unique relationship between manga and anime. The manga would always be ahead of the anime, and there would always be people only viewing one of the two.

Therefore, questions on topics entirely revealed on the manga is likely to produce heavy spoilers for viewers of the anime.

How do we deal with those? The only way I can think of is implement a feature to mark an entire question as spoilerish.

I don't see filler content as ambiguous; Makoto gave a pretty good definition in the question.


  Some fans of the manga whom also watch the anime may not wish to be bothered with all of the filler, and wish to ask for which specific arcs/episodes cover only canonical events with respect to the manga.


To make it a bit more formal, if we strictly define filler as "Things in are decidedly not canon, as created by the original author or production company.", then this is very objective and very answerable. See Ktash's comments for more details and examples this criterion. I do not see a reason to restrict questions of this type.

I do not see the site being overrun by questions like this, since a question of this nature could be asked at most once per series. Gaming.SE, for example, deals with questions of this nature all the time (that can exist once per game, but are largely the same each time just with the game title changed), and it hardly ruins the ratio of content on the site there.

It won't get asked about every anime, and the ones it does get asked for will get quality useful content. I think this is a huge bonus for the site, actually. One of the main things that's important for a StackExchange site is to have content that will draw users in. People will search Google all the time to figure out which episodes of their favorite anime to skip. If Anime.SE can answer that question, maybe they'll stick around and ask/answer other questions as well.

I think this is a popular question, not terribly difficult to answer, not terribly difficult to maintain (since filler tends to happen in arcs and not usually in one-off scenarios). Gaming.SE also has to deal with maintainability issues (Minecraft in particular gets updated all the time, outdating scores of answers), and an occasional bump as a new plot arc starts every few months isn't going to ruin the front page.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Except that this definition won't always work as not all series derive from manga, and even those that do sometimes contain canonical story/events that were not shown in the manga. Two good examples of this are FLCL which became a manga after the fact, and Trigun, which started as an incomplete manga where the anime filled in some of the story gaps.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ktash That's why it's not a good idea to make blanket rules. We should apply logic to each individual case. For Naruto and Bleach, my restrictions make sense, and disallowing a question about those series doesn't. For FLCL or Trigun, questions about filler are subjective and should be closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't agree that questions about filler for those shows are "subjective" or should be closed. There is still a true answer about what is filler and what is not. I would just change the definition to be stories created by the original author, or production company, or those approved by said parties as canon material. In Naruto's case, the author has acknowledged that anime filler in Naruto is non-canon (as seen numerous times by when the anime does something that the manga contradicts later).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ktash I will amend my answer. That's a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Honestly, such questions might attract attention yes. But it's not like we need to attract *just any kind of attention*. I prefer less visits but a much better site than lots of visits and tons of "what are the fillers for X?" questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno:  So it seems then that we should narrow the scope of these types of questions.  I've added some more points to my original question up above.


















I think a good rule of thumb is this:


Make sure the title of the question is NOT inherently spoilery. (One of https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/4/aarthithe moderators has https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19/do-we-know-what-happens-to-spike-at-the-end-of-cowboy-bebop#comment48_19already https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/12/list-of-surviving-uchiha#comment47_12requested this on the site a couple of times.) 
Warn for spoilers in the first line or two of the post.
Mark the main part of the question inside spoiler block quotes ( which is > ! for those unaware)
Try to include some non-spoilery background to make the question discoverable long term.


A good example is https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/16517/where-is-stark-tower-locatedWhere is Stark Tower located? on SciFi. There's some background to make the question discoverable, but the main part of the question (which is spoilery for The Avengers film) is hidden under spoiler tags.

I strongly disagree to banish this kind of interesting and smart questions from Anime & Manga. At a question like that, the right answer is to back in topic by listing software used in a specific anime as an example. I'm thinking about Hoshi no Koe, the first self-producted anime by Makoto Shinkai: in the booklet, software he used back in early 2000 are listed: Photoshop 5 (2D), Lightwave 6.5 (CGI), Commotion DV3, Adobe After Effects 4.0. Is this information irrelevant? Are question about techniques a taboo?

At least IMOb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agree, in-depth talk about a specific tool are off-topic. It's about seeing the difference about "hey, I want to make an anime, what software I can use?" (off-topic) and "What software Makoto Shinkai used in his first self-made movie?" (ok), as I replied in [this meta question](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/167/98) about creation processes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat See my comment on http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4/244 and on OP. This should be about *real knowledge* of *Japanese* production ***internals***. This must *nothing* to do with "may AE be good for" and that kind of speculation. ***Speculation is bad.*** *Speculation* **is** what *makes* these *'off-topic'*. The question must be *focused tightly* on the **knowledge** of how Japanese **actually** make anime. (**Not** on how they might.). And then it is *on-topic*, and *only* on topic **here**.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@naxa Yes, you make some very good points. I agree with your point of view.


















I think this is a horrible idea.  I can all-but-guarantee you it will become the most-overused and abused tags on the site.


  Questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime
  This tag indicates that the question is specific to the anime version of a series that exists as both anime and manga, or movie(s).


I get that some questions are about an anime-specific version of the work —  so describe that in your question; not with tags. Otherwise, we'd have a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/moviemovie tag on our Movie & TV site used only for movies that just happen to have TV versions. Sound silly, doesn't it? 

Users are never going to understand that an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime tag is only for questions that are specific to the anime-version of a series that exists as both anime and manga. Users are going to try and use this for every question that is either anime or menga.

But your can't divide a site into large swaths like this. These discussions go back as far back as our Cooking site when some folks were only interested in "savory vs. sweet" while another wanted "vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian."  The tags will convey no useful information. At best it will be a horribly incomplete categorization system.

I don't think you should have these tags at all.

As you've already seen, users will continue to use these tags in lieu of good tagging practices. They're too general, which is why we typically block them on the outset… to say "no, no... what is your question really about?" 

I understand that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mengamenga and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime were never designed to be general, catch-all tags… but that's how they are going to be used. Users are never going to understand that an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mengamenga tag is only for questions that are specific to the anime-version of a series that exists as both anime and manga. So those tags will applied to a completely random assortment of questions without reason. 

If you have a question that is about an anime-specific version of the work, describe that in your question; not with tags. You don't need tags to narrow down your question to that degree. It's too confusing and misleading to the vast, vast majority of your users, and I can all-but-guarantee you it will become the most-overused and abused tags on the site.

EDIT: No.

Having considered this a bit... I actually don't think we should have a tag for this.


It serves no purpose. No one is going to follow it, or ignore it. It only makes sense as a subtag of a particular series, and it's long established on SE that such tags are a BAD thing
It's either redundant with the title (bad), or replacing it (worse: "When Sai leaves. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hikaru-no-gohikaru-no-go https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variationsvariations").
Fundamentally... it's a meta-tag seperating out a certain kind of QUESTION, rather than categorizing it by the OBJECT of the question. It seems like it separates around the object, but that would only be if we had tags like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hikaru-no-go-variationshikaru-no-go-variations, rather than this meta-tag bolted onto the side of the other tag.

And, imo, that is redundant.


















Sure, I'm thinking of something like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-anime-differencesmanga-anime-differences or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-anime-variationsmanga-anime-variations. Go wild. I think it's a perfectly valid tag.

I think we should allow them. Even if you can find the answer on another site, we want people to come here. By asking these questions here (and providing answers), we are potentially drawing more visitors to the site when they Google the same question which in turn leads to more views and possibly more members if they like the site so much.

These questions should be within reason, though. For example, simply asking "Who is the author of Bleach?" is not a very good question and should not be encouraged just because we allow questions that you can answer with some Googling.

If we agree that they are poor questions, then what is the disagreement?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree that they should be closed, or deemed off-topic (which is what I thought you meant in your last paragraph). Too simple is a down vote reason, not a close reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wipqozn I never said if they should be closed, deemed off-topic, or down voted. I just mean we shouldn't encourage these just because we say it's OK to ask things that you could find on Google.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My mistake then. Your last sentence really sounded to me like you thought these questions should be closed, and were suggesting as such.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wipqozn I've edited my post to clarify the second paragraphb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wipqozn Whether they should be closed depends on the Site's decision.

It seem a "too difficult" exclusion to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chirale I think only one person argued that it was too difficult for us since we aren't lawyers. Others just thought it was off topic rather than too difficult.


















This is https://anime.stackexchange.com/Anime and Manga, a Q&A site regarding Japanese anime and manga.

Good questions are


Questions which can be answered with facts, or plot items which were already confirmed.
Questions which directly ask about a specific manga and/or anime.
Questions which directly ask about anime and/or manga in general.
Questions which directly ask about canonical events in a specific anime and/or manga.


Bad questions are


Questions about future events. They cannot be correctly answered, and they end up as one of two cases:


Either the future event never happens, and the question remains unanswered.
Or the event happens, and then the question is obsolete.

Questions which would end up soliciting debate:


"Who would win? X or Y?"
"Which anime is better? X or Y?"

Questions which don't ask directly about any sort of anime/manga, or anime/manga in general.
Questions that can only be answered by assuptions not supported with any facts, e.g.:


If Spike from Cowboy Bebop had Sharingan, would the anime have ended differently?

And if it is not yet (clearly) confirmed/known it still might result in debate


















Questions that ask for resources are dangerous, since you don't have a definite answer or a range of definite answers: you'll receive tons of answers that can be considered all equally "right".

The factor that makes you decide which one is the best is subjective. I might like a different resource rather than yours.

This is not my opinion, rather it's a long established SE policy, so there's not much we can really do.

In any case, I'm not totally against these questions, but I would advise to forbid them on the main site. Instead, let's move them to Meta and make a single resources question so we can use that for these things.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We had a small discussion about this [in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/7247252#7247252) (just for context).


















Absolutely not.

I've been a longtime lurker on the Stack Exchange sites (notably, SciFi) and I can say that these types of questions are always not constructive. 

The Not Constructive "off-topic" close reason has the following text appended to it:


  As it currently stands, this question is not a good fit for our Q&A format. We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or specific expertise, but this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion. If you feel that this question can be improved and possibly reopened, see the FAQ for guidance.


Questions that ask for anime recommendations are:


Not empirically answerable. -- They don't have one, or even finite, correct answers.
They're flamewar bait. -- People will get into comment-fights about which anime is better, which is the better recommendation, why someone's rec was wrong, etc. I don't want to see that kind of drama here.
They're usually polls. -- A non-terminating list of answers that get votes by popularity? Classic poll. Plus, mainstream titles (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece) are going to get more attention than less mainstream / niche shoujo or seinen/josei titles (Sainkoku Monogatari). 
They're an excuse for discussion. -- Good recommendations will require extensive knowledge about the OP's tastes and likes/dislikes. This is better done in chat.


Basically: always close these questions as Not Constructive "off-topic" and hold these discussions in chat instead.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5point taken, as other members suggested a separate room for anime recommendations will do the trickb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These are my thoughts aswell, and with the added fact that we can have a dedicated chatroom *and* that there are many sites out there which specifically offer this, I'd count them as not constructive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rather than Not Constructive, I'd consider adding a rule in the FAQ that disallows asking list/catalog style questions, which would then make these questions Off Topic, which makes it clearer to the community that they're disallowed (see reasoning [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/27/what-do-we-do-with-questions-about-future-events-releases/43#comment83_43)).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FAE No need for that. They're already a no-no. Adding them to the FAQ would just steal space from more site-peculiar things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Xeo I think it's safe to say this is what the community thinks. I'd add a status-completed but I'm not a mod here. :D

It seems that there are already some duplicate tags, such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ruroni-kenshinruroni-kenshin and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rurouni-kenshinrurouni-kenshin (and another one just by the name of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kenshinkenshin). How should we act regarding different romanizations of the Japanese titles? I'm thinking that the first one should be suppressed, and everything tagged with it retagged with the second tag. Or maybe different spellings are allowed and synonyms created?

Also, there are some like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variationsvariations and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/comparison-of-mediacomparison-of-media. Should these be linked somehow? Or one of them suppressed?

If we make the first a synonym of the second, it will at all places be replaced with that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ok, I am new to the whole tagging thing


















Considering that accents are not allowed in tags, I would say that we should use the non-accented romanized spelling for titles. Rurōni Kenshin with one "o" is only appropriate because of the use of Hepburn-style romanization using the macron for the long vowel. Rurouni Kenshin is the most correct form that we can use in the tagging system, so I think we should default to that. 

Regarding https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kenshinkenshin or any other common shortenings for series names (for example, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evaeva for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gitsgits for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ghost-in-the-shellghost-in-the-shell), we should synonimize them with the proper titles.

But still, I think the question should be retagged.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat I agree, it should be retagged to the series in that case rather than the character.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5apparently i was already tagged as [tag:rurouni-kenshin] too. So I removed the [tag:kenshin] tag and put the [tag:characters] tag instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I prefer the longer version for those tags, actually...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno That's what I meant, synonimize the short versions to the long form, proper titles.


















I think that I will cite Madare Uchiha's response to this question: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/13/are-live-action-series-based-on-anime-manga-light-novels-on-topic-hereAre live-action series based on anime/manga/light novels on topic here?. I think that only anime and manga should be discussed on this site, though questions about comparisons between light novels and their corresponding anime/manga, for example, should be allowed. That draws a pretty solid line.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is there about Manga that makes light novels not be suitable? Same goes for visual novels. They're all very closely related Japanese media, so I don't think we should keep half of it out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 - We already *have* a site for VNs and similar, and that's Arqade. There's also the fact that they are produced outside of Japan, while anime isn't.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MartinSojka: Eh, they originate from Japan and are vastly more popular there than anywhere else. Also, I don't think that VNs quite fit to Arqade. And even if we leave VNs out, what about light novels?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Xeo: There already *are* VN questions on Arqade, and though they aren't common, they're still welcome there. An example would be [Analogue: A Hate Story](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/82018/what-is-the-full-list-of-log-entries-in-analogue-a-hate-story), which also happens to be created by a Canadian, [Christina Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Love_%28visual_novelist%29).


















I know that for some shows, there are differences between American and Japanese versions of animes (and probably mangas as well). One of the clearest examples of this is the change in relation between people in the American version of Sailor Moon. Sometimes, the name is different (Cardcaptor Sakura vs. Cardcaptors) but not always. Should there be a tag to specify that a question is specifically asking about the American version?

I know a similar question was asking in this post: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/108/a-tag-for-differences-between-versionsA tag for differences between versions. That only talks about variations, though, and I wanted to specifically address changed American versions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should there be a tag to differentiate American vs. Japanese versions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A better example would be *Go Lion* vs Voltron.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or Robotech vs Macross (and the other series that were rolled into Robotech.


















(Shog9 http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/7248274#7248274said in chat that such tag rename requests should be made in meta, so here's the first one)

...I don't know what else to say though. All official sources (both English and Japanese) show that the title is two words, not three. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename tag "full-metal-alchemist" to "fullmetal-alchemist"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's my fault, sorry, I posted the first question about it, and everybody just used my tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Danalog Not blaming anyone, I just think it's best to fix this now rather than when there are a lot more questions and users. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. I just finished editing an answer to a question related to Fullmetal Alchemist and changed a few occurrences of "Full Metal" to "Fullmetal", as the latter is the correct combination of those two words for the official English title.


















In theory, most questions on here will be about plot. I think it will be noise we don't need. It also doesn't serve to describe what the question is about any better. So, while I don't think it is necessarily meta, I think it is unnecessary.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree.  [tag:anime] and [tag:manga] serve to determine which you are talking about.  For [tag:plot], there's not really a "no-plot" tag you could add to give more insight into a question either way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5agreed, I started to remove the plot tag from questions


















The "fatezero" tag is for the Fate/Zero series. Fate/stay night is already rendered as fate-stay-night and I agree that the slash should be replaced by a dash instead of just mushing the two words together.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename tag "fatezero" to "fate-zero"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about a synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@looper, we should follow the same politics for multi-word tags across all tags. If we decide they are "word-word-word" (like on the other SE sites), then they _all_ should be named this way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I created that tag by mistake - it was a slip of the finger. Is there any way to change it? I agree that "fate-zero" would be better.


















https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/q/8367/70919Original Question on Area51
Background Info
VOCALOID (ボクロイド) is an English and Japanese (and recently Spanish, Chinese and Korean) voice synthesizer. The anime-inspired characters come with a 'voice' included in the software, which allows them to sing diverse songs created by anyone, with no limits to the pitch or tone of the singer's voice. Hatsune Miku (初音ミク CV01), the most well-known Vocaloid - hitting Japan by storm in earlier years - has even made her way to the Top 50 Music Charts in Japan. She has released over 100,000 songs in her short life with countless different producers. It has evolved so much, that 2-hour-long concerts have been showed in Japan, America and England, as well as several other countries with the character projected onto a screen or using holographic imagery. On http://nicovideo.jpNico Nico Douga, a popular Japanese version of YouTube (if you will) artists have made MVs (music videos) and PVs (picture videos) as well as MMD (MikuMikuDance - another software developed because of VOCALOID) videos, which as an animation - usually dancing and singing. Also in YouTube,  many people have watched the PVs and MMD videos, and over 18,000,000 views have been counted on the http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTXO7KGHtjIlive version of Hatsune Miku's World is Mine (ワールドイズマイン) song. On http://fanfiction.netFanfiction.net, a dedicated category was opened for the use of writing about the VOCALOIDs and many have been written. Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin/Len and Megurine Luka - from Crypton Future Media - will all be apart of the Vocaloid 3 collection using the latest YAMAHA software, and Hatsune Miku will also have an English voicebank. Luka, Rin and Len's V2 versions already have English compatibility. Other VOCALOIDs include:
From the V1 series

Meiko (Japanese)
Kaito (Japanese)
Miriam (English)
Leon (English)
Lola (English)

From the V2 series

Hatsune Miku CVO1 (初音ミク CV01) (Japanese)
Kagamine Rin/Len CVO2 (鏡音リン・レン CV02) (Japanese)
Megurine Luka CV03 (巡音ルカ CV03) (Japanese)
Sweet Ann (English)
Prima (English)
Plus +18 more

From the V3 series

SeeU (시유) (Korean)
Oliver (English)
IA (Japanese)
Bruno (Spanish)
Clara (Spanish)
+13 more and more to come (including CV01, CV02 and CV03 Vocaloid3 releases)

Topic
Because of the fact the characters are 'anime', they are Japanese (mostly), and MV with anime art in them that could be considered a movie with the subtitles/lyrics. Some series have 8+ songs in them with about 8 minutes length such as the 'Akuno(悪ノ)(Evil Of) Series'.
Would the new Anime and Manga site be open to questions related to this? For example:

Q1: VOCALOID: In Servant of Evil (悪ノ召使) by Kagamine Len, why is Rin holding a glass flask at the end of the PV?
Q2: VOCALOID: Are Kagamine Rin and Len officially twins?
Q3: VOCALOID: Who is Hatsune Miku's Voice actress?

Cheers.

I suppose I should add it back?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial Who edited it out? Well, let's wait until we all agree first. :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/27/revisionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial Ah I see, but you used "disconnect", right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not that it matters since I wasn't expecting the exact names to be static while we're still in private beta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I originally used "plot-details" on my first question, but it was edited down to just "plot" shortly (and now it's gone completely, leaving only the series tag). The two tags suggested here sound good to me.


















Keeping with the little note about http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/"The Seven Essential Meta Questions of Every Beta", I thought I'd open the discussion about the graphical interface of our lovely anime/manga site!



As our site approaches graduation, we were asked to help with ideas regarding the design of our site..

So, I suppose anyone with suggestions should post them on up! I'm sure the whole community would love to see all of your creations!

Ideas, art pieces, thoughts, or anything else would be welcomed :)

Keep in mind that while bits and pieces are alright, we should grasp the big picture of how we want the site before we knitpick the details.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our site design look like?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Quick mockup from chat.. but we would need some more lolis.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PmrwQ.png).


















Questions related to the use of the software fit very nicely on the https://video.stackexchange.com/Audio-Video Production SE site.

Works produced with the help of the software are fit for this site if they are anime works - that is generally, animated videos produced in Japan or by a Japanese company or individuals. Border cases will exist, but those are to be determined by further "Is this anime?" questions on our meta. In such a case, there's no point in singling out that they are VOCALOID-related questions. The site deals primarily with the end products, not with the tools used to create them.

Non-anime works created using this software are off-topic here, though they may be on-topic for Movies and TV (when used in life-action or non-anime animated works), Arqade (when used for computer game voices), Science Fiction and Fantasy (for non-anime works from these genres using the voices) and similar content-related SE sites.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder if this kind of standard would become increasingly confusing as Vocaloid works become manga/anime/light novels. "Kagerou Days", an arguably SciFi Vocaloid video (time travel is involved), already has a manga and LN, and an anime is in the works. If I want to ask something about the original video, do I need to go to SciFi&Fantasy?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza: If you want to ask something about *just* that one (and not in the context of all related media), you can do so on SF&F. Not having seen it though, if it *also* qualifies as an anime, it has space to be asked here also - some overlap is inevitable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza My understanding is that a question about the original video, if it is deemed acceptable here, would probably be because it is part of the essence of "Kagerou Days" moreso than that it is because of it being VOCALOID. If that makes any sense.


















First of all, I think it's too early to discuss this. The site will only receive it's unique design when it finishes the beta. I think this should wait a couple of days, at least until the open beta starts so more users can vote/share their opinions. 

As for what I would like it to look like, a drawn-style, something like there is on http://programmers.stackexchange.comhttp://programmers.stackexchange.com is nice, it should be more anime-like style of drawing though. 
Programmers.SE looks like the interface is drawn with a marker, that is not going to suit this site.

I also really like the design of area51. It's not even about the pictures or the interface layout, but rather about the fact that it's bursting with colors, and looks very good. For example, if you compare Area51 and Stackoverflow, you will see that SO looks plain and dull (that's my personal opinion). Since we are discussing anime here, not some serious stuff like physics, I think that the site should be bright and colorful (much like anime itself is).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, I draw -- so I'll be happy enough to contribute something to this site (when we get to that point, of course!)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Speaking as a community coordinator for Stack Exchange, I don't think it's too early because of the process timing. You might consider it early in the sense that as a community, we all barely know each other. But no matter the time until graduation, every bit of work done to help confirm a site design is extremely helpful for us to actually create that design when the time comes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Grace, thanks, that's some important feedback ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GraceNote thanks or your support. I think you may or may not be the only one who understood my reasons or posting the question :)


















Performed a simple rename for this. Did not elect to setup a synonym yet, but in this case it's not unreasonable. I imagine the most of people will use Fullmetal but it's feasible to expect someone (especially someone brand new) might look up for Full Metal.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Shouldn't need a synonym - IIRC, if you try to create a tag that differs from an existing tag only by dashes, it'll be blocked.


















I think we have to ask the question: Do these characters exist in any Anime or Manga?, and answer accordingly based on that, referring to material outside of the anime/manga if it's needed to better answer the question.

An appropriate Western animation analogy would be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izzy_%28mascot%29Izzy, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics mascot -- questions about Izzy or olympic mascots in general would be inappropriate, but questions about the one-shot animated special Izzy's Quest for Olympic Gold would be fair game, and questions about Izzy's design within the special could then use information about Izzy in general in order to answer the question. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do agree - however, in the description I stated that they have 'music videos' that I myself usually call anime. Since they are: A) Japanese, B) Animated using the Japanese-styled drawings C) Are shown in a video format. I suppose the question I'm asking you is, **what is considered Anime & Manga?**


















Not sure if this deserves a whole answer, but...

It would be cool if we could have an anime-style mascot. Kind of like Wikipedia's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aWikipe-tanWikipe-tan or the various http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-tanOS-tan characters.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5although I think that would be nice, I'm not sure that (given the amount of different genres inside anime and manga) we could find a mascot that would please all of the community. But then again, we could propose some mascots and have a voting!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat You're never going to find something that pleases EVERYONE, lol. I think a lot of the design should probably be based off of SE's overall design though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe there should be a contest (I don't know how it usually goes down in other SE sites). Both for the overall site design and for a mascot. But a long time from now still... lolb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat All things said, considering Wikipedia managed to get a mascot of its own and it represents a whole larger encompassing sphere of things, I don't think it's hard to imagine something can develop for ourselves.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the idea of a mascot ! :)


















There are many questions which can't be answered easily, because there's just no known answer (mostly regarding story, abilities or something like that). Some examples:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/304/is-it-possible-to-combine-all-five-chakra-elementsIs it possible to combine all five chakra elements?

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-did-hashiramas-and-madaras-statues-at-the-valley-of-the-end-came-to-beHow did the Hashirama and Madara statues at the Valley of the End come to be?

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13/what-is-the-significance-of-rans-birthdayWhat is the significance of Ran's birthday?

I think that these questions just can't be answered, they just provoke a discussion, because the true answer isn't known.

I think we should state in the FAQ, that such questions aren't allowed, because normally, this doesn't fit to the Q&A-Format of SE. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we explicitly allow discussions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this sort of question is allowed in [SF.se](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, and they write it in the FAQ, we shouldn't forget that :D.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions specifically setting up discussion are the *opposite* of what SE was built to handle. If this site rules to allow questions like that, there is a good chance that Jeff's replacement will come in here and nuke them from orbit anyway. We are given some level of freedom, but there are still basic tenets that we have to abide by.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, I don't really see why the question itself was downvoted... It is already showing itself as a problem so I think it is a valid meta post, regardless of your opinion on whether or not it should be allowed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza Votes on meta can also show agreement. Personally, I down voted since the questions show a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Stack Exchange network is. With that in mind, I don't feel it is a very useful discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wipqozn Yes, I agree with you, but we have discussion questions so obviously it is a problem that needs to be addressed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question itself doesn't have to be downvoted. All that he/she has done is pasted links to questions which were presumed to be violating the SE rules. The asker has a clear understanding of the rules, and the question only asks how the rule should be applied in specific cases.


















As Martin Sojka suggested, I agree that questions about using the Vocaloid program do not belong here.

However, besides the fact that Vocaloids are part of otaku culture, they are also starting to see their share of mangahttp://myanimelist.net/manga/26196/Aku_no_Meshitsukai[1]http://myanimelist.net/manga/11128/Miku-4[2]http://myanimelist.net/manga/3446/Maker_Hikoushiki_Hatsune_Mix[3] and soon even a full-length TV animehttp://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=476733[1]. These are just "official" examples, but I have no doubt that even more doujin examples exist. I believe Vocaloid works in themselves are simply another form of doujin works, and questions related to their plots, stories, characters, etc. should be allowed here.

Allowed:


Why does time keep resetting in Kagerou Days?
How are Hatsune Miku and Akita Neru related?
Has it ever been officially stated which Kagamine twin is older?


Not allowed:


How can I make the Vocaloid program make this kind of sound?
Where can I download Vocaloid CDs for free? (for legal reasons)
Which Vocaloid sings this song? (allowing these could open up the possibility of thousands of questions just asking the same thing for different songs; it is probably better suited for chat)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like your answer and have chosen it to be accepted because you've shown your knowledge in the Vocaloid songs and videos, provided questions which may be deemed relevant and irrelevant - and also have provided good links to evidence of the 'anime' facade of it. Congrats and thanks ^o^



















I think that these questions just can't be answered, they just provoke a discussion, because the true answer isn't known.

Try hard to differentiate here between:

Questions that cannot be answered (because, for instance, they're asking folks to predict the future or are based on an under-specified and/or completely hypothetical scenario). These should generally just be shut down - discussing them produces nothing but speculation.

Questions where the answer is obscure or difficult to obtain (relies on knowledge in an author's private journal, protected by a non-disclosure agreement, guarded by a dragon). These can be ok, if folks are disciplined about not answering when they don't have access to information. If they degenerate into idle speculation, they should be shut down as with #1.

Questions where the answer is irrelevant and the asker simply wants to get to know other members of the site better by getting folks to post their feelings (this is often the actual case for instances of #1 and #2, but some questions are explicitly asked for this reason). These should generally be shut down - they are discussion for the sake of discussion, and there are http://chat.stackexchange.com/other venues more appropriate for this.


The fact is, this is a Q&A website - which means http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/for every Question, there must be an Answer. Folks visiting a year from now aren't going to care about some impromptu fan-fiction you and someone else put together in lieu of an actual answer - if they're searching for a question here to satisfy their curiousity or settle an argument, they're gonna want something substantial, and if we can't offer that we're just wasting their time.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/faq#dontaskThe FAQ states this pretty clearly:

If your motivation for asking the question is “I would like to participate in a discussion about ______”, then you should not be asking here. However, if your motivation is “I would like others to explain ______ to me”, then you are probably OK. (Discussions are of course welcome in our http://chat.stackexchange.com/real time web chat.)
To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …

every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”
your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”
there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”
we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”
it is a rant disguised as a question: “______ sucks, am I right?”


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I should also note that "this question cannot be answered" may be a valid answer to some questions - assuming there's sufficient rationale given for this response ("the author gave only contradictory hints in his work, and died without recording a canonical answer anywhere"). However, "I don't know" is *not* a valid answer.


















A  question I just stumbled upon, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/356/why-are-there-ending-of-the-series-death-note-so-different-in-manga-and-animeWhy is the ending of Death Note in the anime so different from the manga?, is an example of the generic question type: "Why did they change X?" or "Why did they write it that way?". The only person that can answer these questions are the writers, resulting in any such question being unanswerable if there isn't an answer posted somewhere on the internet. As is outlined in the FAQ of every Stack Exchange site, You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Since the vast majority of these questions won't be answerable, they should all be closed. After all, any answer not based on an official statement from the author would be 100% speculation. 

I'm sure someone will raise the objection that since some of these questions have answers somewhere on the internet that those ones should be opened. However, since there is no way of knowing if such an answer exists until someone posts it, then that means we can't know if an answer is answerable when the question is posted. If we can't know a question is answerable, then it's unanswerable.

For the sake of argument, let's assume we did allow these questions when an answer from the author exists. Since we still can't know if the question is answerable when it's posted, it means we would either need to:


Assume an answer exists until the question goes unanswered for a certain amount of time.
Assume an answer doesn't exist until someone finds it.


Neither of these situations is acceptable. Assuming an answer exists for a set amount of time will result is likely to  have the question be forgotten about, and never closed (clogging up the site with questions which should have been closed and deleted). In addition, any time we chose would be completely arbitrary. Do we wait an hour? A day? A week? If we need to start making arbitrary rules up to allow a question that's a clear indication the question should not be allowed.

Assuming an answer doesn't exist means we'd need to close the question, and then leave it on the site in a closed state indefinitely, until someone posts a comment saying they found an answer. Frankly, this is a completely ridiculous course of action to take. Having a bunch of closed questions floating around is just as bad as having a bunch of opened questions which should be closed. 

Furthermore, closing is meant to be a temporary state, where all questions will either be deleted or re-opened (in the latter because the author fixed them). Closing isn't intended to be used on a question we never have any intention of re-opening unless a specific event eventually happens. After all, if we're just going to keep the question around forever, what's the point of even closing it in the first place? 

In conclusion, "Why did they write it that way?" questions should be deemed off-topic since they are not answerable. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Why did they write it that way?" questions should be off-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a side note, the only exception to the "temporary state" rule for closing is duplicates, which are kept around for the sake of navigation of SEO (aka making things easier for users)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1.  I agree wholeheartedly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I upvoted this question because it's important to make it clear, but I disagree with your conclusions. On StackOverflow I gained the [Necromancer badge](http://stackoverflow.com/badges/17/necromancer), a silver one. It's about answering a more than 2 month old question. Do you hear a bell ringing? Not only a similar workflow is allowed, but it's actively promoted by the badge mechanism.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chirale I don't see how the Necromancer badge is relevant to my post. There's a difference between a question not having been answered, and not being answerable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In 4th paragraph of your question you are asking how much we have to wait to consider a question unanswerable (I'm misinterpreting?). I tell you the SE system actively promote answering questions older than 2 months. So, for the system, waiting for a proper answer is not bad. And I'm talking about a SE about software, where 2 months are a very long time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chirale Yeah, you're slightly misunderstanding what I'm saying. What I meant was that due to the nature of the questions, it's impossible to know if they are answerable until someone answers it, which is just as bad as being unanswerable. In my fourth paragraph I was outlining that a rule where we keep them open for X amount of time in order to see if they are answerable just wouldn't work, since any time chosen would be arbitrary. Something else (which your example made me think of) is that we don't deem questions unanswerable just because no one has answered them, which would also...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...mean that waiting X amount of time just wouldn't make sense.


















My 2 cents is that such questions should not be allowed, for two reasons.


The answer is usually easily searchable. Most series have their dedicated wikis, where this information is available complete with color-coding. As a result, asking this question in itself, constitutes poor research and as per SE rule/etiquette, would be closed.
In many cases, episodes cannot be separated easily into "canon" and "filler". Several canon episodes have some amount of filler in between. It would be impossible to give a perfectly correct answer, because it would involve, "from 4:30 to 8:00 in episode 487, the main characters just fool around, which is not in the manga, and hence filler."

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51 - Why can't we incorporate that knowledge here, though?  I don't see any issue with that; question quality aside, having the knowledge of what is filler and what is canon wouldn't be had knowledge to have here.  2 - that comes back to well-defining canonical events.  If it happens in the manga but not in the anime, vice versa, is explained in other material - that's the key issue that needs to be hammered out.  Certain series *can* have well-defined canon, and that's what I'm trying to tease out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51. It opens up a huge can of worms. If we allow those questions, then logically we would also have to allow questions like, "In which episode do X and Y fight?"
2. It is most practical to define filler as something which is not included in the anime, because unless the series has ended, you cannot really tell whether some "silly"/casual scenes in the manga are filler or not. There have been several instances when something in the manga seems to be a filler, but turns out to be plot-relevant later on. If you follow One Piece, the story arc where Strawhats meet Laboon is an example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I prefer answers on Stack Exchanges since they are moderated, more articulate, and better answers float to the top.  I'm sure I'm not the only one.


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/69/what-differentiates-anime-from-regular-cartoonsWhat differentiates anime from regular cartoons? has been closed twice as off-topic and reopened both times, and hasn't changed much over that period. Rather than vote to close it again (and eventually reopen it again), I think we should discuss here on meta why we think it should be considered on- or off-topic. Since the site's scope isn't yet set in stone, presumably these correspond to different viewpoints of what should/should not be considered off-topic. If people enunciate these more clearly, I think it's likely that we'll come to some sort of consensus.

I don't really have an opinion either way, but I don't think it's beneficial for the site in the long run to keep closing and reopening the question without discussing why.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is "What differentiates anime from regular cartoons?" off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've enunciated my opinions on the comments right below the question. I think that it is on-topic, provided that the answerer is careful in the subjectiveness of his answer. And btw, I think it suffered some changes: initially it asked for more subjective answers, now it asks for more technical ones. IMO!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As someone who cast the initial close vote on the question in its original state, I just wanted to state for the record that I agree it should remain open now. As such, I'm going to delete my original comment I left about it, as it no longer applies to the question in its current form. Hopefully, that will help lessen confusion.


















First of all, look at the revision history. The question was posted, then revision 3 fixed some grammar errors, and the question was closed. After that it was reopened and closed again. However, between the first closing, the reopening, and the second closing, no meaningful changes were made to the post. Really, none at all, just re-tagging. Finally, the question is now reopened after being rephrased and re-titled.

Why did this happen? No mystery at all. The original question title was How do you explain your friends that anime is different from cartoon?. Is it a good title for a QA site? Definitely not. It implies debate, because everyone has different friends and will use different ways to persuade them. In this form, there was no way to give a reasonable and fact-supported answer.

Now, at the last revision (rev. 7 at the moment), the title is What differentiates anime from regular cartoons?, and the question (after being rephrased)  asks exactly this. The differences between anime and cartoons. Can it be answered now? Absolutely. There clearly are differences between anime and cartoons, otherwise there would have been no differentiation between them. So in this form, the question can be answered, thus it was reopened. The amount of votes for both the question and the answers also suggest that the community likes them.

Basically, this process is not unique: many questions start in a bad shape, get down-voted, closed, then edited and reopened (maybe multiply times). There's nothing wrong with it really, that is why the reopening feature is there: to give the opportunity to improve the question. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very well said. This is a great example of a [se] workflow on a question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. In its original state, it deserved to be closed. In its current state, it deserves to be open. It's a learning experience for everyone involved over what makes a good question and a poor question. Hopefully these people won't make the same mistakes again, but future users certainly will. That, as you said, is exactly how the system is intended to work. Closure is temporary (except for duplicates). A closed question should always get deleted or reopened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's also why the "closing" is there. Perhaps they should call it "pause", because that's what it is. A pause that the OP or others can use to fix it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is not a thing called "regular cartoon". For a Japanese "regular" is anime, and anime is animation, so this question is biased by the observer's cultural perspective and confusing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question doesn't seem to be in danger of being closed again, and as of now there's no one arguing it should be closed here. I think this is a good explanation for why the question is fine now.


















In MetaJLU, there is a https://japanese.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/756/resources-for-learning-japaneselist of resources for learning Japanese.  

I thought this could be a good reference for something we might do here: create a list of works of reference that may introduce new users into the manga/anime world. This could go from technical works (that provide technical and theoretical details of manga/anime, as well as history of these media) to more informal works that would provide general views into Japanese/otaku culture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Carey_%28novelist%29Peter Carey's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrong_about_JapanWrong About Japan comes to mind). It could also, if this kind of questions were to be considered on-topic, contain works that are concerned with the making of anime/manga.  

This is just a general idea, but I think it could turn out to be a good thing. Leave your thoughts.

I'm not sure if this has been discussed before, but how do we define anime here in anime.SE? Is it the distinctive art style? Being an animated production originating from Japan? A bit of both?

For instance:


Avatar: The Last Air Bender has an anime-inspired art style. Is it anime?
Batman: The Animated Series has had its animation done in Japanese studios. Is it anime?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How is anime defined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd recommend adding to your list [Batman: Gotham Knight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Gotham_Knight) and [Animatrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatrix).


















I think there's nothing wrong with them, but only if the question is directly about the studio or author in that tag. But the author's tag should not be used on every question about an author's anime just because they happen to be the author.

Take this example: 


  "How much contribution did author XXX make to anime YYY? Is it true that along with working on the story, he was the one who suggested to change the character's hair color from green to blue?"


No matter if this question would be on-topic or not, it could have used the author's name tag, because it's rather about the author than about the anime. If, however, it was phrased like 


  "Who made the decision to change the character's hair color from green to blue?"


it wouldn't deserve the author tag anymore.

So these tags should be used carefully, and questions that use them improperly should be re-tagged quickly.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This makes sense (I edited to strengthen the main point a bit). If (for example) there were a [akira-toriyama] tag, you shouldn't expect it contain an exhaustive listing of all his works, but rather a listing of questions involving the author himself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really like this explanation and it seems others do as well, so I'm going to make it as accepted even though there are no other answers.


















I've been asking in beta about anime crossovers 'cause I'm really interested about it. But they always vote for my question to be closed. Is topic about anime crossovers too off-topic to ask here? Just making sure so that my effort of asking won't be forsaken. Thanks a lot. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is asking about "Anime Crossovers" off-topic here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It sounds a bit like a list-type question. The recipe of not-constructive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll give you an example of what I asked, "What particular anime first showcased crossover?" Is this not-constructive?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hence "a bit like". So it's not completely in that category. But it's still leaning slightly in that direction.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How come? I think it's like asking "What was the first anime?" and just an answer of "Astroboy". Is that under a list-type of question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be very nitpicky, it was because "Anime(s)" was plural in the question. That immediately raised the "not-constructive" flag when I first read it. But now that I read it again, it isn't that bad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I used "Anime(s)" because I'm not sure if the answer involves only one or two or more animes. So, can I conclude that "anime crossovers" topic is allowed in here, and that it only depends on how the user asked the question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"and that it only depends on how the user asked the question?" - Unfortunately, that actually is indeed the case. Numerous times on meta.SO I see people saying that X question needs to be phrased better. Because how the question is asked will solicit different types of answers. If it is phrased improperly, it could solicit the type that will ultimately turn the question into a non-constructive trap.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All a while I thought that "anime crossovers" is off-topic here. Since they've been voting to close my questions about it. Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should I pull the comments into an answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mysticial, can you then answer my question here, not as comment but as an answer? Thanks.


















Your question is, and is not a list question at the same time. 

On one hand, it indeed needs a short answer containing only the anime name. However, there is one problem: we can't know everything.

What does that mean in your context? That means that the question will become a list question eventually. Some person might think "Hey ok, Anime AAA was the first one, since it was released in 1990", and post it as an answer. Then another person comes and thinks "Hey, but there was also Anime BBB which appeared a year earlier!", and posts this as his own answer. Then another person comes... and so on and so forth. So eventually it will be a list-competition question with people trying to remember earlier and earlier examples of crossovers.

Probably if you rephrase the question to somehow avoid such a situation, it will be gladly reopened.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks. But what you mentioned as an example, should that be a problem? I mean, you want to know the "first", so if someone knows the "earliest", then much better. Or should it be a problem? I thought that by "list-type", you mean like asking "Enumerate animes that starts with letter 'A'" type of question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@xjshiya, I don't know if it is _that much_ of a problem, or if this is enough to close it. I've just seen that before, so I decided to let you know ;)


















Pulling the comments into here:

When I first read the title:


  What particular anime(s) first showcased crossovers?


It immediately struck me as being the typical non-constructive question. Why? Because it sounds like it is asking for a list.

At the very core, the question is fairly legit. There can only be one Anime that had the first crossover. So it has an objective answer to it. I won't go into whether or not that answer is obtainable as SingerOfTheFall's answer covers that quite well.

However, the trick to these borderline questions is that they need to be phrased correctly.
Depending on a how a question is phrased, it can lead to different types of answers. Phrasing it incorrectly could send the question into a downward spiral towards non-constructive land.

As your current title stands, the plural on "anime(s)" could possibly bait many answers from different people who have opinions on what is "among the first". But phrasing it as:


  "What Anime first showcased crossovers?"


would tip it back towards that constructive direction. To make the question more constructive, you can request that all answers have authoritative evidence that they are the first. (https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/Skeptics has a policy of requiring references to avoid this speculation trap.)

But as SingerOfTheFall mentions, it may be difficult in this case. But that's a separate issue.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I mentioned a while ago, "Anime(s)" was used because the answer can be hypothetically be like this, "The first anime that showcased crossovers is the Anime1 that involved the appearance of Character2 from Anime2". It was just use because of the uncertainty of the probable answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then we're stuck in a hole aren't we? If the only way to make the question possible is to phrase non-constructively then that's gonna be an issue. Don't get me wrong though. Whether or not the question can be answered is a completely separate issue from whether it is constructive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not really: "Which pair/group of animes got crossed over first", or "when did the first crossover between animes occur" would be unambiguous about the count. It's a matter of wording and good will in reading. And even if not, I see no reason why a list of first few crossovers would be wrong - it's not like the list is arbitrarily long and would elicit undue, unwelcome discussion if the fifth is one of the first or isn't.


















And what if the correct and satisfactory answer appears within first hour or two, before even the question reaches enough votes for closing? Still delete?

You make an awful lot of assumptions about the answer being unavailable. Following your logic, all questions ever should be closed because if you don't know the answer, you can't be sure it exists.

Of course speculative answers should be downvoted, but... what about a normally commonly acceptable question that doesn't get a satisfactory answer? I'm active on quite a few .se sites and you'll hardly ever see my accept rate on any to be 100% - sometimes I ask difficult questions and don't get valid answers at all. Not because they don't exist but because nobody who saw my question knows them. Does that make my questions wrong? Should I know a'priori before asking if the answer is available?

Making up a rule that depends on the asker knowing a whole lot about the answer is pointless: you ask questions to which you don't know answers.

Making a rule that forbids a question because the answer might be impossible to attain is throwing out the baby with the bath water. A whole bunch of good questions will be forbidden on basis that they might be unanswerable.

If you really feel so sick about leaving some questions unanswered, delete them a month after they received their last unsatisfactory answer. But personally, I'd leave them - just for people seeking the answer to be able to find out: 

The Answer Does Not Exist Or Is Uobtainable.

This is a satisfactory answer if it's true. There is no point to consider the question invalid simply because that is the answer.

EDIT

Just to make it clear, repeating my comment here: Yes, authoritative answers to these questions can only be obtained from creators. BUT WHY DIRECTLY?! They are the very daily bread for these creators, appearing regularly in their blogs (frequently buried 20 pages in, of an obscure site), in panels from conferences (often recorded as Youtube videos) or in articles posted on niche magazines many issues back. Oh, and more frequently than not they are posted in Japanese.

That means they are very frequently available, obtainable, possible to locate - but not by a single person. You can't google a sentence uttered in the middle of a hourly panel in youtube video. You can't google contents of paper magazine you don't even own. You won't pick out the author's post on his own site from a thousand similar posts filled with speculations if you don't even know what is his site.

But then, if you post such a question, it will immediately ring a bell with a fan who saw/read the author's answer in the past. They have the blog bookmarked and limiting Google search to that single site they can find it in a minute. Typing conference name and the author name will bring up the video of the panel in Youtube search immediately. Finding the article in the pile of magazines under the bed will take a while but then the answer is there and can be retyped together with the issue number and page for reference.

In other words, LOCATING these answers is possible primarily through community effort.

Do you think forbidding this kind of answers is right, just because there is a chance that the author never did answer this question in the past?

Excuse me, let us close all General Relativity questions on Physics.se because Albert Einstein isn't willing to answer them in person. The fact these answers are contained within his journal? But gasp! what if they are not?!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No.  Absolutely not.  You're missing the fundamental point: these questions cannot be answered by anyone but the creators.  These questions don't fit well with the SE network because it's supposed to be a source of authoritative answers.  Questions that *cannot* be answered without creator intervention are *bad* questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert: Yes, only the creators. The creators have obscure blogs, reply in interviews to magazines, make talks in panels of conferences (recorded on Youtube) and so on. These questions and answers to them are their daily bread. Now *locating* these resources and these answers is often beyond power of a single user (you can't google a sentence uttered in the middle of a hourly panel in youtube video!), while a large community should be able to pinpoint that easily and cite/link given authoritative answer easily.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is that *there is no guarantee whatsoever* that we'll be able to provide any answer to these types of questions.  Having to rely on a tiny group of people in order to be able to answer it flies in the face of being able to provide authoritative answers.  At that point, we stop being *experts*, and we're just mouthpieces for the creators.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert: Are you not an expert for being able to tell the book name and chapter where given very obscure piece of information is made known? And what a kind of expert are you if you discard a valid question only because neither you nor any of other experts *might* not know the answer? It's like a teacher who tells the kid "Sit down, your question is wrong" for being asked something from an area where knowledge is full of gaps and they're not sure they will be able to find the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your analogy needs some work.  This isn't a teacher telling a student to sit down for asking something that they *might* not be able to answer.  This is a student asking a question that the teacher *cannot* answer.  It depends on pure luck if the person who CAN answer it, HAS answered it.  That doesn't make me an expert in the subject matter, being able to find an obscure blog post.  That makes me an expert at trawling the internet, which is a completely different expert.  And to address your edit: Yes, forbidding these answers because the author might never answer it is right.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then we disagree here. I believe it is better to have ten questions with three answers than zero questions with zero answers. You seem to think seven unanswerable questions is more of a negative than three answered ones are of a positive. For me it's nothing but throwing out the child with bathwater.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed we do.  The SE network is based off of increasing the signal to noise ratio.  Unanswerable questions increase the noise, and are exactly the sort of thing we shouldn't be allowing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Cut signal to decrease noise. I get it. I don't agree, but I get it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Increase the noise? With such a trend, anime and manga se will totally refuses to answer questions about creative processes, filling the site with only questions about universes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chirale Which is exactly what anime.SE is for.  This isn't animeproduction.SE, mangaproduction.SE, or anything of the sort.  This is to ask questions *directly* related to anime and their universe, not, "How was anime X made?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert: You are entirely wrong here. http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/2942/anime-are-questions-on-the-entities-behind-productions-on-topic - 11 votes for, no votes against.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see your area51 link, and match it with a meta link on our own site: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6/are-questions-about-how-to-make-anime-and-manga-off-topic/.  11 votes for, two against.  And one against your suggestion of allowing it.  I'd think our own site takes precedence over an area51 discussion.  And there's not even a dissenting answer on yours.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert I think you're missing the difference between questions about generic tools for production and a question about creative process behind a given anime. The reason given in the question you linked is all too clear: that particular question is a better fit for a different site. Now where would you "flush" answers to the examples from the one I linked?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert I agree with SF. Question you cited is not something you can see black or white, it's about seeing the difference about "hey, I want to make an anime, what software I can use?" (off-topic) and "What software Makoto Shinkai used in his first self-made movie?" (ok). If Anime and manga SE doesn't allow question like this, it'll became a mere index for Wikia.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're both missing the point.  These questions are *fundamentally* unanswerable by us, as layman users.  The only way we'll know which software Makoto Shinkai used **is if he tells us**.  That, right there, is why these questions are bad.  How do you prove that one of these questions *is* answerable?  Keep it open for X amount of time?  Close it until someone has an answer?  One is a broken window that will attract speculation, and the other is a fundamental misuse of SE.  We're not here to index and catalogue data found on the net.  We're here to ask, and answer, practical, useful questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert: "Layman users"? Aren't we supposed to be the experts? To counter: If I ask which sound studio recorded English version of given anime, I would find very unlikely for this information not to be present in end credits. By your logic we can't ask any plot-related questions because they would have to be answered in one episode or another, and you can't be sure if an episode that answers them exists. And in series of 500 episodes you really, really can't be sure if the answer didn't appear in 17th minute of ep384 or if it was left unsaid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're nitpicking details without addressing the actual point.  Once you address that point, we can talk.  Until then, this discussion is wholely useless.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert: No, I'm addressing the core topic: contrary to your (baseless) claim, I say these questions are mostly answerable; mostly = in no lesser degree than questions commonly accepted and fully welcome. All questions bear a risk of being unanswerable. It's the matter of drawing the line. You are drawing it way, way on the "likely answerable" side, way past questions deemed okay by the community. As for your last point, tell me which *practical*, *useful* question anime.SE serves and what is more practical and useful, questions "how to create..." or "whom did Goku fight..."?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's where I disagree.  Questions should be answerable (and ideally *verifiable*) without requiring ANY creator intervention.  That's easily done with questions about the series universe, because you can just watch the series again as needed.  Take a look at Wipqozn's examples above.  There's NO way for us to determine if these questions are answerable.  What do we do?  Leave them open?  Close them until someone says they have an answer?  Both options are addressed.  Especially leaving it open: it will lower site quality drastically, and lead to them being closed anyways.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fundamentally, I encourage questions that we, as users (layman/experts/whatever), can answer, and verify.  These questions cannot be verified in ANY manner.  All we have is hearsay, which may or may not be correct.  We can't be an authoritative site if there's no method available for us to verify the information.  That's where your example with relativity falls apart: it wasn't invented (and didn't die) with Einstein.  That's real, testable, verifiable data.  A link to an obscure blog that may or may not be real is a single data point with no basis.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert: A screenshot of end credits? Link to official site? Interview in a magazine? Blog linked from reliable source as owned by author? Some questions about the process of making which are perfectly answerable and 100% verifiable. Besides, visit StackOverflow. There are thousands of questions about APIs and libraries open and without answers or with wrong guesses for answers. Reason: Wrong/No info in official docs; would need word of author. Docs of APIs *ARE* lacking and everyone knows that. Should all API/Libraries questions be forbidden then because we can't guarantee answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're still dancing around the issue and from what I can tell, deliberately avoiding it.  This isn't about questions about things that can be verified by watching the show or visiting the official site.  It's about, "Why did they write it that way?" questions.  I'm done arguing with you about it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert: NO! I gave up on that long ago! Have your way with "Why did they?", if you must - I still say this is throwing out the child with bathwater but if this is the policy here, all right. I'm addressing your opposition to all questions about creative production, your notion "This isn't animeproduction.SE, mangaproduction.SE". I gave good solid examples where production questions are on-topic and 100% answerable. Any issue with that?


















From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnimeWikipedia:


  Anime (Japanese: アニメ?, [a.ni.me] ( listen); i/ˈænɨmeɪ/ or /ˈɑːnɨmeɪ/)
  are Japanese cartoons and computer animation.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime1 The word is the
  abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese. In English, the
  term is defined as a style of animation originating in Japan, which
  often features colorful graphics, vibrant characters and action-filled
  plots with fantastic or futuristic themes.[2] The intended meaning of
  the term sometimes varies depending on the context.[3]


And


  English-language dictionaries define anime as "a Japanese style of
  motion-picture animation" or as "a style of animation developed in
  Japan"


From those two definitions I'd conclude an anime is:


An animated work.
One that is of Japanese style
One that is made in Japan.


By that definition, none of your examples fit the bill (Avatar wasn't made in Japan, while Batman doesn't have the Japanese style).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now you "just" have a problem with defining what the hell you mean by "Japanese style". Examples: "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within", "Appleseed Ex Machna", "Maya the Bee" or the "Momotarou" series of short films (日本一桃太郎, 空の桃太郎, 海の桃太郎).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While we could argue the conjunction, whether your cases should be connected with OR or with AND, at least please drop 'series' from your definition. Otherwise we're sending the whole Studio Ghibli down the drain.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF.: How's "work"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha: Okay (it isn't perfectly precise, say, web flash animations would count, but that's nitpicking). Now for me it would be important: *In English, the term is defined as a style of animation originating in Japan*. Meaning western Anime is still Anime. Although we may apply far more loose constraints to movies made in Japan and demand the Western to be much more "classic" to be acceptable. Oh, and we could just broaden "works tangential to anime are conditionally acceptable"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MartinSojka: These were made in Japan, but does the style originate in Japan, or is it just a Japanese derivative of western styles?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF: Momotarou (being from the 1920-ties) is based on original Japanese style. On the other hand, Naruto (just to name an example) is not - it's based on the style popularised by Osamu Tezuka, who in turn based it on the style of early Disney cartoons.


















I think it's a very good idea. We have https://stackoverflow.com/q/3737139/871050reference questions on Stack Overflow as well.

Only I don't think it should be done on the meta site, but on the main site, and as a community-wiki. This is a question regarding anime/manga, not about the anime/manga site, therefore I suggest we open it on the main site.

But having them on the main site will make them more searchable. :)


















I think that usually they don't have really a reason to exist, unless


It's a very prominent character, that stands out;
There are many questions about this specific character.


For example, on SciFi, there is a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/voldemortvoldemort tag. It is a prominent character (the main antagonist and what an antagonist!) and there are 80 questions with this tag. That makes it a good tag. There will definitely be people searching for this tag.

One single tag about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-from-animecharacter-from-anime would probably be too little. Is it really an interesting character, widely appreciated? If the question is no, it probably doesn't deserve a tag.

In any case, we don't need to take all the decisions now. I think it's best if we decide as we go on, keeping the tags we realize work and cutting those that we see have no reason to exist. But what I said will give us some parameters to decide and to anticipate what tags might work and which ones wouldn't.

I'd argue we should collectively disallow them. Even if the intention is good, things will get out of hand real quick.

Imagine the following:


  "What is the relationship between Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura?"
  
  https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonarutohttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naruto-uzumakinaruto-uzumakihttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sasuke-uchihasasuke-uchihahttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sakura-harunosakura-haruno


Even if you do limit to "only notable characters" or "only protagonists/antagonists", the line is far to blurred out to be used correctly.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I concur! A simple [tag:character] tag or equivalent would suffice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree but only as a general rule. Some characters do deserve a special tag. :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno: Like which? I can't think of a character so notable, so distinctly important that it deserves a tag at the same level of entire anime titles.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I **have** to agree with Madara (he used genjutsu). No really, I agree with Madara.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha Again, it's not something we must define a priori.  Besides, the fact you can't think of one does not prove there isn't one. :P We're still in private beta, remember! :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Characters from different anime that have the same name are another landmine. In fact, at least in my case, this problem can occur *within* one anime. I am one of the most popular characters in the Fate franchise, but I am known primarily to most of my fans as "Saber" rather than "King Arthur" or "Arturia Pendragon". However, in the Fate universe, the "Saber" Servant Class encompasses quite a number of other characters.


















If you have ever read manga, or even watched anime - where this is less common - you will probably come across something described as 'Japanese Sound Symbols'. They are also known as 'sound symbolic', mimetic, ideophones and Japanese onomatopoeia. You can view much of the dynamics of sound symbols on the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_sound_symbolismWikipedia Page.

Some of the listed examples were:


じろじろ - jirojiro - Stare intently
きらきら - kirakira - Sparkle
どきどき - dokidoki - Heart beat
ぴんぴん - pinpin - Lively
しいんと - shi~nto - Silence


So, I thought that because it's mostly used in Anime & Manga, it may be on-topic here. However because it's in relation to expressions in Japanese, therefore - wouldn't those topics belong in the https://japanese.stackexchange.com/Japanese Language & Usage? 

Remember that the sound symbols are in Japanese, used in Japanese,  for the Japanese and to express Japanese terms. The only thing it has to do with Anime and Manga is that it is used in the books/episodes! 

You can see this question about whether https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/69/should-we-allow-questions-that-are-about-japanese-language-use-in-anime-mangaquestions about the Japanese language should be on-topic, but the answer has suggested that it 'relates the the personality of the character' - however these expressions only express the being/situation/feelings of the character. Another example is this question about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/39/does-the-bloody-nose-trope-necessarily-imply-a-sexual-situationthe classic blood-nose symbol. However, because this is in special relation to anime (obviously because real people probably do not get a blood nose when 'excited' :P).

I'd like some opinions on this, thanks in advance.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are Japanese Sound Symbols on-topic here, or on Japanese Language & Usageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can it/is it used outside of anime/manga?

As I use Wiki sometimes help to establish my point, is there possibility that I can do it with sites that I can watch anime online?

I agree that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga tags are just too general.  Why not instead have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-onlyanime-only or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-specificmanga-specific type tags.  This removes the ambiguity of the general tags and makes their use very obvious.

When asking a question about the difference between the manga and anime, I would have never thought to use the variations tag.  Can we create a synonym of this tag as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-manga-differenceanime-manga-difference, or at least https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/differencesdifferences?

It seems like a clear meta-tag. Shouldn't this information be in the titles, rather than the tag? More [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/110/71), at the original meta discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Marking as declined for lack of a better status because we did away with the variations tag long ago and so this request doesn't really make sense anymore.


















I'm not a fan of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-manga-differenceanime-manga-difference. Of the 9 questions tagged as this, 4 of them aren't about comparing anime and manga. It would quickly get out of hand if we had tags for every pair such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novel-anime-differencelight-novel-anime-difference,https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-movie-differenceanime-movie-difference, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/visual-novel-live-action-differencevisual-novel-live-action-difference (okay maybe the last one is unlikely, but you get the picture). Furthermore, it's not clear what should be done if there are 2 different versions of the anime. If I wanted to ask what the differences are between Eat-Man '97 and Eat-Man '98, would I use the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-anime-differencesanime-anime-differences? That's just silly.

I don't have a strong feeling one way for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/differencesdifferences vs. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variationsvariations, but it's not clear to me that the former is more intuitive than the latter. I'd be very surprised if new users use the correct tag regardless of which we choose. From a practical standpoint, I'm just slightly in favor of keeping the status-quo, simply because people are already using it and may not notice the switch.

If we had already started public beta, I'd be quite a bit less willing to switch without a good argument.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see `variations` being really clear, well actually it makes no sense to me. I would agree on `differences`, that does express "difference".

Personally, I am a fan of having tags https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-specificanime-specific and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-specificmanga-specific, along with related tags for other formats. This solves the biggest problem with the originals, namely overuse.

The main criticism I can see with the tags is that they don't provide much useful differentiation. Most people have a number of series that they are interested in and follow both the manga and anime, and a lot of the other questions will be about things that they haven't even watched. Slicing the other way, namely based on medium rather than series, would seem to be a pretty pointless endeavor.

I would like to argue against that viewpoint. While it is true that the majority of people have favorite series, most people also have favorite media. Currently, two people are following https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/visual-novelvisual-novel and two more on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novellight-novel. These formats are likely to attract a different crowd than most anime and manga, in part because they typically require some knowledge of Japanese. 

Furthermore, a lot of people are only interested in canon materials, and want to avoid anything that isn't canon. Those people could ignore https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-specificanime-specific which would filter out a lot of questions about filler episodes and other uninteresting content.

And finally, these questions can also be about things related to the medium, rather than the content. There aren't many questions like this on the main site at the moment (excluding those tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production, which I think is separate), but a good example of a question like this is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/370/why-was-the-melancholy-of-haruhi-suzumiya-broadcast-out-of-sequenceWhy was The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya broadcast out of sequence?. The question is at least partially medium-specific, and likewise my answer was very much medium-dependent. So someone interested in anime in an academic sense would probably have interest in things like this. To be sure, even in the good cases, there's some grey area in which https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variationsvariations and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production could also apply to some of these questions, but certainly not all of them.

Of course, all of these are pretty uncommon, and the tags should probably be used sparingly. But at least in principle, they do provide some useful differentiation. I don't think they will be heavily followed, but I also don't see anything bad about allowing them in the modified version.

Since we're talking about fictional worlds with magic/alchemy/whatever, it's harder to tell the difference between an answer based off of a certain scene and an answer based off of whatever the user thinks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza Thanks, good point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Especially on real life question, this should be a must. Talking about fiction, to cite the episode number or the chapter will protect from spoiler effectively.


















Since I can, because I am me and I can... Ok, now seriously. :P

I have the privileges to change the chat room name and description, so let's propose new names! Consider that you should:


Propose a name (possibly explain why that name);
And a description if you want, even if maybe we can keep this one since it points to the main site.


In any case, provide one per answer, so other people can vote on a single proposal. :)

I think even Japanese actually use "Anime" to refer to Japanese-style cartoons only. And I doubt you'll ever see a Japanese calling a Disney cartoon "Anime".

I'm telling that anime from a Japanese perspective are "regular" cartoons. All anime are cartoons, but only Japanese cartoons are anime. So the "regular" term is misleading and assume a foreign perspective, because reduce cartoons to foreign cartoons.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I doubt that too.

Name: "Cat's Eye" 

Origin: The name originates from a cafe reoccurs in many series drawn and authored by Tsukasa Hojo (Originated in Cat's Eye, reoccurs in City Hunter and Angel Heart). The cafe is run by a trio of sister that moonlight as art thieves under the name of "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Eye_(manga)Cat's Eye." A reference to this is also made in Clamp's Tsubasa Chronicles.

Reasoning: The cafe recurs in many anime and manga universes, so it seems like a good place to mingle and talk about various anime and manga. My first choice would probably have been "http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/AhnenerbeAhnenerbe" from the Type-Moon metafiction, it's also a cafe shop with two entrances located beside a cinema or large bridge, and it exists in multiple locations across multiple meta-universes. Here various characters from the Type-Moon universe can meet people that they would not otherwise be able to without causing inconsistencies in the workings of either world of timeline (E.g., Shiki from Tsukihime and Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai). I wound up not choosing "Ahnenerbe" because of it's negative relation with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AhnenerbeNazi culture.

Explanation:
Ahnenerbe is, in the Type-Moon fandom, the cafe where characters from different franchises meet to speak to each other and explain aspects of the story.

Anyway, rather more relevant, http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Ahnenerbe


















In the particular case you have listed, I'd rather the title be changed to "What differentiates anime from other cartoons?" (changing "regular" to "other"), which I guess is the neutral perspective. It seems to me that it is best to use objective terms whenever possible.

However, I don't think we should change every question and answer to fit with one particular perspective. It's not a very important consideration, as Alenanno has said. If there's an easy way to change it to the objective perspective, then I think it's alright to do so, but if you find that you have to rewrite entire sentences to accomplish it, then you're probably infringing on the original author's stylistic rights.

tl;dr: We should not mandate a particular perspective, but we should support the objective perspective whenever it is convenient to do so.

And it's relevant because the question set the tone of the following answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chirale Good point. I don't think we should go around changing things like this without the author's permission.


















I want to ask question about Naruto (the 2005 version).
And I think that if I say something like "what happened in the 10 episode?" it may cause some misunderstandings.

[tag:naruto] should refer to everything in the Naruto-franchise, including both anime series, IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5why? it's like total different series...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As far as I know, the manga didn't change names, so it's still the same series. More importantly, it cuts down on the number of tags. If we allowed a shippuuden tag, we'd also have to start adding fma-brotherhood, clannad-after-story, etc. I don't see what it adds except one more tag for everyone to favorite/ignore.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So what do you suggest to do?
Treat it like it's the same anime and every time to re-emphasize if it belongs to the old or the new series?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you think it's likely that people will misunderstand, in your question title or body, use something like "In episode 10 of Naruto (original series), ..."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do not think it's such a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also it's like "Dragonball" it isn't "Dragonball-z" etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like @LoganM said in the manga Naruto and Naruto:Shippuden ARE just one whole series. No name changed. When you ask a question you could just put, "In episode XX of Naruto:Shippuden (or just Naruto if it's just in the first series) this happened. If you put Naruto or Naruto:Shippuden it shouldn't confuse anyone, or you could just be referring to the whole series. Which is okay. I mean when I ask questions about Naruto it's normally from the manga, and it hasn't confused anyone yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[status-declined], because I came from Blend S and not Naruto.



















If you ask "In episode XX of Naruto........", it means the first series.  
If you ask "In episode XX of Naruto Shippuuden........", it means the Shippuuden series.


I do not think there is any need to create tags specific to each one of them.

What you've cited is a question that is perfectly, but difficulty, answerable: if an interview or a document with/by the author of the manga or the director of the anime is available.

Here an http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-06-14/bokurano-helmer-changes-story-due-to-dislike-of-mangaexample about Mohiro Kitoh's Bokurano:


  In closing, I have to post what I don't want to post: the director of the animated version of Bokurano dislikes the original manga.


Q: Why Bokurano anime end differently from the manga?
A: Because the director of the anime dislikes the manga (quote)

The answerers have to search sources by original authors before starting speculations, looking for evidences about the creation process of that precise work. 

Actually, answering this question correctly requires a high level of expertise and a deep knowledge of the work by a author, so with some fix it's a very attractive question for SE.

I cited a real example but nobody tell me what it's wrong with that.


















This is a tricky question. First let's see what definitely are spoilers.


If the question is based on anime, using the information from manga chapters that were not yet made into anime episodes is totally a spoiler. I believe that along with including it in a spoiler box, it's a good idea to explicitly state that it comes from manga that has not yet been screened. 
If the question is about the events in a particular episode/chapter, data colected from much later chapters is a spoiler. For example, if the question is "Why did X happen in episode Y?", and the answer is "Because in episode X+100 it's explained, that...". The part after "that" should be put into the spoiler box.


Now, to more controversial examples.


Information about key events, especially about character deaths, should almost always be put into the spoiler box. The exception is if the question is about a specific chapter/episode, and the events happen before that episode. In that case people who haven't watched/read up to this episode/chapter will not open the question in the first place.
I believe that any cross-over information should also be put into the box. For example, if the question is "Why X", and the answer is "Well, do you remember how in anime YY, character ZZ died in episode 75? It's pretty much the same here". Such information should be put into the box. It's frustraiting to come into a question about something you have watched long ago, and be spoiled on the events of another title that you are watching now. 


And finally, every other piece of information that you think might be a spoiler for other people that come by your question/answer, should be put into the box. Don't be too worried: if you put an unnecessary box, or forget to put something important into it, other users will most likely edit your question/answer, or leave a comment for you. Remember, it's absolutely nothing bad including information that is hardly (or not at all) a spoiler into the spoiler box; it doesn't hurt anyone.

So, basically, using common sense is enough to determine whether you should use the box or not.

But nothing denies us from linking Meta questions from the FAQ. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ALenanno, absolutely. I'd even say it's a good practice to do so;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Skimmed and it seems your answer is about *spoiler answers*. What about *spoiler questions* ?


















I would say we only use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball.

As you mentioned with Naturo, we also only use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, especially because Naruto Shippuuden is a continuation of the original story.

It is the same with Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It is a continuation and it does not matter about which series the question is as the question itself needs to make clear what it is about. (and people automatically know which series it is).

Only thing is Dragon Ball GT. I did not watch it (and not planning to), so I do not know whether the story is clashing with Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. If so, we could give it it's separate tag.

But, I think it is better to given them all the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball. As said for many other tags/discussions, the question will make clear what it is about.

Additional note: I would say that we use this reasoning for all tags from now on, otherwise we keep on discussing the same things over and over.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[tag:dragon-ball-gt] should be given a separate tag, since it's a completely different and independent work from he manga.


















I argue that anything later than the scope of the question is considered a spoiler.
For instance, if the question is about the Chuunin Exams arc in Naruto, an answer from an earlier arc (such as the Zabuza arc) shouldn't be marked as spoilers.
If the answer is from a later arc (Rescuing Sasuke, for example), those details should be marked as spoilers.

Aside from that, make sure your title isn't spoilerish, and if it is, generalize it to make it good for reading:
How did Character X break out of Edo Tensei?
Is problematic if Character X broke out of Edo Tensei very recently in the manga, which may spoil it for anime viewers.
How can Edo Tensei be broken?
Is better. It only implies that Edo Tensei can be broken, which isn't very spoilerific. Inside of the questions, also in spoiler tags, should be the detailed question, with some introduction message:
Warning! The following contains spoiler for Naruto anime viewers!

 Spoiler content here

That's my perspective on how we should be treating spoilers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 I think your example used is a *perfect* example of how you can still maintain a good title *without* needing to use spoilers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Asking how did Character X break out the Edo Tensei, is a spoiler it self.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's the point. So don't write titles like those, but instead use the second example I've given.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Edit suggestion: Mention the 1st part of your answer is for *answer spoilers* while the 2nd part is for *question spoilers*


















I'm going to go off the beaten path and suggest the obvious:

Name: Anime and Manga Chat

My personal pet peave is looking through the list of chat rooms and having absolutely no idea what half of them are about. Why obfuscate your chat room behind a list of clever in-jokes and memes? Seems counter-productive. Maybe that's just me.

Lack of research is not a close reason, that's what down votes are for. This is an issue which has come up on multiple Stack Exchange sites, and was implemented with the General Reference close reasons. However, that was considered to be a massive failure and has since been removed on all sites which implemented on it. It just results in users drawing arbitrary lines in the sand for when a question is too simple, which is also why I disagree with your second reason for why these questions should be deemed off-topic. 

Do think these are good questions? No, they're crap, but that's what down votes are for, not close votes.

So you should probably reword that part. :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno It's considered a failure by Stack Exchange, and was the cause of a lot of problems on SFF.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wipqozn Where is that stated?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno: [I believe this close reason has too much potential for abuse and misunderstanding.

Following what was discussed in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/207/rename-tag-naruto-to-naruto-shippuudenthis and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/122/tag-synonyms-and-romanizationthis Meta posts, I think the tag sprawl needs to be contained. Much like we should not have separate tags for the Naruto and the Naruto Shippuuden series, there are some tags on the main site that perhaps should be dealt with:


There are https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonball-zdragonball-z and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonball-gtdragonball-gt tags, but amazingly enough there is no https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonballdragonball tag (but it will most likely appear)
There is a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ghost-in-the-shellghost-in-the-shell tag, but there is also a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ghost-in-the-shell-sacghost-in-the-shell-sac 
There is a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rurouni-kenshinrurouni-kenshin tag, and a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ruroni-kenshinruroni-kenshin tag 
There is a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cardcaptorscardcaptors and a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cardcaptor-sakuracardcaptor-sakura tag


However:  


Naruto Shippuuden, is 'contained' in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, is 'contained' in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist  
The Rebuild Series of Evangelion, The Death & Rebirth of Evangelion, are/will be 'contained' in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion


The ones stated in the first list have specific tags for each specific series/movie or have different spellings.
What should be the site's position in this matter?  

There is also https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/84/should-minimalistic-tags-and-synomoms-be-used-for-anime-with-different-seriesthis debate, but I do not think it is exactly the same thing. Plus, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212/should-we-have-separate-tags-for-the-dragon-ball-seriesthis one concerning Dragonball. I think these discussions should be condensed into this one. However, if you think this is a redundant post close it!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding tag sprawlb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that simplicity is the best, less tags are more searchable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you. I think the tag should have the franchise name, and the specific media or series of the franchise should be specified in-question/title.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Initiate Tag Instrumentality!


















(Just to rewrite it officially)

I think that less tags are better in most cases. They are more searchable, and are sufficient in most cases.

However, to distinguish, it's better to write something specific in the title, for example, as https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/users/51/vegerVeger mentioned in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212/should-we-have-separate-tags-for-the-dragon-ball-seriesthis question, he doesn't want to read questions regarding Dragonball GT (which I can understand), so writing "Dragon Ball GT" somewhere in the title should be enough (Example: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/361/dragon-ball-gt-made-by-fansHow involved was Akira Toriyama in the production of Dragon Ball GT?).

Also, too many Tags can lead to confusion, too, as seen https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/539/what-is-the-difference-between-tachikoma-and-fuchikomahere, where the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ghost-in-the-shell-sacghost-in-the-shell-sac-Tag was chosen, while the normal https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ghost-in-the-shellghost-in-the-shell-Tag was better. 

However, the example https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rurouni-kenshinrurouni-kenshin <-> https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ruroni-kenshinruroni-kenshin is a good candidate for a synonym, like Tags with different spellings in japanese and western languages. I have no other example, but different spellings should are synonyms (see comments below).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'*[tag:rurouni-kenshin]  [tag:ruroni-kenshin] is a good candidate*' -> better make this more general: as in the Western spelling is used for the tag and the Japansese spelling is used as synonym, so people are able to use both. (or something like that)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, [cardcaptors](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cardcaptors) is what [cardcaptor-sakura](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cardcaptor-sakura) is known in the US, and (I believe) nowhere else. So, also a synonym?


















Questions about language and expressions are bound to happen over and over. Another https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/69/should-we-allow-questions-that-are-about-japanese-language-use-in-anime-mangameta makes a point that they sometimes belong here (character-centric) and sometimes, to https://japanese.stackexchange.com/JLU for being generic or not specific to anime.

It is hard for a non-Japanese to know this a'priori, so, we shouldn't penalize (by closing) questions that are a better fit at JLU simply because the author would first need to know the answer to know they are a better fit there. Instead, migrating them once it's been established they are a better fit there should be completely natural reaction.

If the migration path is not yet available, adding a request to admins to create it.

Importing some conclusions from https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3/can-we-also-discuss-visual-novels-light-novels-and-other-related-mediaCan we also discuss Visual Novels, Light Novels and other related media?

To be added to on-topic list:


Visual novels, light novels, and other tangentially related media (e.g. drama CDs) to the "main" anime/manga fandom


Possibly within a separate point:


Fighting, shooters, and similar games derivative from common Anime/Manga franchise:
Plot-centric questions related to events described in these games and how they fit in the plotline of the franchise are on-topic
Questions about game mechanics, technical, and other aspects not related to the plot of these games belong in https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade.

Migration paths are added for non-mod users, for sites where the flow is "constant" and not occasional. Moderators can migrate to any site in any moment, so the absence of migration paths is not a problem.

Until you get a migration path, the course of action that I suggest is:


Vote to close and/or
flag, choose custom and write something like


  Off topic, please migrate to [site]
  
  Be concise. :P In any case, don't do the second while we're still in Beta. Your flag might be declined.


Ah one last thing: Meta is (and will be) always the first option for migrating. :) So you're going to have a maximum of 4 extra sites in general, I think.

If the question is really easy, please no. We shouldn't be aiming at repeating available information in the internet. 

If you want to treat something that is simple but you think that the internet lacks proof or back up for that, then it's a different matter. But asking things like "What's Naruto's last name?" (a stupid example) is really... meh. :)

It's also true that not all information is easy the same way for everybody but let's aim up rather than down.

Some (if not most) of such questions are highly subjective ("what's the best way to...", "should I do X for cosplaying Y", and so on. 
The questions will most likely be about just the look, NOT about the character/story. A question about apparel might be ok if the question is directly connected to the story. (Example: Kempachi's eye patch and bells in his hair, which have concrete reasons of existence plot-wise). I'm sorry, but I personaly do not want questions like "how do I tie the ribbons in my hair the way Haruhi did on Sundays?". Forgive me this weakness.
Some of the questions are going to be like "where do I buy X to cosplay Y", or "How do I make X for my cosplay costume of Y".


For questions about how to make a costume/what fabrics or tools to use, something like http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/36782/clothing-and-fashionthis proposal will be better.

Subjective questions are off-topic on all SE sites. 

So, generally speaking I think such questions should be off-topic.

Ideally, an off-topic question should later be deleted. Once it is deleted, the tag becomes orphaned and will soon after be removed by the system.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just wondering, how long does it usually take for the unused tags to be deleted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SingerOfTheFall I believe the script runs nightly, but don't quote me on that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ok, thanks ;) I was just curious


















https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/143/41Similar to my answer about Vocaloid questions, I think we have to limit cosplay-related questions to those that stem from the source material themselves. 

Questions about character outfits / design in a particular scene is one thing -- like asking about why Lina Inverse's hair changes colors at certain points in Slayers, or what the different rank insignia in FMA are (and what they look like) -- but actual questions about costume design and photography are too subjective and thus outside the scope of this SE.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed about this. Basically, if the question is about the actual character design (as necessary to pull off a costume), then it'd be appropriate, and is something that can even be divorced from cosplay. But if it's about the actual costume design, assembly, or other components like "how to make a really convincing costume", that's not really our topicality.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GraceNote The example you make is on topic, but it's perhaps the only one question we'd welcome and as you said, it would exist even regardless of cosplay.


















I agree.

This subject is very borderline, because the question can ask about anime/manga in particular, however, by nature, most of us cannot answer such questions reliably.

I say we go for safe here, and not accept legal question, especially without any sort of official disclaimer about how the information given here is not legal advice and so on and so forth.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I written in comments below, I'm not seeking for any legal advice. I'm from a totally different jurisdiction from US, and I'm interested more in the social aspect than in the legal one.


















I disagree.

I've made that question and I got a https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/625/98very precise answer, quoting an interview I've never heard about before by the http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/chicks-on-anime/2009-05-05intellectual property specialist of Funimation. The quality of the answers is often determined by the quality of references, and after that an the other answers at that question the AMV acceptance in anime worlds by both copyright holders and fans is more clear to me. SE is made for this.

Clearly, a disclaimer  will be useful to avoid misunderstanding about the scope of the site and I absolutely agree to write it down. But it should not block questions that are about a popular form of derivative works made by fans in public events like anime conventions. It's a social subject, reducing it to a subject only lawyers can talk about is detrimental because ignore the context.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my view the problem is not that the question/answer is bad, but that in certain cases we/SE could be held legally liable for providing misinformation. Though it would be better with a disclaimer, I'm not sure how well that protects us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So we have a single answer from Funimation.  That only applies to it.  How does the answer the question regarding Gainax?  Or 4Kids?  Or any other animation studio?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just stick to reliable sources and avoid law self-teaching. Add a disclaimer on top. But this is not the first, real-world question that it's about to be closed. As I asked before, I repeat: should Anime and manga talk only about fiction, avoiding question about industry and subculture?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert re: "single answer from Funimation" I don't think it's necessary to have an answer from every single anime copyright holder. More would be better, yes, but I think a single answer from Funimation is more relevant than a general quote about copyright law from Wikipedia.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're missing the point; we can talk about anime related stuff all day long.  It's when we question the *legality* of whatever it is (music videos, fansubs, whatever), that we run into problems.  Just putting up a disclaimer is ingenuous at best; people won't read it, and they WILL use answers from here if they run into trouble legally.  It's a handwave to allow questions of this nature.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert Personally, if I ran into legal trouble, I would want something more concrete than SE as my resource in court... I can't speak for others though, so I guess it's possible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert I'm from Italy, and I asked a question about how in the USA anime conventions are allowed to make such contests. I don't seek legal advice, I'm out of the US jurisdiction, but I'm interested in the answer because we have anime conventions too and I'm interested in the social aspect of the entire thing. I don't want to apply US laws in Italy (especially the DMCA), I swear. :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@chirale Heh.  I know you don't; US laws are quite strict (and inane).  You've just highlighted the problem with asking questions about legality: they're fundamentally *unanswerable*.  Sure, we might get bits and pieces here and there, but we have no guarantee that anything we hear is correct!  We're supposed to be experts, and I know, I, for one, am certainly not an expert when it comes to laws.  I'd think allowing these questions means we'd *have* to be law experts in order to answer them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@fbueckert Laws and legal system in Italy are not that better! But the point is that I haven't started the question seeking legal advice. Some recent and smart [answers here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/242/98) get the other half of my question, I'm interested in seeing how the community here will treat this subject.


















This seems like an odd reason to exclude something. I mean, there are folks asking questions about plot points from folks who aren't the writers, and even the creation of anime/manga being answered by folks who are not involved in it... Even though you would hope to attract experts in each topic, at this point there will naturally be a lot of questions that either can't be answered, or must be answered by someone who is not an expert in the topic - hopefully by drawing on information provided by someone who is. 

Now, I tend to agree that questions asking for legal advice should be off-topic, not because they would put answerers in danger but because they're not about anime or manga. 

But the question you use as an example isn't asking for legal advice. It's asking for help understanding certain policies within the anime community which appear to be blamed on copyright law. 

Focusing on the legal aspect here seems to be missing the point. Are anime conventions on-topic? Are anime music videos on-topic? These are the more important questions, and seem to fall in line with many other discussions on the topicality of anime / otaku-related culture here. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question seems to focus on copyright as the main issue.  If you remove copyright from the question, it's no longer a question.  I'm not exactly sure how we could NOT read it as asking for clarification on copyright.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5He's not asking for legal advice, so far as I can see. He's asking what (or if) Anime conventions do anything to comply with copyright law. This seems to be a concrete, answerable question about the operation of such conferences. Whether operating an anime conference is on-topic or not is something y'all should be discussing - but don't get hung up on the "we're not lawyers" bit if no one's asking for legal advice.


















Should we allow comparison of anime characters here? For example, "Which character is better? Character X or Character Y?" Like, 


  Light Yagami (Death Note) VS. Lelouch Vi Britannia


Others might ask something like that or put them (characters that are being compared) into a situation where they will have a fight or something. Or ask something of others' opinion of who's better. Or they might ask of their differences and similarities. 

Should we allow questions like that?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow character comparison here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have any examples of these questions? Your hypothetical sounds blatantly non constructive, but a real live question always helps.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would just like to confirm if comparison-type of questions should be allowed, like on the example I've given. Though I personally disagree to allow these type of questions since it will arise speculations and opinions from an individual and not from a solid fact from the story itself. An example, "Who is smarter, Light Yagami (Death Note) or Lelouch Vi Britannia (Code Geass)?" That would only trigger user's opinions and answers won't end and there would be no "real answer" for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You should read this: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed to that. I just asked for confirmation.


















No

Asking who is better in some situation is subjective and will lead to arguments for which there is no answer. It's maybe a borderline case if both characters are from the same series, but even then I'm opposed to it unless there's a good reason why we'd expect there to be a definitive answer.

Asking about differences and similarities should also not be allowed. The only exception I would make is if one character is directly based on another, and even then I don't think these make good questions most of the time.

As per the https://anime.stackexchange.com/faqFAQ, questions here should be practical and answerable. This sort of comparison is neither (except in a few exceptional cases), and so we should not allow such questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you give an example of some of "few exceptional cases" that can be considered with regards to comparison-type of questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@xjshiya I honestly can't think of any that are anime-related, though there probably are some. Shog9's link is a good explanation for why these types of questions typically aren't good for a Q&A format.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would always depend on the question's construction. Thanks for the clarifications.


















As i observed https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/27/madara-uchihaMadara Uchiha used in many questions about Madara the first person. Like "stated that I had indeed transplanted" It is referred to Madara and not to himself (I guess he isn't Madara in "real life").

Should we allow the first person as character in questions or answers? It could get out of control once we get a Son-Goku a Vegeta, a Naruto etc.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow the first person writing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It actually started as a joke, but people insisted I keep it up, so I rolled with it. I always include the actual name too ("When Kabuto revived me (Madara Uchiha)"), so that if in the offshot where I change my name, the post is still understandable. Just make sure the backwards compatibility is OK.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even acknowledging that Madara is a badass (not just in the story, but here, and even more so on StackOverflow), why make exceptions for one user? I thought SE is about content and not about users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai This question isn't about making an exception for madara, but in the general "problem"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tartori I wasn't referring to the question, but to the above comment, where Madara said that people encouraged him to keep using first person.


















The question is, whether it confuses readers. The name is written under the message, so I don't have a problem. However, if it gets out of control as you've written, we should forbid it, as new users may be confused.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's exactly what I thought, it could confuse new members and once it got out of control, it'll be a huge amount of work to clean it up. I doubt that Madara is the only one that will be doing it.


















As I read the meta page, I see increasing number of "Should we allow...?" questions.

We're in a phase when we are creating rules about the site. The natural reaction is that we see a question which arises our doubt - seems poorly written, barely on topic, common knowledge, not specific enough - and our reaction is to write a meta asking if we should make a rule regarding this type of questions.

Which is fine and dandy if there's a bunch of the questions like this one really cluttering the site and we are really helping set shape to it.

But if this is a single question unlikely to reappear in another year, we should take a step back. We are creating a rule. Something there to stay, something to be learned by all who want to keep contributing to this site meaningfully.

If we make the corpus of rules too big, very few will ever want to learn it. Important rules will go unnoticed because the user reading a twentieth minor peeve forbidden will just stop reading and trying to remember.

So, before you ask whether given type of questions should be allowed or forbidden, take a step back and consider whether given type of questions is worth being regulated at all.

If they are to appear once a year, maintaining the general rule will be more hassle and introduce more disorder (by making the whole corpus of rules harder to learn) than deciding if the question belongs, ad-hoc and case-by-case.

My suggestion for questions like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/239/should-we-allow-questions-about-the-legality-of-forms-of-anime(1), https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/246/should-we-allow-the-first-person-writing(2), https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/163/is-asking-about-anime-crossovers-off-topic-here(3): leave unregulated.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Creating too many rulesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're right. Too much rules will (and actually in my opinion are) suffocate the community before it come to life. Rules seems to have a bad impact on real-world questions (a minority now) when question about fictitious universe (a majority) are blooming mostly unregulated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For question 2, it is reasonable to want to regulate. Even the one to 'start' the first-person-question-asking admits that it may cause confusion and frustration in the future as this site progresses. As for the other 2, I'm a bit on the fence as you are.


















I understand what you mean, but there are a few things to be considered. 

It's easier to set the rules now then having more people understand them. If they are ready by the time we reach public beta, the site will work better.

Second, the rules can be changed anytime, if deemed necessary. We're not carving anything in stone. Just setting a few parameters that we can always fix later. 

By the way, if a question is not welcome, it should not be welcome even if it comes once a year. If that means having a specific rule, then let's make one. We must not allow questions just because they're rare and so one rule is "a waste"... We need to separate good questions from bad ones. That's our job as a community.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rules are not set in stone but I don't think there are established procedures of removing rarely used and unnecessary rules - moving issues into "unregulated" area. And while I can agree with your sentiment, you going to remember 200 new rules per every site you visit? Are all users going to try to remember them all? A rule is not "a waste" - it's something to be learned. Active effort for all involved. And while one rule is a minor effort, getting 200 users to remember 40 rules (each) is more effort than 15 minutes of discussion once a year if given question pops up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF. The procedure is the same: asking a Meta question. That works both for setting and removing a rule. If the majority accepts, that becomes the new rule. And yes, I remember all the rules more or less, that's because there is a set of rules that is common for all SE sites. And the per-site rules are less in number. But anyways, the FAQ is there to keep track of these rules, you don't need to remember them by memory only.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We have to try to keep both a community of enthusiasts and real-world questions before we reach public beta. Following the trend of the last days, enthusiasts will pop off as fast as their real world questions are closed without any real suggestion on how to improve or reformulate these. Please consider the general interest, keeping a SE site appealing to experts of specific topics.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF. Are you seriously suggesting there's going to be 200 rules? There will be 10/15 at worse for this specific site. :P That's not hard to remember, and if it is, users can read the FAQ. We're not supposed to make less rules just because users can't remember them. Remember: what will make this site succeed is the order. Chaos will drive users away.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno: If there are 10-15, that's fine. I'm trying to prevent a situation when there's 200. We are only a few first days into private beta and we already have about a dozen with new ones suggested daily.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF. Yes, but most of them can be grouped in a single one. If we're really creating too many and above all unnecessary rules, I'll be there to say no as well. You did well to ask, by the way, no-one should shut up as we're here to discuss. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno: Thank you. I just thought it would be worth bringing to attention of the community that besides "yes" and "no", "unregulated" -is- a valid option too.


















There are a couple of points you need to consider.

First of all, most new users do not care about these at all, and a lot of them don't know what meta is/that meta exists. They will ask questions regardless of the rules we make or do not make here.

Second, each rule has exceptions. Of course if we agreed that "questions X should be forbidden", and then, once in a while, an absolutely awesome question of type X arrives, it is not going to be closed just like that. It's the spirit of the law that's important here, not it's letter.

Third, the rules are not set in stone, that's why we have this: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discussiondiscussion. Don't like something? Feel free to discuss. 

Fourth, all those clarification posts "should we allow XXX" are really not for those new users who have just come to the site to post those questions. They are for us, more experienced users. They are there to help us understand whether or not a particular question should be closed, or how to act if a specific question appears. Note that most of the times these discussions end with common sense winning.

So yeah, don't take them too serious, just use them as guidelines when you are not sure how to act with a particular question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, "They are for us, more experienced users." And once you have too many, you'll start getting lost. An interesting question will get closed because some discussion on a single, horribly written question on similar subject led to decision this family of questions should be forbidden, and then you're jumping through hoops to overturn the closure against the established rule... While I completely agree with the notion "use them as guidelines", not all feel that way about them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF., I personally trust in the community enough to believe that a really interesting question is not going to be closed like that. Of course, having 1000 discussions like "omg should we allow questions about XXX douhinshi?" sucks. But if you look on other SE sites, there are a lot of meta discussions concerning even if some one particular question is on topic. I don't think such questions will be in large enough numbers to do any harm. That's my personal opinion, though, I may of course be wrong.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want your faith in "not closing interesting questions" shaken visit meta.english.seb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with clarification posts being just for more experienced users. If a new user has a valid point, that's great and I hope they post it. How will new users ever become "experienced" if they are shunned from meta?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza, by "experienced" I was meaning to "experienced with the stackexchange". Of course, it's only good when new users come with interesting questions and opinions. I was just saying that most people who is completely new to stackexchange don't know about what meta sites are for, and how they work. And of course I don't want them to be "shunned" from meta.


















I don't think we should leave it unregulated. You are right, these questions maybe won't appear again, but if they do, it isn't bad that there's a discussion about the topic + an explanation. A new user doesn't need to read them all, therefore we have a FAQ.

For everything else, read the other answers, they were too fast for me ;).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A new, responsible, welcome user should read the FAQ. Whole FAQ. Make the FAQ too long and that won't be happening.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF. I think I should reword my answer; these discussed "rules" *should not* appear in the FAQ. The discussion should be the only place where it is, so there's no problem in my eyes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@looper The site-specific rules should appear (even if in concise form) on the FAQ... The FAQ is there for that reason. We can always expand on Meta if things get bigger. :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno: I just thought that leaving the really specific questions on meta (like these SF. posted) and just putting the real important rules in the FAQ would be the most organized way. Maybe I'm just wrong :D.


















I think that as long as the answer/reference is correct, and the name of the poster is accurate (like in Madara-sama's case), there is nothing wrong with it, and it's fun to read. 

I'd like to point this out once again: it only works if it's used in good answers/questions with correct data. As soon as a newly-registered Naruto will start stating that during his trainings with Jiraiya he was faking the inability to create Resengan Minato-style (i.e. easily, without preparation and with one hand), that answer/question/comment should be dealt with.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is  obvious, all answers with wrong content should be handled whether it's written in first or third person.

  Appointed ♦ Moderator Pro Tempore on Linguistics SE, Chinese SE and the Russian SE site




Thanks for the nomination. Before the Nominations started I said that since I already was (am) a mod on three sites, I would leave the others first and that I would only step up if I was needed (i.e. a third name was needed). I still think so. 

I greatly appreciate the trust and I think I'll like spending time on this site and its community. I don't hide I'd like to help actively being a mod, nevertheless, leaving others trying this experience is the right thing to do (I even nominated two other users). Ultimately the Team will decide and they probably know better, but I had to say this again.

In any case, I accept the nomination, if my participation will be deemed necessary.

There are a lot of different types of comics, and it should be made clear how manga is defined  here. What should be the criteria for something to be manga and, as such, on topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should manga be defined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, do we allow questions on manhwa or manhua?


















Absolutely yes. Many manga authors like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumomo_YumekaSumomo Yumeka started from doujinshi and then became professionals mangaka. Ignoring these works would mean splitting these authors in two, the professional and the amateur, disallowing questions about part of their career.

Questions about doujinshi are probably more difficult to answer to, because of availability of the doujinshi itself, but an a priori prohibition would be counterproductive.

Great answer!


















Another user started to refer to himself using the first person. He then changed it but — and I'm not speaking about the user, just taking it as an example — I think this might get out of hand in the long run, so I came to think that...

...we should forbid it.

Comments are borderline IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Chat is chat: the limits are much less strict there, so if someone wants to impersonate a Manga character or a rock, it's fine. :P Comments are still too related to the Main site, so I'd keep the first person out of there too.


















In terms of audience, graphic novels appear to be on-topic. Most any store I go to to buy manga will have graphic novels nearby. That said, it will also likely share a wall or a storefront with Marvel and so forth.


How should scope be defined around graphic novels? 
Is the limiting factor the presentation style or culture-based?
What is the difference between graphic novels and manga in terms of audience, and does that matter to scoping the site?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are graphic novels on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How are Graphic Novels defined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SF.That is the point of the question for me. Some Graphic Novels will be very much from the style of an anthology of collected, serialized Western style comics (see Wipqozn's answer), whereas others (see Chirale's answer) will refer to a different scope. A useful answer to this question will help to define what a graphic novel actually is, and how it does/n't fit into the knowledge base of this community


















No, graphic novels should not be on-topic. Comics such as Watchmen, Batman, Bone, et cetera are not manga, and should thus be ruled off-topic. See this related meta here: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/265/how-should-manga-be-definedHow should manga be defined? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am not talking about serialized comics. By graphic novel I would be referring to the works of novels like Jimmy Corrigan, Black Hole, Ed the Happy Clown and works that do not exist in the canon you appear to be referring to


















Jiro Taniguchi and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_GiraudMoebius (a French artist recently passed away) worked together to make http://www.nonsolomanga.it/manga4/taniguchi_icaro.htmIcare. This can be called a graphic novel and a manga and this is absolutely on-topic. Not all graphics novels are Western comics, there are even important collaborations from a Japanese artist and a Western artist like this. 

Agreeing to a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/266/98by origin definition or a by https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/189/98external reference definition (here about anime) will solve this question, because excluding graphic novels will be ambiguous as ambiguous is the definition of "graphic novels": a more "literary" and appealing term for comics or manga, but not a term to distinguish between manga (Japanese comics) and comics (Western comics).

In answering this question, graphic novels should not be excluded because many manga could be defined as graphic novels.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We would just have to be careful if we go with what you're saying to make it clear that only graphic novels that count as manga by other agreed on definitions are allowed. We can't allow all graphic novels indiscriminately just because some are manga.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can't allow the usage of the term "graphic novel" in any rule, because it's too vague. Manga in the first place is not a style, is the Japanese term for "comics". Graphic novel are another term for comics (and, trust me, there are many comics artists that ridicule this term because it's self-celebrating or worst) but without the origin constraint that "manga" has in the Western usage of the term. So, here, it's not a useful term, only a troublesome one.


















Since "anime" and "manga" tags are blacklisted, light-novel should be blacklisted as well since it serves the same purpose
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Add "light-novel" to tag blacklistb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where is it stated they were blacklisted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/18/ Note the status tag and Shoq9's response to Robert's answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah thanks. :) I didn't see it.


















Since "anime" and "manga" tags are blacklisted, "movie" should be blacklisted as well since it either serves the same purpose or overlaps with the usage of "variations"

I think we should define "manga" as comics fit one or more of the following:


Comics created to target the Japanese as the primary audience
Comics (originally) created/published in Japan (including self-published works), this includes comics adapted from non-Japanese source material (E.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman%3a_Child_of_DreamsBatman: Child of Dreams)
Comics serialized by a reputable publisher, E.g. Kondansha
Comics that have received an nationally (Japan) or international award (for non-serialized comics), or by a legitimate and reputable panel of judges. E.g., http://www.manga-award.jp/en/International Manga Award


The line gets a bit hazy when we a dealing with self-published works (including doujinshi) by non-Japanese authors outside Japan, typically these works are NOT considered manga, despite similiar styles and themes. But there are http://www.manga-award.jp/img/en/5thaward/goldikillglants.pdfexceptions to these http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-07-10/kodansha-to-publish-megatokyo-in-japanOriginal English Language manga.

Such cases do not seem to be a frequent occurrence, so we can deal with them on a case by case bases. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Add to your list applicants to [International Manga Awards](http://www.manga-award.jp/en/award_6th.html). For example, this [circle of authors](http://fattoremanga.blogspot.it/) in Italy republished in the number 0 of their fanzine the works them submitted to that contest, printing these works in the original RTL order. So, the number 0 could be considered manga or it's in a grey area that's best to [leave unregulated](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/249/98).


















TL;DR

No, it's not okay. I vote for forbidding it.



I originally started it as a joke. When I stopped, people urged me to continue, so I did.

Now that the site has gone public, I will cease to do it, because it serves as a bad example for our new users.

Things will get really out of hand really quick, when we'll have 10 Naruto's each asknig questions about themselves.

So from this point onwards, I will stop asking questions in first-person tone, and I expect others to do the same.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wow, people urged you to continue and they downvoted me to stop! Seriously, what's wrong with people? Pick one thing or the other, and stay consistent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai: Well, it was funny when we were small and private. But it will get out of hand when we go to public. Also, the reason for downvotes was because your question was very subjective.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha If you're not writing in first person anymore and the community has decided to disallow it on top of that, you might want to/probably should go back and edit your older posts if you haven't already to keep them consistent with the new style and to avoid leaving ["broken windows"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Anna will do. Thanks.


















I posted a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/should-we-have-an-anime-specific-tagcounter-proposal a little while back which got very little discussion on either side of the argument. In my opinion, we got rid of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga not because they were bad tags, but because they were bad descriptors of what the tags were actually used for and hence were overused. If we used https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-specificanime-specific and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-specificmanga-specific then there would be no problem. Likewise https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novellight-novel should be changed to be https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novel-specificlight-novel-specific rather than deleted.

I'm not sure I still care strongly about this either way, but I'm posting this as an answer to gauge the opinion of the community and in case anyone else does feel strongly that we should keep this tag.



The above now seems obsolete. This tag is only used on https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/162/24one question, and that question doesn't particularly need it. Rather than blacklisting, which should be avoided except in cases of repeated abuse (because it requires SE involvement), I think it's reasonable just to delete the tag from that question. If anyone feels strongly that this tag should exist, and can come up with a good argument for why, feel free to edit it back into the relevant questions, but please provide an answer here or somewhere else on meta as to why you think so.

What questions are considered on-topic for this site?

This meta has some discussions on whether an exact type of questions is on topic. They can be easily found by https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=off-topicthis simple search. 

An interesting question will always be welcomed and up-voted on the site (as long as it stays on-topic, of course). If the question makes people think "hell, that's a nice one! How could I have not thought of this question before?", then its usually a good one ;)

Can you name some reasons that may lead to my question being closed?

Apart from off-topic questions, there are some other kinds of questions that you should avoid:


questions that can be answered by the first link when googling for it's exact title

"Who is the main character of Naruto anime?" is probably not a good one.
questions that are duplicates

Try to do just a simple search before asking the question. Searching works well on this site, and duplicate questions will certainly be closed. Save yourself some time!
questions show no effort from the asker, but require a lot of effort to answer.

This may be debatable, but I think that most of the users will not like it. Imagine a question like "How many times did Naruto use Rasengan in the manga?", which is phrased something like "Hi guys, I love Naruto and I want to know how many times did he use Rasengan to make a wall poster". This question shows no research effort from the user - basically he just wants us to do all the work. It also requires quite some effort to answer, because it will likely force the answerer to re-check a lot of manga chapters and spend a lot of time to answer it. Do at least some basic research so we know that you are really interested in the answer and will appreciate it!
questions that can't be answered, or can't be answered with facts

Questions like "when will the third season of Spice and Wold anime appear?" are not allowed, because we simply do not know, and we can not possibly know. Same goes for "why did they do it this way?" questions. 

Ideally, the answers must be supported by facts taken from official sources. Questions that can be answered only by speculation, and can not be supported by facts, are likely to be closed as not constructive.
questions that are ambiguous, or hard to understand

People need to know what you are asking about, in order to make an answer. Try to phrase your questions in an unambiguous way, and to make them as clear and concise as possible.


How do I make a good title for my question?

Each question starts with a title, and a title is what people see first. A title should concisely tell us what the question is about, and be concise at the same time. This is hard to achieve sometimes, and you will have to find some kind of a golden mean. The title must be able to "catch" people, and make them go inside your question. It also should not leave them confused. 


Example:
Take a look at https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/278/is-no-face-from-spirited-away-based-on-any-traditional-japanese-legendsthis question, entitled "Is No Face from Spirited Away based on any traditional Japanese legends?". It is a fairly good title. It immediately brings you to the point, while not being too long. It also suggests that there might be an extended question explanation inside. Now imagine if it was called, for example, "What is No Face's origin?". This is an example of a worse title, which is too vague. For example, by reading it, one can't really guess what "origin" means. It can mean a real-world prototype, or where did No Face come from plot-wise, or how did it appear, or something else.


Also note that a title should not contain spoilers! This is very important, it's hard to express how frustrating it is to be spoiled about a character death (or something similar) by a bad-written question title.

Can I ask a "what-if" question, or make a poll or a voting list?

This site is for questions that can be answered exactly and reasonably. Questions like "who would win, Madara or Byakuya?" are forbidden, because they only cause debate and will never be answered. Save them for chats and forums.

As for the list questions, they are allowed if they meet the following criteria:


They are specific and to the point. Don't ask about list of abstract concepts or anime series featuring some theme.
The list items can be determined objectively. Don't ask about a list of our favorite things, or things we think are "good".
The list is reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire wiki-page listing your answer, the question is not reasonably scoped.
The list isn't prone to rapid change. If the list is hard to maintain, it won't be, thus losing its usefulness.


If your question meets all those, feel free to ask it.

How do I make my question look better?

Formatting the question is very easily done in the editor, it doesn't require a lot of time, but makes a question much better and easy to read and understand.

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/editing-helpAt this page you can find some help about using the editor. A notable, but often missed feature is spoiler markup, which look like this:


   This is a spoiler.


To add a spoiler, use the following markup: 

>! spoiler-text-goes-here

Note that there should be an empty line before the spoiler for the markup to work.

Anything else I should know?

Do not ask the question and leave it alone. 

I've seen it a lot of times on different SE sites: a user asks a question, and then leaves for a long time. Other users leave a lot of comments asking for clarification, but don't get any response, which sometimes prevents them from answering the question. Of course I'm not forcing you to monitor your question 24/7, but at least take a look on it once in a while after you posted it. 

Try to check your grammar. 

Of course, for many of us (maybe most of us) English is not a native language and we all understand that. However, if you will try to check the grammar in your question before posting it, it will be appreciated. Most modern browsers have spell-checking mechanisms. Some info about it can be found http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spellchecking#Using_a_web_browserat this wikipedia page.

I agree that the "movie" tag should be blacklisted.  If users are asking questions that are specific to a movie then they're likely going to mention the name of the movie in the title or content of the question.

I used the movie tag on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/430/when-does-the-deadzone-movie-take-place-in-the-dbz-storylinethis question and even looking back at that question, the tag wasn't needed and I'll be removing it now.

I think it is very important that we allow only Manga references in the answers to any questions. I think that wiki references tend to loose context of the situation where the information came from. This may even lead to pple starting to answer with really unreliable sources as references and this might get the site credibility to decline. Thus, I think all the references should be from Manga/anime and not wikis

But all in all, the above is all my own opinion.

Thus, I ask you:

should wiki references be allowed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5should wiki references be allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Isn't the reason of making a wiki to have a reliable source? So if the wiki *is* reliable, why not? It's the purpose of the wiki, if I'm not mistaken.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5a wiki may be reliable but it just answers a lot more related questions when the chapter reference is provided. All that is missed when a wiki reference is provided that does not included chapter references


















There's nothing wrong with referencing any source you may find, and think that is credible. Whether you, the OP, accepts it as one, is your business.

If you wish for manga reference, ask the answerer politely in the comments to include them. If he does not oblige, do not accept his answer. It's as simple as that.

The wiki, from which the reference in question is taken, is (in my eyes) a relatively credible source, as it's regularly updated and maintained.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And the wiki often presents manga references itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and how do innocent bystanders benefit from this? I have'nt asked the question but I want to know where the info came from. What do I do?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MozenRath: The information came from the wiki. Which by itself is a reliable source of information. Often, the wiki itself contains reference to manga chapter/pages too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you don't understand, wiki's state facts plainly many a times and in those situations it gets really difficult to trust them. I think manga references are most satiable for anybodyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I mean  `senju hashirama died naming is bro as the next hokage` but where hell did they say that in the manga. Ok wiki may be right but when was that revealed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MozenRath It's mentioned in the [first Naruto databook](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Rin_no_Sho). The wiki usually cite the source of relevant information such as this. That is how you can factcheck the references to make sure they are accurate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ok so are you saying that most of them have references planted on the links?


















Even if you have a reference from the original source, a wiki reference is useful because it can be directly linked to (for verification and to provide extra background). In contrast, there's no reliable way to hyperlink to a specific point in a cartoon.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5that is not necessarily true. It all depends on the the question. I do agree that some times it might happen that a wiki proves to be a better reference. but even during that situation, without the references from original chapters, it makesd me wonder how and when that particular fact was revealed. Forgive me If you think am asking for too much...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MozenRath: How do you expect to hyperlink it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well you don't, all readers know where they their manga's from and should have access to them. That is the problem of the OP. I don't think you can ask a question without reading the manga


















I personally think they are Ok. Consider the following: 


Wikis are collaboratively edited, so they usually will not allow wrong data to be posted
most wikis have their own references to the sources (chapters/episodes)
It may take way too long to find references yourself. Sometimes I remember that something has happened, but can't remember in what exact chapter/episode did it happen. In this case, it's obviously impossible to recheck all of the chapters or episodes.
If the poster of the question accepts the answer, it means that he/she is satisfied, no matter what the sources were.
If you want exact references in a question you ask, feel free to explicitly state it, and not to accept any answers without them. 
If you think some answer is missing references, you can always leave a comment asking the author to add the. 

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5y not paste the chapter no instead of the wiki in the answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MozenRath, if the reference is there, there is no reason not to paste it. But referencing the wiki too would be fair, I think.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ohhk based on all the answers I have come realize the importance of wiki references, BUT only the wiki references that include chapter references would make sense. Then comes the problem of differentiating the two....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MozenRath, it's more about people than wikis. For example if I see that a wiki is missing a reference, i try to find it myself. Some people might do that too, and some will just post a wiki reference and leave it like that.


















Two things the FAQ should add:


Recommendation charts: Based on popularity, genre and demographic. There are many examples (http://images.wikia.com/animu-mango/images/8/89/1266460057179.jpgthis and http://images.wikia.com/animu-mango/images/7/70/1262839877207.jpgthis) that allow people to see some wide variety of titles before asking what to watch.
Season X tag: Mainly to avoid getting a lot of new tags, maybe having a specific tag per season would allow people to find about new shows that are currently airing.


This two small things would help a lot to filter repetitive posts or maybe issues for new shows.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, it's exactly the place to propose it. That's the purpose of this question. People post answers based on what they think the faq should contain, and people vote on it. @Loganb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha You're right that this is the right place to post this; I misinterpreted the question (I blame Christmas). However, my downvote still stands. I don't think we should be in the business of recommending anime, whether it's on the FAQ or the main site, and especially not with something as unprofessional as a 4chan chart. I'd be less opposed to linking to something that's more professional-looking and democratic, e.g. ANN's top 50 list: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/ratings-anime.php?top50=best_bayesianb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM That chart was just an example, there are several sites that contain this type of charts or recommendations. I just quote that as an example, because it contains many mainstream anime titles in several categories and in different times which may give more options than charts based on ratings.


















Tags on other sites do not strictly conform to the "series" equivalents.

While Stack Overflow does have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/phpphp, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++ and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pythonpython, it also has https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gitgit, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/formsforms and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/displaydisplay. Each of this do not strictly relate to any specific programming language (or in our case, series), but they do provide helpful information about the question.

After all, that's what tags are for, if we wanted series only tags, we would have to call them "categories", don't you think?

I don't consider https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology a meta tag for instance. A meta tag is a tag which describes the question, and not the content of the question. An example for a meta tag is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spoilersspoilers, which doesn't give me any indication on what the content of the question is, but only tells me it has spoilers (which make it a bad tag).

I would agree though, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plot-explanationplot-explanation seems redundant, as by default, that's what I as a read/answerer assumes the question is about. It is also on the border of meta-tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure about if [tag:plot-explanation] is redundant. Among the front page questions, quite a large number are asking about things that are not plot-related (like http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/734/). There is a definite difference between that question and, say, http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/26. On the other hand, the tag has definitely not been applied consistently (http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/537 never should have gotten that tag). IMO we should try to find a more self-explanatory name for the tag first, and if that fails we can kill it.


















I think the question:


  This "sickness" has anything to do with Pantherlily becoming his "cat" ?


Is more answerable than the general "why". But even so, it could still just be speculation.

This problem will come up when possible plot-related questions pop up for shows/series that are ongoing. Unless the OP simply missed something that has happened, the answer is usually "nobody knows (yet)". Personally, I don't see a problem with leaving these questions open until an answer is revealed. It would be easier than closing the question and waiting for it to be re-opened, or asking a duplicate question. If there isn't an answer yet, nobody should give an answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I took part of your text and changed the title =)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"If there isn't an answer yet, nobody should give an answer." imo you should bold this. I definitely agree that "nobody knows" shouldn't be an answer for ongoing series. If the series ended and there really is no answer, that's fine. But don't do it for ongoing stuff.


















The thing is, the OP cannot know that there is no answer yet (unless he's doing it on purpose). So we can't, nor should we punish him by downvoting or closing his question.

As for "temporarily closing the question".


Not practical. Forget about it.
Why? Since the question is going to be answerable one way or another (Either the detail is revealed later in the series, and then we can answer it, or it isn't revealed at all, and the series ends, in which case the correct answer is


  It wasn't revealed.


As small as that is, it is an answer.


For those reasons, I don't see a reason to close the question, and prevent it from being answered in the future (Again, no one is going to remember to open them up). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Basically, any question (that can't be assured to be on purpose.) that ask about something that doesn't exist at the moment, should be treated like this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MichelAyres: If it doesn't exist *at this moment*, then yes. It should be kept open. Maybe even answer a CW about how it wasn't revealed yet. If the show ended, and the question remains unanswerable, it can be closed.


















Some anime and manga series have multiple continuities, such as Fullmetal Alchemist (the manga and Brotherhood follow the same story while the original was only partly based on the manga) and Evangelion (the Rebuild continuity has strayed completely from the original anime, and the manga is completely different also).

I read through https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212/should-we-have-separate-tags-for-the-dragon-ball-seriesthis question, but it mostly covers multiple tags for different parts of the same continuity.

So, what I wonder is: Should we have tags for each separate continuity? Such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhoodfullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood; https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rebuild-of-evangelionrebuild-of-evangelion; and so on? https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/88/274This answer seemed to suggest we should, but no changes have been made to questions pertaining to FMA: Brotherhood; should they be?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should multiple continuities have individual tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5related: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/84/should-minimalistic-tags-and-synomoms-be-used-for-anime-with-different-series/88#88b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SingerOfTheFall Yup, I already linked that in my post, but thanks! :)


















For Fullmetal Alchemist, having separate tags for fullmetal-alchemist and fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood would get really confusing. Fullmetal Alchemist (the 2005 anime) is different from Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but Fullmetal Alchemist (the manga) is essentially the same as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, so that will lead to a lot of problems. As said in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/222/regarding-tag-sprawl?lq=1Regarding tag sprawl, it can just be clarified in the question which one is being asked about. 

For Neon Genesis Evangelion, and in general, I think having a policy of fewer-is-better should be used when regarding tags. It can be clarified in a question what is being asked about, just as it can be clarified whether a manga or an anime is being asked about.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would have no problem having *Brotherhood* and the manga as synonyms, since their differences are minimal. However, it helps people who are looking for specific *Brotherhood* information, as it would in the *Rebuild* canon. I'm personally thinking these should be treated as different stories entirely. Unfortunately, aside from a quick "mention" in that thread you posted, it doesn't seem to be discussed much.

   This is the first paragraph of a spoiler block.

 This is the second paragraph.

Anyway, avoid making huge spoiler blocks. Put into the spoiler only the relevant bit. We need searchable questions.

I think the answer here is "it depends".

Are the very significant differences between the versions of the series? Plot-wise? Character-wise?

In the case of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist, yes, there are. However, because the manga is called Fullmetal Alchemist, while the "original" anime is called Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I'd argue it would make more sense to have a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist for the manga and brotherhood, and a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-2003fullmetal-alchemist-2003, for the 2003 series.

However, these cases should be handled on a case-to-case basis. If the variations are fundamentally different, yes. There should a different tag for it. Where the most "popular" tag (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist is considered more popular than https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-2003fullmetal-alchemist-2003 in this context) goes to the canonical, official series.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree here, though I hadn't even thought of that point about the "official" canon. The problem is in something like *Evangelion* in which multiple continuities are canon and official. We'd need tags like *neon-genesis-evangelion*, *neon-genesis-evangelion-manga*, and *rebuild-of-evangelion*.


















The Area 51 averages are calculated over the last 2 weeks. Hover over any statistic in Area 51 for details:


  "4.8 questions per day on average over the past two weeks"


I wouldn't worry about it too much. The holiday season is typically painfully slow for sites in general. But you should not be dwelling or agonizing over these numbers in any case, particularly so early in your development. From here on out, that's not your job.

The task at hand is to compile a great collection of knowledge on this subject. That's about it. That means asking intriguing questions when you have them, really knocking out (and constantly improving) some great answers where you can, and to http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/vote early and often… to encourage better answers and to recognize and motivate those who contribute their hard-earned knowledge and experience here. There's some http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/meta governance that goes with keeping the site moving in the right direction, but that's about all there is to it.

Those Area 51 stats do not represent some sort of “report card” filled with pass/fail grades. That's not how it works. You're only concern should be to provide a great end-user experience to those who come here for help. Planning specifically how you are going to optimize those numbers usually leads to unwanted behaviors — usually to the detriment of the site. Just focus on quality, and the numbers will follow.

Have a look at the blog post below. Hopefully it will put those numbers — and how little they actually mean as an end goal — into perspective:

There was a lot of lead time in preparation of this year's Winter Bash event, including the coordination of 90+ sites for discussion of whether they wanted to opt in or not.

I've noticed certain https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/878/63answers link to external manga readers. Many of these manga readers make their money off pageviews and ad-content. I don't think we should be directing traffic to these sites.

Should we remove them and add a reference to the chapter and page(s), rehost these image(s) on Imgur, or do something else?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we handle links to external manga readers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Walking a tightrope there - there *may* be free webcomics out there that are freely and readily available to peruse online, just not in English.

It's a bad idea, simply because a new user doesn't know how the system works. He doesn't know what is the accepted format for tags in Stack Exchange in general.

Even a user who's active on another site (And thus gets a 100 point bonus), doesn't know what the accepted tag scheme on this specific site is.

If a user wants a question tagged with a specific anime which doesn't exist, the expected behavior is:


Find a tag which closely matches what he wants
Either wait for a retag by a high-rep user.
Even better, flag the question for retagging by a moderator.


I understand the system is problematic, but allowing new users to arbitrarily add tags induces more problems than it would solve.

It's not really slang but the problem with it is that it makes all questions look the same... We should encourage choosing other wordings.

The best way to do that is editing the questions when they come up. :) Forcing is not feasible and it's better to educate. It'll be slower but will give more results in the long term.

Also, it does sound a bit like slang, like stand-up comedy shows "What's up with that?!"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha There are examples of the same wording in other sites too, by the way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That doesn't make it right, you know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Right"...

We had the same problem with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hell-singhell-sing: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/210/request-for-tag-hell-sing-to-be-converted-to-hellsingRequest for tag hell-sing to be converted to hellsing. The solution is to remove https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xxx-holicxxx-holic from all of the questions, wait a little bit until https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xxx-holicxxx-holic is removed from the system, and then retag them all with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xxxholicxxxholic. There's probably an easier way for moderators to do this, but we don't have pro temp mods yet.

For now, I've retagged all of the questions with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/holicholic. I've also saved the old tag wiki for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xxx-holicxxx-holic. Once the system deletes https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xxx-holicxxx-holic they can be retagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xxxholicxxxholic (I'll check back in a few hours if no one else fixes it before then), and I'll put the tag wiki back for the new tag.

Edit: I've replaced the interim tag with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xxxholicxxxholic, so this should be resolved now. Tag wiki description will be back up once my edit gets peer reviewed.

There's an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-identificationanime-identification tag but no corresponding one for identifying manga. It does seem, to me at least, that manga identification requests are significantly rarer than ones for anime, but I do regularly see requests for identification from an image of a panel or a page from a manga (on other anime/manga related sites). Should there be a separate tag for manga identification or should there be a single tag which covers identification of anime, manga, light novels, or whatever else? Also, it seems one of the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/1952/what-is-the-song-played-in-cool-device-11-fallen-angel-rinaquestions that's using this tag is requesting an identification of a song, and not of an anime, which leads me to think a more general "identification" type of tag would work better.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the "anime-identification" tag be modified so that it applies to manga as well?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 [Tag:Identification] would be better and isn't too broad.


















I would vote against https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identificationidentification, because it's exactly too broad. This way, it can be used to identify anything:


anime/manga by description
anime/manga by screenshot
music
characters
places (e.g. "what place was a prototype for the setting of anime X?")
anything within the anime/manga, here are just a couple of random examples I can think of:


What brand of T-shirts did character X use in manga Y?
What is this food character X is eating in anime Y?
...and so on.

It says that it is awarded to those who've "Actively participated in the private beta.".
I'd say some of us have done that, but none have been awarded the badge.

Is this some bug, or did we not actively participate in private beta?

EDIT
I don't mean to be a pain in the ass, but shouldn't the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/badges/30/betabadge have been awarded here on meta too?

If you are like me, the majority of manga (not so much anime) I read are on hiatus. 
But, is asking about the production off-topic?

What do you mean by upcoming, or hiatus manga/anime?

'Hiatus' means that production of the manga/anime is paused, and will be resumed at a later date. Some manga, like NANA, Highschool of the Dead and D.N.Angel (and many others, I'm sure) are on hiatus and have not been updated in such a long time it's almost easy to assume they won't ever be updated.

Alternatively, if a manga-ka has announced that their manga is going to be made into an upcoming anime or if a manga-ka has said that he/she is making another manga series - it would be considered to be upcoming in production. The point I'm getting to about upcoming anime/manga is: is it OK to ask about key aspects or dates of the release of a particular anime/manga?

How could this be on-topic?

It seems like questions relating to the production of anime could be on-topic for the following reasons:


The subject is directly linked to Anime/Manga
The answers can be factual and have details about the plot (that can be used for future reference etc.)
For an anime and manga Q&A site, it seems reasonable to ask about upcoming manga and anime.


Example questions:


  
  Does anyone know when [title] will resume production?  
  Is this [title] discontinued, and why?  
  When is [title] going to be released as an anime?  
  Will [title] become an anime?  
  


Thanks :)

A lot of anime are, inarguably, quite graphic. Many sport blood, open flesh wounds, nudity, and several other "mature" themes. Now, in order to effectively illustrate some answers, detailed written descriptions or images must be provided. https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2076/274This is one such question, which contains graphic imagery of the aftereffects of severe bite wounds.

Do other StackExchange sites have policies on this? If so, what are they, and should we adhere to them? To what extent do we allow such images?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How graphic is too graphic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To add my own $0.02: I believe we should be allowing anything which does not contain explicit nudity, though I'm not against linking to those off-site with a warning attached.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep. I was slightly hesitant to post that image. And I'll gladly pull it if it bothers anyone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial As I state in my answer below, if you're hesitant about a graphic image, but want to use it, a nice compromise is to spoiler-tag the images with a warning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I didn't consider either of those images to be disturbing at all - but possibly to others. So I didn't bother to hide it. But for anything that's much worse, I would've hid it behind a link with a clear warning.


















I don't know what the policy is on other SE sites, but if there's a network-wide policy on graphic images we should follow that. My answer is basically the same as Eric's comment, but I made an answer so that it could be voted on.

I don't think we should be worried about graphic violence in images posted here. The only people who will read the question and answer linked to are users here or people who google for something related to Highschool of the Dead. In the former case, SE requires all users to be at least 13, and generally a user here should know that HOTD is a fairly graphic series if they intend to click on the question. In the latter case, anyone searching HOTD is sure to have seen plenty of graphic content related to the series, so we shouldn't be worried about that either. If you have especially graphic or disturbing images, a spoiler tag could be used with a warning, but I don't think we should require it in general.

Nudity should not be allowed, mostly because it's unprofessional and usually unnecessary. Some people may check this site from work computers, so any NSFW sexual content should not be shown. SE has a http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policypolicy banning sexually explicit and pornographic material, which of course is a bit ambiguous. I'd lean on the safe side here and say that anything questionable should not be directly posted here.

The SE policy above explicitly includes links to sexually explicit content or pornography. I personally have no problem with people linking to NSFW content with an appropriate warning if it is absolutely necessary to ask/answer the question (and if it's an acceptable question). But until an SE employee clarifies this, even if you are not violating our site's policy, you may be violating SE global policy. I doubt you'd be banned for that if you are legitimately using the site properly, but I don't know for sure so tread with caution.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 I think this most accurately sums up my view on the matter; thanks, Logan!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I generally agree with you, though I think that nudity can be allowed in very specific examples. http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/849/where-do-sagas-pants-come-from is one such example where the nudity is an integral part of the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly I'm specifically talking about content which is sexual in nature and is likely to violate internet use policies for many organizations. If the image is censored, like the above case, then I don't think there's any problem with it. I was a bit hesitant to even mention nudity at all, because one could argue that anime is an art form and any reputable art site will have at least some nudity. However, from a practical standpoint, we shouldn't allow it with absolutely no conditions because many organizations will penalize even for inadvertent access to NSFW content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That was I figured, but I just thought a distinction should be made.


















I disagree with having a tag that only functions in the presence of another tag.


No one wants to follow/ignore "anime-specific", and if they do, it's probably being misused. They might want to follow/ignore https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gasaraki-mangagasaraki-manga, but not https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-specificmanga-specific. The -specific tags are a symptom of an unwillingness to massively (and confusingly) expand the tag list, but still a desire to subdivide them.
They are not actually meta-tags, but they suffer from most of the same problems. The categories are too big, and they don't specifically relate to the item in question. Adding tags that only work in concert with the other tags is not a good idea.
To someone who is new to the site, which is more likely? Immediately realizing that they should add https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-specificanime-specific or asking "In the anime foo, did the biz work because of baz?". Even for cases where it's appropriate to use, the title or opening line is a better way to distinguish the preference for a particular type of answer.

There isn't a clear Stack Exchange policy on the matter, so the subject is rather patchy.

In my eyes we shouldn't limit users to question about more graphical anime, and even plain hentai, as they both fall into the category of this site.

Graphical images (even mildly) rarely have use in this site, but as with all other images, it should only be allowed if it is relevant to the post in question.

We should probably also add to our FAQ that the site may contain mature content.

A tag has many purposes.


The most popular tag of a question will appear in its title, which helps SEO. 
Tags help navigate the site. 
Tags have pages to describe about them, providing background on the subject. 


A tag is less useful then, if it appears on most of the questions on the site. 

For instance, if I ask about how Sakura is so strong, it would make more sense to have "https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto" as a keyword in the title, and not "https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/characterscharacters". 

Searching by the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/characterscharacters would yield no real results. 

Last but not least, there won't be a constructive, helpful tag wiki for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/characterscharacters. 

I want to hear the community's opinion about this. What do you think? Should we keep the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/characterscharacters tag? Should we burn it to ashes? 

Applying the same logic, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-abilitiescharacter-abilities, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variationsvariations and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/opening-songsopening-songs all should burn. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The characters tag, good or bad?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One more use of tags: filtering questions. Some users set favorite/ignored tags, which determines how such questions are displayed on the main page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, which again doesn't help [tag:characters] much.


















I hadn't thought about it like that, but it makes sense.

I read https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/32041/208518this post where it says:  


  Tags are for sorting your question into specific, well-defined categories. Each tag should by itself refer to a specific category. If a tag only makes sense when used in combination with another tag (like '2005' with sql-server, 'visual' with 'studio', or '3.5' with .net), it's a bad tag.  


But in the same logic the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-abilitiescharacter-abilities tag should be treated in the same way, right?  

In the same post, it is also said that:  


  Tags are not for indexing your question. This isn't audio or video. Stack Overflow and Google can index your question just fine based on the text of your question itself. 


And  


  Tags connect experts with questions they will be able to answer.  


As far as I know, there aren't any 'characters' experts. Perhaps you can be an 'expert' in some specific series' characters, but not in characters in general.

So according to that logic: yeah, it should be burnt to ashes!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"character-abilities" might be useful in determining questions specifically about different character abilities versus plot explanations. I.e., I want to know more about jutsus certain shinobi use, but I'm not as interested in the plot behind it. Some what like someone asking a jQuery question would include "jquery" with "javascript"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But maybe that can be specified in-question. No?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it depends on how many of these types of question (as they specifically ask about the mechanics of a character's abilities) we get... (which I expect we might) if we do get a lot of them, if might help to have this tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand and agree that it allows for a better indexing system, but I am not sure if tags are supposed to do that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we should wait and see how things pan out. We can use already established SEs are role models, but we shouldn't necessarily use their guidelines as if they were gospel. They may not all be suitable for our community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The relationship between character-abilities and plot-explanation isn't the same between JavaScript and jQuery. JQuery is a library of JavaScript, it belongs to JavaScript. This tag is most similar to the arrays tag on Stack Overflow.

This question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2033/does-zetsu-have-a-word-soul/2224Does Zetsu have a word soul? received some good answers a few days back. However, with the Naruto chapter 618, these answers became obsolete or even incorrect. Nothing personal against the people who answered them, but how do we deal with such cases?

Clearly, we cannot restrict questions to completed series only, because that would be the end of this site. In the beginning, as there is a relatively small number of regular users, we may be able to have all the obsolete answers edited, but this is clearly not going to work as the number of users grows. 

I have been thinking of what is a good way to handle it, but could not decide on anything.

Edit On second thoughts, I am undecided if the example given above really makes the old answers obsolete. However, regardless of the example being accurate or not, the question is still valid.

In the http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/6697/anime-and-manga?tab=conversationsfirst brainstorming session, we've discussed the status of "list" questions on Anime and Manga.

What are list questions?

Any question which asks for a list of items as the answer. Some examples:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2213/is-there-a-definitive-list-of-zombie-anime-out-there-or-in-the-makinghttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2213/is-there-a-definitive-list-of-zombie-anime-out-there-or-in-the-making
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/820/what-bankais-exist-within-soul-societyWhat Bankais exist within Soul Society?


The status of such questions was controversial, we aimed to officially define the position of such questions.

We've come to the following conclusions:

http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/conversation/list-questions-brainstorming-2013-01-30The status of "list" questions

A list question will generally be allowed, if it qualifies all 4 criteria below:


It is specific and to the point. Don't ask about list of abstract concepts or anime series featuring some theme.
The list items can be determined objectively. Don't ask about a list of our favorite things, or things we think are "good".
The list is reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire wiki-page listing your answer, the question is not reasonably scoped.
The list isn't prone to rapid change. If the list is hard to maintain, it won't be, thus losing its usefulness.


The fourth is a bit tricky. If the list proves to be useful enough to be maintained, a list changing rapidly can be fine. It's tricky and will be defined better once we have more users.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the status of list questions on this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure "experts" is the right word for it. Type B anime fans is probably a better term.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM You're gonna have to explain what Type B fans are. Since only Type B fans know what it means. :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial I guess technically we're not even that worried about Type A vs Type B at the moment. We're more worried about the very high portion of main-site questions which are about shounen shows. Of course, having questions on Naruto, Bleach, etc. is fine, but we're underrepresented in a lot of other genres.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who does the "we" refer to?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara The community. You really should try and make an effort to come to our sessions in chat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for clarifying that. Don't you think asking me to "make an effort" to join the chat at 2:30 am local time is a bit unreasonable? In any case, the posts here, especially the ones related to site usage should be written such that people who do not participate in chat should not miss the details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai Originally this question had the information from both here and http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/355/how-do-we-get-more-people-to-our-site. It was split because we discussed two mostly independent things, but the comments got left here instead of on the other post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai: That's why we have a log of those conversations. You can easily look at it [here](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/6697/anime-and-manga?tab=conversations)


















For questions that don't satisfy the 4 criteria, here is how we have decided they will be dealt with:


If it fails #1, close as "unclear what you're asking" because it's hard to tell what is being asked.
If it fails #2, close as "primarily opinion-based" because it's subjective.
If it fails #3, close as "too broad" because it isn't reasonably scoped.
If it fails #4, this will be handled on a case-by-case basis.


On #4, the important part is whether the list can be sufficiently be maintained and kept up to date so that it is still useful.

If it cannot be maintained, then we may lean towards closing the question. If it can be maintained, then it will be kept.



This may seem very strict, but it is necessary to filter out list questions that have the potential to degrade into an unconstructive mess.

Examples of lists question that passes all 4 criteria are:


"What are all the level 5's in the Index/Railgun universe?"
"What are all the shows that X director has produced?"


Note that this is not to say that these are good questions. They are just examples of questions that would be considered appropriate for the site.

The only difference is that the Type A vs. Type B question has a more clear-cut answer with much less room for debate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial: Not exactly.

The differences are clear and explicit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hence the "much less room for debate". Since it's generally agreed upon what a Type A vs. Type B is.


















In the http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/6697/anime-and-manga?tab=conversationsfirst brainstorming session, we've discussed http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/conversation/member-recruitment-brainstorming-session-2013-01-30the site's member recruitment model

We have decided to take the following steps:


Make a list of 5-10 series which would interest an audience of experts in anime/manga. https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/24/logan-mLogan M and https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/17/mysticialMystical are on it.
Seed the sites with good, high quality questions on those shows. Leave some of them unanswered to attract experts with an answer.
Post links to most voted and strongest questions on Reddit, IRC and possibly on 4chan/a/.


We will continue to track the progress of the recruitment state, and will present it in later sessions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we get more people to our site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that we currently haven't started anything yet. We're still solidifying a few of the rules and seeding questions before we proceed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that *actively* leaving questions unanaswered is not going to influence or help the cause. As long as you ask good questions, people will answer anyway (besides the fact that encouraging not to answer is not really what you want to do).


















I've been looking at the tags and I was looking at some of the chat from yesterday and saw that we have a really skewed number of questions. Are there some shows/manga that we want to attract/generate more questions for? And is there a good way to do that?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are there animes/mangas we want more questions for?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We aren't necessarily looking for a specific series, just a more diverse range of series.


















Mystical's answer is good. Some of those now have one or more questions from the past 24 hours. However, it is ultimately missing some things as well.

I don't think it's an issue of particular shows. We want more questions for all shows. But we also have an interest in keeping genres balanced so that all users can freely ask and answer questions about the shows that interest them. Right now that is the case for Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, and a handfull of other action/shounen shows. But there aren't many questions from other genres. That makes it hard for new users to contribute, and it's a bit off-putting if you only see one genre on the main page unless you are a fan of that genre. If we went viral right now, we'd be a hit in the Naruto community, but we'd have trouble bringing anyone else in, which would only make the problem worse. What we want is balance, so that we can attract a wide range of users whose interests span all of anime and manga.

The solution is definitely not to lower the number of shounen questions. That would require us to stop people from using the site the way they are supposed to be. We should strive to be a good resource for all genres, and we're already doing that for shounen. Now we need to expand to other genres. The list we put together is a good place to start, but if we stop there we will have just become a reference for those shows. It's got almost no shoujo or jousei works, which is a pretty big problem. It also has no sports shows, and we've had very few sports questions so far. Mecha is also underrepresented on the main site and on the list. And finally that list is tilted heavily towards newer anime. There may be more issues that I have not identified as well.

So what can you do?

First, if you're primarily interested in shounen, keep doing what you're doing. We need a continued supply of good questions and answers in order to keep people visiting the site. You might also consider checking out some other series from different genres if you see one that looks interesting on the main site, but you aren't obligated to do that.

If you're interested in other genres, you should ask questions about shows in those genres. It's fine to ask even if you know the answer. In fact, you can even http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/answer the question yourself if you know the answer. You might want to keep the question open for a little while before you do, because it could bring in answers from other interested people. The list on Mystical's answer is a good place to get started if you can't think of anything. Make sure they're good questions, though. You shouldn't ask a question just for the sake of putting it on the main page; it should be something that someone might want to know in the future. This is called seeding, and it's encouraged on beta sites.

Also, don't spam new questions just for this purpose. This may seem contradictory to the above, but it really isn't. We want to maintain balance, and if one user asks a lot of questions in a short period of time, that isn't maintaining balance. Instead of that, save that third or fourth question for another day. Right now the main page is actually very diverse, so there isn't too much need for new questions unless it fills some hole. If, in 48 hours, the main page has a lot of shounen questions, that's the right time to post some more.

If you see a question that seems like low-hanging fruit that was posted for the purpose of seeding, you should ask yourself if you really need the reputation for answering it. Sure, you can provide a good answer, but so can a new user who is looking to get started on the site. Part of the purpose of asking these questions is to increase the accessibility of the site to those who aren't knowledgeable about shounen specifically, and giving them some easier questions doesn't hurt that. If you're having trouble building up rep because the shows on the main site aren't diverse enough, then you should definitely answer, because you're the people who are supposed to benefit from it the most. If the question goes for a while with no answers, then anyone should feel free to answer it, but as long as it's on the main page, people are still looking at it. For this reason, I don't intend to answer any of these questions unless they clearly aren't going to be answered any time soon, and I'd recommend that other high rep users do the same.

Finally, don't forget to upvote questions you find interesting. This is especially important for the seeding questions, because it's just not as fun asking and answering questions when you only get +5 or +10 per question. These questions won't survive if we don't keep upvoting the interesting ones.

For now, Mystical and I are mostly dedicated to this, and a few other users like Krazer are helping. Anyone else is welcome to help. I don't think there's an immediate need for more questions from anime like the ones Mystical listed right now; instead, we should let the first wave gradually be answered and keep adding a few more whenever the balance gets worse. However, we're still lacking in other genres, particularly shoujo and jousei, so those should be a high priority. Right now, we've actually had the opposite effect: Naruto is pushed all the way to the 28th question. So we should hold off from the list shows for a little while and let the site reach a more stable balance before we add more. I have no doubt that in a day or two we'll need some more to rebalance the site.

I believe the problem right now is that we don't actually have anybody active here who watches those genres. So that might be tricky to get the ball rolling.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial The OP seems to have some knowledge of at least a couple of shoujo shows. Krazer has some answers about shoujo. I can wing a few questions from Kimi ni Todoke, Shugo Chara, Maid-sama, Honey and Clover, Kuragehime, Usagi Drop, etc. So while I agree that it will be harder, it's worth doing. Of course, the problem might work itself out on its own once we bring in more people interested in e.g. romance shows, but it also could keep getting worse if we do nothing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've only seen Skip Beat and Kare Kano - ages ago. I can try to squeeze a question out of them. We'll see.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it'd help to put "shoujo" in the name of the question and/or in the body so shoujo fans can find it by searching. I've searched for "shoujo" to try to answer more questions but I don't have time to type in every shoujo series title just to check if there happens to be a question for it. I've just done a search of the titles you mentioned here in these comments and it looks like nobody did end up squeezing out a question about any of them, so they're not searchable for a shoujo fan to find and want to become active in the site in order to answer them.


















Currently we have the tags:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/a-certain-magical-indexa-certain-magical-index
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/railgunrailgun


Which refer to:


"A Certain Magical Index" or "Toaru Majutsu no Index"
"A Certain Scientific Railgun" or "Toaru Kagaku no Railgun"


which are sister series in the same universe.

However, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/a-certain-scientific-railguna-certain-scientific-railgun is too long to be a tag. So we currently use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/railgunrailgun instead.

But given that these two series go together, there will likely be many questions with both tags.
An example of which is: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/how-is-misakas-railgun-so-destructiveHow is Misaka's railgun so destructive?

But it seems inconsistent to use the full name for one, and the shortened name for the other.



So what should we do?

Option 1: Shorten them to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/indexindex and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/railgunrailgun. And synonymize https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/a-certain-magical-indexa-certain-magical-index -> https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/indexindex

Option 2: Switch them both to the Japanese names: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-majutsu-no-indextoaru-majutsu-no-index and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-kagaku-no-railguntoaru-kagaku-no-railgun. (Both of which fit.) And then synonymize https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/a-certain-magical-indexa-certain-magical-index -> https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-majutsu-no-indextoaru-majutsu-no-index.

Option 3: Leave them inconsistent as is with: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/a-certain-magical-indexa-certain-magical-index and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/railgunrailgun



If you have other ideas, please post them.

Vote this up for Option 2.

Switch them both to the Japanese names: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-majutsu-no-indextoaru-majutsu-no-index and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-kagaku-no-railguntoaru-kagaku-no-railgun.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suggest also synonyms [index] -> [toaru-majitsu-no-index] and [railgun] -> [toaru-kagaku-no-railgun] so that they are easier to type.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wouldn't the suggestion for "toaru-majitsu-no-index]" come up if you type "index" anyways? I think the tag [tag:index] is too vague.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JonLin Yes it will popup. Since it matches any word in the tag. Searching for `toaru` will give both if we went with this option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One opposition I have to this is that not everyone knows the Japanese name. Like, do many people know what *Hagane no Renkinjutsushi* is? Not likely. Additionally, what would we do if the Japanese name was too long? How can this apply to future issues of the same type?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric Well, this is a special case since the keywords are "index" and "railgun" which are common in both the English and Japanese names. Furthermore we have not been consistent with choosing English vs. Japanese names. Pretty much whoever is creating the tag is picking whichever version they are most familiar with or whatever they believe is the most commonly recognized one. I'm actually against taking a hard-line approach with "English only" names since there are a lot of shows that are better known by their Japanese names - especially among those who watch primarily new shows.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You do have a point, though I still think sticking with the *best known* name is the better approach. If this does get passed, though, I would suggest that all Japanese tags have in their description the English name as well, so that someone typing "railgun" will see "toaru-kagaku-no-railgun: A Certain Scientific Railgun" (or similar).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric My vision for this is that all shows have the best known name (English or Japanese Romanji). The other one is synonymized with it. The tag descriptions will have both (and the Japanese name in Japanese). For this particular case, I actually consider the Japanese romanji names to be better recognized than the English ones. But I'd expect that to change if and when the shows get dubbed in English.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That actually sounds about right. It will be a problem, though, for any series which has the "best known name" with a length longer than allowed. (Which I'm sure has already happened, even if we have no questions on it yet.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric We'll handle those on a case-by-case basis like this one. Most of the time, there will be a suitable abbreviation that fits. But in this case, that abbreviation is "index" which sounds a bit too general despite it immediately clicking to anyone who is familiar with the series.


















I am not sure that is such a bad thing. As a whole, this site's population represents the demographics of the real world anime/manga fans. That means, there are more https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto questions here because more people follow it. In other words, if you randomly pick an anime/manga fan, he/she is more likely to be following Naruto. That's not easy to change.

Any artificial means to "correct" the demographics would be futile for now. Let's say, I feel like I should correct it, and start watching some relatively rare anime. Then I ask questions, but what's this? No one answers, because no one else watches them! The other alternative is answer my own question, but what purpose does it serve, if no one else finds it useful?

However, I am not entirely pessimistic on this. As more people join, we would hopefully have more "non-Naruto" fans (here, I use Naruto to represent the other popular series as well), and then we would hopefully get more questions on other anime too. However, the distribution will always be skewed in favour of Naruto and other popular anime. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not so much the fact that Naruto is the most popular that's the problem; it's that it is dominating to the point that it's turning away fans of other types of shows who don't watch Naruto. If I go to http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?type=bypopularity, Naruto is indeed quite popular, but only #4 on that site (which may not be entirely representative, but it's a good guess). Bakemonogatari has 60% as many viewers, but 0 questions vs 67. AniDB has very similar statistics. Even if these are skewed and it only has 10% the viewership of Naruto we're still overdue for some questions about it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, if by "obscure anime", you mean the sorts of things Mystical listed, then I don't think they're that obscure. We have quite a few users interested in these shows. If you mean [tag:parappa-the-rapper], then I'll admit that it's pretty obscure and unlikely to help anyone in the near future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I get it now. Let me think about it.


















Throughout the SE Network, there are meta posts for Community Promotion Ads. Their objective, among other things related to the context of each site, is to promote "anything else your community would genuinely be interested in".

There's nothing wrong with posting questions you know the answers to, and answer them yourself. 

As a matter of fact, we already have a recruitment model (it's found here on meta), we agreed that we should seed the site with questions from various series, in order to attract users. 

However, note that we aim for the so-called experts. We want folks who've seen a lot, read a lot and know a lot. These folks will ask good questions and give great answers. 

If we fill out site with (no offense) kids who only ever watched Naruto up to episode 50, the site will look and operate accordingly. 

There's nothing wrong with asking and answering your own question, it's even encouraged! But please try to adhere to the recruitment model for now, we haven't even begun phase 2 of it. 

Long story short: do it to share your knowledge, not to attract users.

The second problem is that popularity can change. Thus rendering the answers obsolete. A show can come out in Japan first. And is popular only in Japan and fansub watchers. Then later when it gets dubbed in English, it becomes in popular in North America and Europe.


In other words, I see a high potential for such questions to degrade.

That said, I'm not strongly against this type of question. I'm willing to be swayed in favor of allowing them if anyone provides some good counter-arguments.

Which, if the list isn't too long or too often updated, would most likely be fine. The key difference here is that a list of awards is *objective* - at least more so than how "popular" a show is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll note that there might be an issue with finding the suitable sources that show what awards X anime received. But that's a different issue.


















I added the description to include manga simply because there wasn't a manga related tag, but in retrospect, I think the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/currently-airingcurrently-airing tag should only apply to anime mainly because of how the two are produced. There's a lot of manga series, which doesn't necessarily have to follow a regular release schedule like an anime TV series does, which are ongoing. The manga medium allows the writers and publishers to produce chapters almost indefinitely, whereas a slotted TV series really doesn't have that option.

It seems that a lot of the manga related questions right now are all of series that are ongoing. However, a majority of the anime series that have questions are shows that have ended, or at the very least, has a foreseeable end to the show. Thus having the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/currently-airingcurrently-airing tag would be more meaningful.

This does raise the question of how to deal with the tag on anime questions where the anime has ended, yet the question was asked when it was still airing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see, this makes sense. Thanks for clarifying. Didn't mean to pick on your description. :)


















There's another criterion, there has to be at least 100 overall questions in the tag in question. There're currently only 75.

Once we have 100 https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto questions, all badges should be awarded.

For more information, visit the https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/63835/166899official FAQ page on tag badges.

I'd say it is a practical thing, since it appears only 3 digits are represented there. So that is why it is not represented with the whole number, and not with 1.5k (since this one has 4 digits, including the 'k').
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yup, it's just rounding as far as I can tell. That's why Madara, Krazer, and SingerOfTheFall all have 3k. But it doesn't apply any sort of rounding for <1k rep.


















I've noticed that when editing list items, the Markdown preview area will display them spaced out:



Whereas the actual output displays it fine:


List item
List item
List item


There seems to be a margin-bottom: 1em set on .wmd-preview ul li, .wmd-preview ol li, that isn't there in the actual output.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Inconsistency between the Markdown preview area and actual outputb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's on ".post-text ul li, .post-text ol li" but only for half the value "margin-bottom: 0.5em;"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or so it seems.


















Good catch. I have pushed a fix to our dev server so the preview and final render are consistent(0.5em for bottom margin). The change will be live after our next production build.

I would like to bring on a question about the quality of tag wikis. What is a tag wiki? A tag wiki should briefly tell us some basic information about the subject of the tag. First of all, just an example to consider:

Look at https://stackoverflow.com/tags/c++/infothe C++ tag on SO. It tells us about what C++ is, links to the FAQs, about some things to remember when asking the question, etc. If I want to check if the C++ tag is good for my question, I can immediately know it by reading the tag info.

Below I will try to give some advice about how to make a tag wiki look good, informative and concise in the same time. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I write a good tag wiki?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See this blog post — **[Advice on writing good Tag Wikis](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/)**


















Can I just copy-past the text from < somewhere >?

No, you can't. While there can be some useful info in the begining of wikipedia articles, or articles on other websites, you should not just copy-paste it. It is always much better to rewrite that information with your own words. Take a look at https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/372/copy-paste-for-tag-excerpts-allowedthis question for additional info.

Well in that case, what should I include into the tag wiki?

Everything which will be useful for someone who will open the wiki to learn what is the tag about. I would suggest the following:


The excerpt should contain a very brief description of the tag's subject. If the tag is about an anime/manga series, a good idea is to tell what is the series, and what is it about. Here is a decent example:


  Cowboy Bebop is a 1998 Japanese anime series directed by Shinichirō
  Watanabe. It follows the adventures, misadventures and tragedies of a
  bounty hunter ("cowboy") crew traveling on the Bebop, their starship.


If the tag is about some general stuff, the excerpt should tell people exactly what is the tag about. Here is a decent example (from https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cultureculture):



  Questions about anime and manga in the broader context of Japanese culture. Includes both questions about cultural origins for anime/manga references and questions about the cultural impact of a particular series.


However, don't make the excerpts too vague. After reading the excerpt, one should be able to understand if the tag suits well for his/her question.


The info should contain more detailed information about the tags. This may include a slightly more detailed plot explanation, related media (anime/manga/games/etc), links to official and fan-made resources, etc. Basically, the tag info should provide enough information to briefly get acquainted with the subject. Don't make it too long, though, we are not going to re-write wikipedia articles.


How about links? Should I include links?

Yes, however:


you shouldn't leave the links without explanation. A short (1-2 sentences) explanation of where the link leads to is more than welcomed.
obviously, don't leave links to anything illegal :P
try to always add a link to the source if you are quoting any material. 
don't leave too many links. Usually links to 2-3 extensive sources about the subject are enough.


Anything else I should know?

Well, just a couple more things that may seem obvious at the first glance, but are important:


Don't add useless text. "Use tag XXX for questions about anime and manga XXX" is probably not a good tag wiki text. 
No spoilers. Try to avoid being too concrete while describing the plot. Remember that people that will open the wiki may just be starting to watch/read manga/anime, so don't even spoil anything that happens in the 2nd chapter of a 500-chapter manga.
Add any info about the tag usage that you think is necessary. For example, if there are two tags, say, tag XXX and tag YYY, which are similar to each other, it is a good idea to explain where to use XXX, and where to use YYY in their tag wikis. 


What do I do with existing tag wikis that I believe are low-quality?

Obviously, edit them to make them better. 

Most SE users have faced a situation in which they were not sure how to tag a question properly, or whether a specific tag is suitable to their question. Well-written tag wikis help to deal with this problem, and reduce the amount of incorrectly-tagged questions on the site. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the near future, it may be worthwhile to standardize tag wiki formatting and what information/links are contained within them. For now I think following these guidelines is sufficient, but as we grow we'll need to be stricter about what does and doesn't belong.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM, true, but that's why I made it a community wiki ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are we allowing links to legally licensed distributions of the anime?


















Such questions should be closed. Answers should be downvoted, and maybe deleted. 

If you can edit the post to improve it, do so. If you cannot , leave a comment for the author to do it, and if he fails to do so, flag or vote to delete it. 

Posts like those aren't useful, there's a huge difference between "it's a plot hole" and "the author sucks". 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...and if it's just a snarky answer to a *legitimate* question, you should flag for moderator attention.


















Very few of such sites (Online sites for watching anime/reading manga) are legal. There's a giant legal blur over these sites because the law changes from country to country and from site to site based on usage. 

For that reason we decided to avoid the trap hole and disallow these questions completely. 

Unless the site in question is official, and the question is constructive (i.e.not "Should I use this site?"), it's probably not welcome here. If your question answers the above criteria, go ahead and ask it! We'll be happy to answer it. 

As for My Anime List specifically, it's very likely that any question you may ask here is either off-topic (as it should be directed to their support), or not constructive (as it would be a recommendation question).

So here's what you do, ask it anyway. At the worst case, it would be closed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5that pretty much answers it  unless it is constructive towards the answer/question do not use practicaly :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Huh? How is MAL illegal? Just because a lot of its users illegally acquire their anime does not make the site itself illegal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure that it's true that sites like MAL are illegal, at least in the US (where Stack Exchange is based). It hosts a few images per series, but that could potentially be fair use, and there aren't any downloads available, though they do link to fansub groups (which is questionable, but 2nd order links are probably fine).  However, streaming sites and manga databases are very clearly illegal in most cases (excluding Crunchyroll and a few other simulcast sites). In any case I agree that these discussions are still not constructive whether or not they are legal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not MAL specifically, I was referring more to sites for watching anime and manga. I'm sorry if that was unclear. About MAL, it's very likely that any question you may ask here is either off-topic (as it should be directed to their support), or not constructive (as it would be a recommendation question). Here's what you do @Dimitrimx, ask it anyway. At the worst case, it would be closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay i do understand it now then ^^b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also @all, note that my opinion isn't necesarily the community's opinion. If anyone has a different opinion than mine, don't hesitate to downvote, comment, and give your own answer. The community's collective opinion matters much more than one of a single moderator.


















As a general rule of thumb, ask yourself "Could there be an expert on this subject?"

There can be an expert on the following subjects (for example, not limited to):


Naruto (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/series-name-hereseries-name-here)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production or [manga-production]
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history


There probably cannot be an expert on the following:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/characterscharacters and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-abilitiescharacter-abilities
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variationsvariations
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/opening-songsopening-songs


These tags are under discussion right now, we aren't sure about whether to keep them or not.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd put [tag:plot-explanation] in the second category as well.


















In terms of quality, I personally find Naruto, Bleach, DBZ, and even One Piece questions rather trying. There are about 3 million sites out there which cater to these anime. While it's impossible to clamp down on questions from these titles, what can be improved is the signal-to-noise ratio: ask more questions on other titles and ensure that they get comprehensive answers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't agree with Naruto, Bleach, DBZ, OP = noise and other titles = signal. We want people to come to *our* site. They are free to visit the 3 million other sites but we are not concerned with that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai Why would they come here when a host of dedicated sites exist elsewhere? Sites which cater to titles like, say, GITS, Baccano, Nodame Cantabile, etc., are rarer and consequently, posing and answering questions on them will draw their traffic. This question is about drawing more traffic, and traffic that will stick around.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am not opposed to posting questions on other titles. However, there is no reason to *assume* that people searching for popular titles would not come here. If the content here makes to the first page of search engines, people would definitely come here even searching for the popular titles. Most of the top "other" sites are forums, which caters to a specific demographic. People looking for reliable content would prefer coming here than going through fan theory sites, provided we maintain this place properly, through voting the good content up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai Er, and that's what I'm saying: there is no content here to do so. It's mainly sharingan after bankai after sharingan, ad nauseum. I don't share your confidence on the quality or reliability of most of the answers either.


















The idea behind it was that a new user would try to tag their question with the series (which doesn't exist), then their next try would be either https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga, since they're blacklisted, we have both these tags so that when the user types either "anime" and "manga", they'll find it.



https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag was created, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-retaganime-retag and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-retagmanga-retag were synonymed to it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see, that makes sense. Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Couldn't you just make 1 tag of it then ?  anime-manga-retag ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx: I think a better course of action is to create a [tag:retag] tag, and synonym both to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha Sounds like a even beter plan


















We have decided to eliminate the bigger meta tags for the following reasons:


Meta tags don't add much to the question. It's usually obvious what the question is about.
They are inconsistently being used. Most users don't know they exist so they don't add the tag(s).
They hurt search engine visibility.*


*This last point is important. The final goal for any StackExchange site is to get most of the traffic from search engines. However, in order to do this, the questions need to be searchable.

The searchability of questions is heaviliy influenced by the title that is used.As a result, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19190/should-questions-include-tags-in-their-titlesSE appends the most popular tag to the question title.

So for example:


Title: "Why aren't mages trusted to remove their own limiters?"
Tags: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nanohananoha


will have a title of: "nanoha - Why aren't mages trusted to remove their own limiters?"

The keyword "nanoha" (the name of the show) is appended to the title to enhance SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

The problem is that meta tags are almost always the "most popular" tags. So we have this situation:


Title: "Why aren't mages trusted to remove their own limiters?"
Tags: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-abilitiescharacter-abilitieshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nanohananoha


Where the title becomes: "Character Abilities - Why aren't mages trusted to remove their own limiters?"
Which has no indication to the name of the show. People google for "Nanoha" are unlikely to find this question even though it may be relevant.



So we made the decision to nuke the worst of the meta tags. For everything else, we will be manually fixing up the question (either by editing the title, or deleting unnecessary tags) to maximize search engine visibility.



So far we have (or currently are) eliminating the following tags:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/characterscharacters - burninated
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-abilitiescharacter-abilities - burninated
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/variationsvariations - burninated
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/plot-explanationplot-explanation - burninated


More may be added in the future.

[tag:analysis] should probably be killed outright. The others need to be looked at individually, but most of them should probably be merged with existing tags.

I will write a proper answer later.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai: From my point of view, it is enough, as long as you post content of more genres. You may be elected, but still ask other people's opinions/expertise on genres you're not comfortable with (in chat). Consider that other may have seen a ton of anime, but not Naruto (for example), but every once in a while a Naruto question will most likely pop-up, so they'll ask the opinion of people who've seen Naruto on whether or not it is interesting posting material.

We all love http://anime.stackexchange.comAnime and Manga - Stack Exchange, but there is a whole world of people out there who need answers to their questions and don't even know that this site exists. When they arrive from Google, what will their first impression be? Let's try to look at this site through the eyes of someone who's never seen it before, and see how we stack up against the rest of the 'Net.

The https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/site-evalSite Evaluation review queue is open and populated with 10 questions that were asked and answered in the last quarter. Run a few Google searches to see how easy they are to find and compare the answers we have with the information available on other sites.

Rating the questions is only a part of the puzzle, though. Do you see a pattern of questions that should have been closed but are not? Questions or answers that could use an edit? Anything that's going really well? Post an answer below to share your thoughts and discuss these questions and the site's health with your fellow users!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's get critical: Feb 2013 Site Evaluationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From the discussion below my answer, I would request that we get more clarity from SE on whether the Site Evaluation looks for searchability or quality (or both?). I *think* it should be both, but the instructions during the review are confusing. Perhaps a topic for our next chat cast.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai I think it wants both, but I think it's difficult to rate both at once sometimes. Yes, the perfect question would be excellent in both quality and searchability, and the worst question would be terrible in both quality and searchability, but as seen below, sometimes a great question is hard to search for. I'm sure the opposite can happen as well.


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/864/is-the-hyga-main-familys-juinjutsu-a-swastikaIs the Hyuuga main family's juinjutsu a Swastika?

It is difficult to Google this question, and I suspect that it is because of the "ū" symbol in the title.

When I searched for hyuga juinjutsu swastika, there was an anime SE result on the second page, but it was actually for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions?page=4&sort=newesta list of new questions instead of the question itself. When I searched for hyuuga juinjutsu swastika, I found many other sites' explanations, but anime SE was nowhere to be found until page four where it linked to the same list of new questions again.

Yes, if I search hyūga juinjutsu swastika, the actual question is the very first result. But how many people are going to go to the effort of finding this special symbol just to Google a quick question about an anime series?

I suggest that we try to avoid using "special symbols" in romanization in order to increase search hits.

Anyone doing the site evaluation should be willing to put in some effort and time. Copy pasting the question title as is into Google search box doesn't help much. It rarely happens that people post the same question using the exact same phrase on other sites, so that way our question will always end up on the front page, if not at the top of the list. 

Taking the example given in another answer "Is the Hyūga main family's juinjutsu a Swastika?", the words Hyūga and juinjutsu are not used as often, so naturally our question takes the top spot. When I instead searched for "Is the Hyuuga clan's symbol a swastika?", I did not find our question on the first 20 pages. Moreover, although the answer written here is great, I found better answers on other sites listed on page 1 (Better is subjective and no offense meant to the person who posted that answer here). Hence, my rating for this question was "Needs Improvement".

Remember that the purpose of site evaluation is to measure how likely people are to come to our site through search engines. We should therefore search the phrase that an average person would enter into the search engine. Simply asking our question to the search engine, and then throwing a party when it comes up on top (that is, rating as "Excellent") doesn't really serve any purpose. 

Edit Note that a "Needs Improvement" rating does not necessarily mean that the question or answer is bad. The way the Site Evaluation criteria is currently implemented, it seems the rating includes both quality and searchability. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with what you say but at the same time, I think the descriptions provided by SE as a whole are somewhat confusing. Are we rating the quality of the questions/answers or how easy they are to Google? It is hard to Google that Hyuuga question, but the question and answer are both great. I feel like it would be easier if SE had two separate ratings: one for quality, and one for searchability.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I totally agree. I too found it a bit odd that quality and searchability are bundled into one, so it looks like we need to rate it for both together.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you google for "Naruto Swastika" then we're pretty high on the front page, though admittedly not high enough that we'd beat out the other links. But since the question title doesn't have "Hyuuga" we don't make it on to google at all there. Similarly if you google for "Fairy Law vs Fairy Glitter" or "One Piece Currency" we're on the first page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also feel free to link me to which sites you think had better answers. My answer had everything that I knew off the top of my head, but if there are other places with more information I can include that as well.


















I was wondering if we should be doing edits such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/2549/revisionshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/2549/revisions. It only changes 'chakara' to 'chakra' and 'Jiraya' to 'Jiraiya'. I think that we should avoid making edits which only changes romanization, because it can lead to unnecessary ill-feeling, and potentially drive users away if it is done too often. I suggest that when there is no one correct known romanization, let the OP keep what they used. 

Thus, for example, in Naruto, don't change Hyuuga to Hyuga (or vice versa), but changing Peine to Pain is okay, because that name intentionally uses the English word Pain. In your own answer though, use whatever you prefer (or even switch to OP's preference, if you wish). 

No offence meant to Chetter Hummin, who is obviously trying to help. 

EDIT Based on Logan M's answer, I think the example chosen is not a good one, so let me try with something else. Fairy Tail will offer plenty. 


Jellal or Gerard?
Juvia Lockser or Loxar?
Gray or Grey?
Carla or Charle or Sharuru?
Wendy Marvel or Marble?
Ur or Ul?


I respectfully disagree that we should prefer whatever Google search prefers (I know Logan M didn't imply this). Users who read scanlations or watch fansubs are likely to be familiar with one or the other, and I think we should we should be open to everyone. Of course, as mentioned above, if one correct agreed romanization is available, we should use that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we make edits which only alter the romanization?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't comment on the Fairy Tail examples specifically. If they really are both acceptable then I agree that they should not be changed, even if one of them is more common.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am usually quite liberal with most rules (and whether rules themselves are liberal or strict), so either decision is fine with *me*. When the community is small with the same bunch of people posting, it won't be a big problem. However, as more people join who were not part of the core group in the early days, I am worried we would have quite a few revert wars, which would cause a headache to moderators and high rep users, so I tend to lean towards letting people choose what they are familiar with, unless it is way over the top.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't post an edit if you think it is too minor. The point of delaying the edit privilege to higher reputation users is that they learn what's acceptable and what is not (via the suggested edits system). If both types are equivalent, even if one is more popular than the other, it's likely that the edit is too minor. However, fixing a type in a keyword that's likely to be searchable in Google, is not a minor edit. Your Fairy Tail's example is probably too minor. The Naruto one however, is not, and is valid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I want to compare to german.SE: Since one or two months (or maybe longer), they correct minor typos. That feels stupid, and as a reader, I hate that. It confuses.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@looper I undestand it can be frustrating, and I have seen people complain about it on the English SE site, but correcting typos may still be okay here (`Oen Picee` to `One Piece`, for example). However, changing `Ruffy` to `Luffy` (or vice-versa) is stupid and borderline rude, because to correct a typo, you need to know the "correct" spelling. By making such "typo correction", I am telling the other user that his choice is wrong and mine is correct, when in fact, neither is "correct" or "wrong".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Oen Picee` to `One Piece` is okay, but should mistakes like `a error` really be corrected? They don't add any value ...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@looper You actually bring up an interesting point. I think this would be very subjective. My take is that if the edit doesn't add any value to the post, then leave the post alone and don't do the edit. However, if you are making *other* "good" edits, you may also change these minor things as a "add on", then that should be okay. But in either case, we should not allow `Ruffy`  `Luffy` type of edits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai Absolutely agreed :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A error vs an error should be corrected only as part of a larger cleanup correcting larger or multiple issues. By itself it's probably too minor.


















I voted to approve this edit because I saw it as correcting an error, not changing romanization style. If I do a google search for "Chakara" as the OP had written, Google gives me a "Did you mean chakra?" message. I was able to find some locations that spelled it "Chakara" in a Naruto context, but all of them are on forums and every semi-official source spells it "Chakra". I also noted that Chakra is originally written チャクラ in Japanese, which could be romanized as "Chakura" but not "Chakara" in any standard romanization scheme. Assuming Naruto is actually referencing the Hindu concept of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChakraChakra, that also is almost universally spelled Chakra in English, not Chakara. The two would be pronounced fairly differently in Hindi.

I did not pay much attention to "Jiraya" vs "Jiraiya" because I don't know Naruto that well, but a quick Google search again demonstrates that the latter is preferred. Given that his name is written 自来也, it would not be romanized as Jiraya in any standard English romanization scheme (though it could be in some in French and Spanish if I understand correctly).

I agree that we should not be challenging the OP's choice of romanization style without good reason, but I think the case you've pointed to is a case of misspelling, not of differing romanization styles. Correcting spelling is a perfectly valid reason to edit a post, and the editor's explanation for the edit was "corrected spelling".

If the OP wants to switch to a different romanization style for the edited post, I don't think anyone will complain, but it should be spelled properly or else people are perfectly within their rights to edit it. Having lots of posts with poor spelling and grammar reflects poorly on our site. If anyone can provide any source which claims that "Chakara" and "Jiraya" are acceptable styles then I think it's fine to use them, but as far as I can tell "Chakara" is most commonly used to describe a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakararare marine phenomenon.

I will post some more examples to illustrate the problem better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the answer. I think this is a resonably good approach to handle the situation.


















My proposal is as follows:


Allow question on anime-like and heavily-anime-inspired series (The prominent example is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avatar-the-last-airbenderavatar-the-last-airbender).
Allow question on anime-style and anime-based games. For now, only story related questions should be allowed. Leave game mechanics and gameplay to Arqade.


That's it in my opinion, we shouldn't expand the scope too much too quickly now.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This sounds good to me. One question though: how do we define anime-style and anime-inspired? Using an extreme counter-example: does Tom and Jerry qualify?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have a look at Logan's answer. He gives a good suggestion.


















For those who have not been flowing along, we have been having weekly chat discussions about about site policy and content.

Note: My viewpoint is roughly the same as Madara's, so if you want the tl;dr read his post. I've tried to expand on where exactly the boundaries should be in my view.

I think this is a matter of two different viewpoints. If you think this site should focus on anime and manga as artistic media, then you probably don't think we should expand.

I tend to see anime and manga more as a culture, at least in the West. There are lots of games, manga-style comics (including manhwa and manhua), and anime-style cartoons which are targeted at, and are just as popular as, the average anime/manga series, and it's strange to not be able to discuss them here. That isn't to say that we're expanding our scope to include Star Trek, even though Star Trek probably is popular among manga fans. But we're including things that would be natural to discuss on an anime-themed site. What exactly those are is up for debate.

The following are my proposed expansions of the scope. I've tried to simultaneously be open about what sorts of topics we allow but set fairly strict boundaries.



Manhwa and Manhua, being commonly based off of Japanese Manga, are obvious choices. There really wasn't ever any reason to ban them except that it was convenient to define Manga by the origin. But that convenience for us isn't worth excluding a number of good questions about these series. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_English-language_mangaOEL manga is also in this category, but differentiating it from comic books/graphic novels can be difficult. I propose the following test: If a regular manga reader who is not familiar with the series can immediately tell that it is not manga from one or two pages (ignoring things like page orientation) then it should be allowed. This would include things like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegatokyoMegatokyo but not http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomestuckHomestuck. Most OEL manga identify themselves as such, and they tend to be published by only a few companies, so there are unlikely to be very many borderline cases. I also don't think we'll get a lot of questions on this topic, so putting too much thought into where the borders are seems like a waste of time at this point.

Some questions related to Manhwa and Manhua, whose statuses might be under consideration given this change:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/878/why-is-cassano-called-the-devil-of-the-right-arm/881#881Why is Cassano called the "Devil of the Right Arm"?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/749/how-are-manhwa-and-manhua-received-in-japanHow are manhwa and manhua received in Japan?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2561/how-long-was-shi-woon-trained-by-goomoonryongHow long was Shi-woon trained by Goomoonryong?




Likewise, including cartoons based on anime, where the primary fanbase is highly correlated with the anime fanbase, seems okay. That will have to be judged on a case-by-case basis. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avatar-the-last-airbenderavatar-the-last-airbender was deemed to be okay, but http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_JackSamurai Jack was not, even though both are anime-inspired. There probably aren't too many shows that are in the grey area between these two, so this hopefully won't be a recurring problem. 

I'd say that the test for borderline cases her is the following: if a relatively well-informed anime fan who has never seen or heard of this particular show could immediately discern that the show is probably not a Japanese anime, then it doesn't pass. If they can't tell just based off the artwork, it's probably anime-inspired enough that we can allow it. I think there aren't very many series that will pass that test (I could not think of any other than Avatar off the top of my head). 

The following questions are related to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avatar-the-last-airbenderavatar-the-last-airbender and are affected by this. As of now that is the only anime-style television show that is not anime but is being allowed.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2562/what-can-energybending-doWhat can energybending do?


It's worth noting that https://scifi.stackexchange.com/Scifi has a lot of Avatar-related questions (I count 53, which is more than all of their anime questions combined). It is one of the series that they are well-equipped to answer about. Whether or not we decide that can ask your Avatar question here, you can certainly do so there. This overlap is fine, as our communities have different cultures and interests, so you'll probably receive a different answer here or there. You should factor that in when you decide which site to ask on, and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-cross-posting-a-question-on-multiple-stack-exchange-sites-permitted-if-the-qu/64073#64073don't ask on both sites.



Live action adaptations of anime/manga, whether Japanese, Korean, Chinese, or from any other country, shouldn't be terribly controversial. At the moment, I do not believe we should expand beyond that to include all J-dramas, K-dramas, etc. While there are a lot of fans of these, the only cases where there's a large overlap between anime and drama fans are adaptations of anime/manga. I don't think this is really expanding our scope, but clarifying it.

At the moment I don't think we've had any questions about live-action versions specifically.



Games are a particularly tricky area. There are a lot of games which probably count as anime-style or anime-based. First, we definitely don't want to allow gameplay questions about these games. We aren't a gamer community, and we shouldn't strive to promote that content. If you want to ask gameplay questions, https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade is a great site for a large number of games.

So we're left with questions about the story, characters, lore, etc. That's essentially the same as what we allow questions about in terms of anime. We also need to know how to define what "anime-style" or "anime-based" means. However, it's typically pretty clear whether a game counts as anime-style or not. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouhouTouhou Project games obviously count, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_%28series%29Grand Theft Auto games obviously don't. But there are a lot of intermediate cases.

I propose the following, though I'll admit I'm not happy about it. If the art style of the game is similar enough to anime-style that a fairly standard-looking anime could be made from it without changing the style, then it should be allowed. This excludes games with realistic art styles like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_effectMass Effect, and also games with cartoon styles like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_RapperPaRappa the Rapper, even though both of them have related anime series which are on-topic here.

If that's confusing, it's easier to show examples of what would be allowed. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PokemonPokemon, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlazBlue_seriesBlazBlue, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_Of_SeriesThe Tales RPGs, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcana_HeartArcana Heart, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IdolmasterTHE iDOLM@STER, and any games directly based on an anime are allowed. For reference, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarioMario, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_%28series%29Halo, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinecraftMinecraft definitely don't fit the bill. I also suggest that we be fairly strict when it comes to new game series. If a series isn't obviously acceptable, then we shouldn't allow it without discussing it specifically on meta. This is mostly to prevent our site from getting flooded.

I view this policy as an extension of our policy allowing story questions about visual novels with some gameplay elements. We're now reducing the requirement from that the game is part-visual novel to that it's an anime-style game, which I think is fixing what was an inconsistency.

Some questions which are related and could potentially be affected by changes:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2555/is-ditto-a-failed-mew-cloneIs Ditto a Failed Mew Clone?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/507/which-melty-blood-games-are-relevant-plotwiseWhich Melty Blood games are relevant, plotwise?


It's worth noting that plot-related questions are allowed at https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade, though they are uncommon. As such this material would be on-topic on both sites. Our site has different culture and standards from Arqade, so the overlap isn't a problem, but you should consider which site to ask your question on and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/is-cross-posting-a-question-on-multiple-stack-exchange-sites-permitted-if-the-qu/64073#64073don't ask on both sites.



I'd also like to clarify that I do not think we should allow questions about the production of any of the above categories. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production is fine, because it's of direct interest to a sizable number of people in our community. However, asking about the production of a video game or a cartoon series really isn't on topic. https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/Game Development, https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/Graphic Design, and http://movies.stackexchange.comMovies & TV are all great sites in the SE network which will take some of those questions, but you should check their FAQs before asking.

This post is now essentially obsolete; all these statistics are easily accessible through http://codemanteau.com/stacker/?siteId=225this site, which is run by https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/274/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A2キルア. I am still collecting data, but there's little reason to continue updating this page.



Original post:

I've been collecting stats from our http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/31538/anime-mangaArea51 page on a daily basis. These statistics are publicly available, but they have to be saved and compiled by hand because they're updated regularly.

These statistics will be updated approximately once a week, probably on Monday mornings whenever someone bugs me enough to do so in chat. The statistics are taken at approximately 0:30 UTC, though I may be as much as a few hours late (this shouldn't affect things drastically). I've also been collecting network-wide statistics from the http://stackexchange.com/sites#trafficmain Stack Exchange page, but I don't intend to publish those here because that's around 700 numbers per day, of which only a very small amount is relevant to us. You can message me on chat if you need some of that data.

The daily statistics have a lot of noise, but there is an advantage over weekly ones. Since the traffic per day is the median over a 2-week period, it is possible with a pretty strong degree of certainty to conclude approximately what the traffic was on any given day. If the traffic drops, then the traffic on that day must be lower than what is reported, and if it increases it must be higher than what is reported. If it stays the same we can't conclude anything. However, if all you want is a broad overview, I've also included a summary first by taking only Monday statistics.

If there are other numbers you want to see which I'm not posting, feel free to request them.

Thanks to user https://academia.meta.stackexchange.com/users/2700/fxF'x on Academia for the table design, which was used in https://academia.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/283/keeping-track-of-our-statsthis post. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Keeping Track of our Site Statsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We *can* share those statistics if the numbers are public anyway. Ping any of us in chat. Only if it's public though!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha The difficulty is that historical stats are not public information anymore. By compiling this, I am essentially making it public. You might be able to share the stats anyway, but I wouldn't want you to have to update this post on a regular basis and it's worth having it available to everyone, so I'll keep doing this until it's not necessary anymore.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you were able to get to those stats as a normal users (even if you had to put up some work for it), I can share it as a moderator. You can post the useful stuff here though, nothing preventing you from doing that! You already have my +1.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM If the stats are gained from analyzing the stats on Area51, there's no problem but moderators cannot share data that is only available to them because they're moderators.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alenanno I don't know exactly what stats moderators can see that I can't (nor do I care to know—the above statistics are sufficient for everything I need). If there's an easy way to pull up Area51 stats from the past, that might actually be useful and allowed. If they don't have access to that, then it's no different if the mods gather and post the stats or I do. In any case I'm fine gathering the stats and updating this post occasionally.


















I would like to add something to Logan's answer, which I generally agree with.

If the name can be romanized in different ways, all of which are good, then it should be up to the OP to chose, especially if the ambiguity is about something like r-l sounds, neither of which is "right" or "wrong". So if the OP choses "Ul" over "Ur", it's his right, and suggested edits that try to change this should be rejected. Same goes for the answers. If the question has "Ul", and I prefer "Ur", I will just use it in my own answer, and there is absolutely no need to also try to edit the name in the quesiton itself or other answers.

If, however, one version is generally preferred over the other, or if there is a clear type/misspelling ("Narooto"? xD), then the suggested edits that attempt to fix this should be accepted.

In https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2562/what-can-energybending-do/this question, I mentioned that the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avatar-the-last-airbenderavatar-the-last-airbender may not the best choice for the question, as the tag only covers the first series, Avatar: The last Airbender. The question, however covers both, Avatar: The last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. Should there be a second tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-legend-of-korrathe-legend-of-korra, or should the Avatar-Tag be generalized? A new tag can make searches more specific, however both series are simply referred to as Avatar, most times.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag: Avatar: The last Airbenderb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seeing as how it's not even anime, it should, IMO, not even be allowed on this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@coleopterist: That was already [discussed](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/conversation/third-chat-cast-expanding-our-scope-2013-02-09) and it was decided to allow it as a pilot.


















I think a second tag is in order. If we have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naruto-shippuudennaruto-shippuuden, we should have both tags. 

Questions from both tags can be searched for by searching for [avatar*]. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I should learn how to use the search ...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not entirely certain your example was a very good one considering nobody uses the shippuuden tag.  All Naruto questions have been asked under the generalized Naruto tag whether they're from the original series or shippuuden.  In fact, looking at that tells me that it might be better to just have a generic avatar tag and use the other two tags as synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MCeley: Hmmm, didn't think of that (*Y U NO DOWNVOTE?!*). That may be true. Post an answer detailing it, and see how many votes you get.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I use the main sites a lot but rarely use meta. My bad yo!


















I think that in this case, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avataravatar tag should be created and used for both The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra.  Madara's example of having a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naruto-shippuudennaruto-shippuuden tag to tell the two series apart isn't a very good one since everybody just uses the plain Naruto tag for both series.

To deal with differentiating the two series, I propose that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avataravatar be used for both with related synonyms for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avatar-the-last-airbenderavatar-the-last-airbender and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legend-of-korralegend-of-korra.  This way searching "avatar" will yield results for both series as they're both commonly referred to as Avatar and searching for either of the synonyms will give results for those particular series.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you sure that [tag:avatar] will not be used for anything else? Other than The last Airbender or Legend of Korra? Is there no other anime which includes "avatar" in the name?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not exactly a fountain of knowledge when it comes to names of anime/manga but I don't know of any off the top of my head.  I'm sure it could be used for other animes though if they use the word avatar in the name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Using a single tag to reference a series and a contiuation of that series is fine. Using a single tag for a lot of different series is not.


















Since we are looking to expand our social circles I think we should have a name for our unofficial SE community. We can change it later on down the like, but I think we should have something that identifies us as a community.

I'd like like to ask for everyone's idea of what our community name and logo should be and look like. The logo does not need to be the finished product. A rough sketch in paint is fine. I'll work with the author of the top rated answer to create a more polished product.

If you want to just propose a name or logo, that's fine as well.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our "unofficial" community name and logo or mascot be?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should any suggestions have *both* a name and a logo? (i.e. What do we do it we can think of a logo but not a name, or vice-versa?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can post either one or both.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just wanted to drop a quick note saying if you're creating this "unofficial" community identity because of traditions in anime culture, that's great and carry on. If you're doing it because you think you *have* to in order to comply with our trademark guidance on any social media pages you create, that's not exactly true. You can title pages something like "Anime & Manga Stack Exchange Community" and otherwise make it clear that the pages are not run by SE the company, and that's sufficient.


















I suggest that we create a mascot-character, similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aWikipe-tanWikipe-tan or the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-tanOS-tans. Our logo should be designed to incorporate that character. This is a pretty common thing on anime-themed websites, though it's certainly not universal. I thought about drawing something myself, but my artwork is worse than Kobayashi Yuu's drawings, so I'm not the best choice.

We can call her Sachi-tan or something and play it like those after show segments like "Kero's Corner" in CCS. We could call it "Ask Sachi" or something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How about something like an anime tenchou?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer Am I missing something? Why do you want to call her Sachi? lol


















Since anime and manga is a visual medium, would it be a big benefit to add a small image to anime and manga tags (as in, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cowboy-bebopcowboy-bebop tag wiki would have a small image of the series). It would be similar to the small image you see on the wikipedia pages for these anime and manga, small image for Fair Use purposes to help describe the the tag.

I can see where this would help because a promotional picture can sometimes help someone identify which anime they are asking a question about, if they're not sure of the name; though in retrospect, that's probably not likely to happen. 

There may need to be some sort of guidelines so the images aren't huge or spoilery.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it worth adding images to tag wikis?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you mean small icons next to the tag names? Or images inside the tag wiki itself?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha I was referring to the tag wiki itself, didn't know about small icons next to the tag names.


















Helpful images in tag wikis are welcome.

Much like you said, they add a lot in a very visual medium such as anime and manga. Adding images can be a great addition to a tag wiki, for the exact reasons you've listed.

I say go for it! ~♪

Name: "Ask Anime & Manga"

Reasoning:: Got an itching Anime and/or Manga question? We'll try to answer it for you!

https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade and https://scifi.stackexchange.com/Scifi both allow embedding YouTube videos by posting the URL on its own line. I think there is use here for this as well, as long as the moderators and high rep users police the content and make sure it's relevant (which is no different from embedded images). Given that anime is a video medium, it seems rather relevant for us.

I recently asked a question, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2586/24Is there any explanation for "Tequila" in the Kuragehime eyecatch?, which I linked to a 6-second YouTube video. It would be much better if the video were embedded so that people wouldn't have to open a new page just to watch the video.

There was support for this on the https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8468/could-embeded-youtube-video-be-allowedArea51 page, but it never happened. Can we get this turned on?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we get embedded YouTube videos?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This could be abused horribly. If this were to happen, we need to make clear guidelines where embedding a video is OK.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha It seems to work fine on the other sites which have it. I don't think the guidelines need to be any different from our guidelines for embedding images. If people are embedding entire episodes to answer questions, that isn't okay, in the same way that embedding entire manga chapters isn't okay even if the answer is contained therein.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a reputation restriction?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric I could not find any discussion of required reputation to embed videos. I'd assume it's at least the same as images (registered with at least 10 rep) but I could be mistaken.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This may also cause issues with copyrighted material, right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Singer we agreed that we "don't care" about copyright problems unless someone complains. Also, it's YouTube's problem, not ours.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Madara, `we agreed that we "don't care" about copyright problems unless` - I probably missed that. Could you please share a link?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SingerOfTheFall: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/406/122 :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SingerOfTheFall: also: http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/conversation/copyright-material-in-posts-4-chat-castb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even keeping aside the `we don't care about copyright` part, I don't think its a copyright problem, because youtube videos get embedded all over the internet. I don't know how the embedding works on those other SE sites, but as long as the embedded video links back to the Youtube page, it shouldn't cause any problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM There is one significant difference in policing. You don't need to do anything special to see the embedded image, but to decide if a video is appropriate, you would have to buffer it, etc. and watch it for maybe 3 to 5 minutes. However, I do think this would be useful. So I would suggest that the video shouldn't be longer than (say) 60 seconds.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5^ That's just a guideline. If a longer video is required to make the Q or A clear, then the poster has to state so clearly with the reason. Also, if only a specific portion of the video is relevant, state that too (Example: See 1:35 to 2:30, in this video). With that, the above 60 second rule could refer to only the "effective" video length.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@looper, thanks ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai I think any use of video in general needs some explanation. Not just "This video answers your question," but more to the effect of "Here's the clip from episode 638 where the narrator says that Ash is 10 years old." There may be cases where a longer video is needed, but as long as there's an explanation for what the video is supposed to show, it's easy to decide whether or not it's relevant within a few seconds in most cases. I think we'll always have enough active users that someone will notice if a video isn't relevant and flag it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai The only exception I can find to that is if someone embeds something in Japanese without subtitles and with no translation provided. I think we'd frown on that in the same way that we'd frown on an answer in Japanese without any translation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Yes I agree that video-only answers should be treated the same way as link-only answers. But if I want to refer to a 60-second segment in a 10 minute video, I would have to tell you what I am referring to. This is especially true for questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Also I too would like to have the embedded video feature. This [comment](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2578/why-does-chopper-hide-himself-the-wrong-way#comment1778_2579) is one such example. Of course, it is a comment and a side-discussion (not related directly to the question) so a video is not strictly required, but it illustrates why an embedded video could be useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai Naturally for longer videos, the poster should refer to the proper start time of the clip, and ideally also embed the video so that it starts at that time. I'd always prefer if the video was as trimmed as possible though. As you probably already know, even if this gets added we won't have videos in comments, just questions and answers, but there are definitely cases where videos could be useful.


















Should we add the name of the identified series to the list of tags for identifications questions with accepted answers? Would it have any significant impact on SEO?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we add a series tag to identification questions that have accepted answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also [Should we tag story identification questions with the name of the author?](http://meta.scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/671/should-we-tag-story-identification-questions-with-the-name-of-the-author) on [scifi.se]. But note that we do not follow the policy laid out in the highest-scoring answer: we do not retag identification questions based on their answers (and for good reason: it doesn't make much sense to do so).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Btw, we're discussing this in chat right now: http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/8255325#8255325


















Yes
As you mentioned, it will help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
Furthermore, it lets you find all the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions associated with a specific series.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it helps with SEO most of the time, because if the series is obscure enough to need an identification question it probably also will have fewer questions tagged than [tag:identification-request]. But I still see no reason not to do it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, the name of the series will be in the first line of the answer, usually. So that'll come up on a keyword match.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric That works for the SE search. But for a google search, keywords in the answer have very little weight to it. Even keywords in the tag are almost useless, but the automatic appending of the tag to the title will do it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a hard comparison since our StackExchange doesn't come up on Google's first page much yet. But I have definitely seen SO come up with "Top Answer" on Google with the keywords highlighted. Plus, I'm not a huge fan of a policy that says "All ______ questions *must* be edited when answered."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They don't *all* have to be edited. But I'd say it's optional. Do it whenever you want.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is not common practice and it's not consistent with how the SE sites work. Tags classify a question *as is* and not according to its answers. You tag questions, not answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This makes as much sense as tagging all questions on [so] `c#` because it brings more SEO than  `brainfuck`.


















We've had a few questions recently by new users which were well-formed questions that just weren't good matches for our main site. That's understandable, since the askers are often not familiar with how our site works, and we have some rules as to what sorts of questions are allowed that might be stricter from different sites. For instance, we https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117/should-we-allow-recommendation-questionsdon't allow recommendation questions and our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-sitepolicy on questions asking for lists is fairly complicated.

Recently, people have been downvoting these questions. An example* is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2645/im-looking-for-a-list-of-humorous-anime-similar-to-oruchuban-ebichuhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2645/im-looking-for-a-list-of-humorous-anime-similar-to-oruchuban-ebichu. This is a well-written question which is interesting, but doesn't meet our site criteria. So it should be closed. But downvoting in this case will only drive away a new user who could probably productively contribute to our community. It's currently at -4, though I'm contemplating upvoting it just because I don't agree this question should be at -4.

A downvote essentially conveys the message "you should have asked a better question," but the only way the user could know that question was bad is if they had read some obscure meta thread with only about 100 views. Practically speaking, a meta post with 100 views has only been seen by at most 21% of our current registered users. Expecting new users to read every meta thread just to ask one question is ridiculous, especially since many of them don't even know we have a meta site.

When the asker makes these sorts of honest mistakes, you should leave a comment explaining (nicely) why the question isn't a good match for our site (referencing the relevant meta posts), and direct them to chat where such questions are welcome. If there is already such a comment, upvote it. If you can vote to close, then do so. 

But if the only way the user could know that the question wasn't allowed is to be an active user here (and they aren't) then don't downvote it. New users will see this as an attack on themselves and will be unlikely to return, and we aren't anywhere near the size that we can afford to be turning away interested new users.

There are cases when a new user's question is completely out of order. These are things like spam, "What's your favorite X?" questions, and questions which violate the Stack Exchange Terms of Service (e.g. posting pornographic images). In these cases it's acceptable to downvote, though you should still probably explain why in the latter two cases. But if the user has just misunderstood our site's particular policies, downvoting them is only more likely to convince them that they are being attacked, which will just make things worse.

tl;dr: Don't downvote new users who make understandable mistakes, but do point them to our policies so that they won't make the same mistakes again.

*: Yes, I'm aware that the OP in this case has been on our site since private beta, but he clearly isn't an avid user. For all intents and purposes he's basically a new user.

I agree. Be gracious, be professional. Don't drive away users. Be patient towards them, explain their mistakes, refer them to the FAQ and /about page if necessary. 

If you aren't sure, flag it for moderator attention and we'll handle it. 

In general, don't be trigger happy with downvotes, prefer comments and communication. 

Downvotes are reserved for posts which aren't helpful, badly formatted or aren't clear.

I have been working with American colleagues for over 2 years, and once you get over the initial hurdles, timezone doesn't really matter, and you even feel like you are buddy-buddy with the other guys in the same room (though only for an hour or so). :) Besides, there are a number of Asians in this community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There was no concern over you being in a non-American time zone in terms of getting this done (that is essentially a non-issue). We were actually just trying to figure out how to contact you to ask if you were still interested in this. If you're reading the chat backlogs then it's irrelevant anyway.


















I thought about it some more, and I realise that it could be a culture we subconsciously carried over from StackOverflow. SO is categorized under Technology, while this SE site comes under recreation. For that reason, Anime.SE should not be all serious business like SO, and should be much more informal. 

A question like How do I write a C program to add 2 and 3? would get heavily downvoted on SO, as it should be, but I think How old is Kakashi before timeskip? isn't quite equally bad, relatively speaking. People follow anime and manga for fun and entertainment, and not to pass some university test (not that I know of anyway). 

In any case, prefer resolving any issues by posting comments and working with the OP. Not only does that create a positive atmosphere for new users, but also introduces the site policies to them in a non-confrontational way.

I'm actually the poster of the question under discussion here. While I may not post much on this particular network, I have been using the stack exchange networks for quite a while now and I do regularly browse these pages. The problem is, the anime network really doesn't work like the others do. The purpose of these networks is supposed to be to disseminate information on specific areas of interest of which this one is supposed to be about ANIME- Shock Horror. I'd like to assume that most people who frequent this forum or QnA or whatever you want to call it-enjoy anime. So, when a unique question comes in that facilitates knowledge of another aspect of anime it would be gladly welcomed. This doesn't seem to be the case and I feel that it is undermining what is potentially a good site.

My question mentioned above perhaps could have been written a little better, I wanted to know of anime that were of a similar genre to ebichu, but I used the word humor instead. My bad. Humor is subjective, genre isn't. Regardless, it was a question that I would have liked answered and it met the rules stipulated on https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-sitethis page.

This is a new network and it will have it's teething problems, but if it is to meet the high criteria set by the stackexchange network it really needs to have a clear purpose with rules that enforce the purpose of the site and users that know when to enforce them.
Over-regulation will help no one. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think another separate look at this question is warranted. I suspect there is a way to make it into one that is allowable. That should probably go in its own meta post, as that isn't what this discussion is about. As you say, we're having some trouble applying the rules universally and consistently, and they probably should be changed and/or simplified. I'll bring up the issue at the next chat event, but you're free to make a meta post about it sooner.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I opened a [meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/444/how-to-reasonably-scope-a-list-question-asking-for-anime-of-humor-genre) to discuss this question, and see if/how it could be reopened. Please feel free to join the discussion.


















Questions about anime in general are allowed, and encouraged. We don't need in-universe questions only.

Look at the FAQ for example:


  Anime and Manga - Stack Exchange is a Q&A site for enthusiastic anime
  and manga fans. This includes questions about:
  
  
  Plot, character, or setting explanations
  Historical or societal context of an anime or manga
  Anime and manga identification
  Franchise/series reading or viewing order
  Anime and manga production
  Tropes, terminology and other general anime and manga related information.
  


Not all of these are directly on specific anime.

The second example you gave is a list question, we've had a chat discussion over it and defined rules about questions whose answer is a list. You can read it here: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-siteWhat is the status of list questions on this site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That answers it thanks allot ^^


















The question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2645/im-looking-for-a-list-of-humorous-anime-similar-to-oruchuban-ebichuhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2645/im-looking-for-a-list-of-humorous-anime-similar-to-oruchuban-ebichu led to a debate on the correct interpretion of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-siteour policy on list questions. To avoid taking that debate all over the place, I opened this meta thread.

I copy the list questions policy below, along with my interpretation for this question, starting with the least controversial criteria.


  The list items can be determined objectively. Don't ask about a list of our favorite things, or things we think are "good".  


The list can be determined objectively, but we only need to be clear on what we want to determine. Specifically, we need to get more clarity on what "anime that is similar in humor" part of the question means.


  The list isn't prone to rapid change. If the list is hard to maintain, it won't be, thus losing its usefulness.


If/when we figure out the reasonable scope for humor, the list won't change rapidly.


  The list is reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire wiki-page listing your answer, the question is not reasonably scoped.


The list would be reasonably scoped once we resolve the ambiguity about the "anime that is similar in humor" part as mentioned above.


  It is specific and to the point. Don't ask about list of abstract concepts or anime series featuring some theme.


With the way the question is currently worded, this seems the hardest to meet, because it asks for abstract concepts. 

This is my interpretation of what needs to be resolved to reopen this question.

Edit
A number of contrasting responses, but I think we overall agree that:
Either the list questions should be disallowed altogether, or the rule needs to be refined so that it can be applied objectively. 

Let us discuss this further in chat. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to reasonably scope a list question asking for anime of humor genre?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, except with the order of "most controversial". But you've made some solid points here. I feel like the question has all the necessary components to be reopened if it is rephrased properly.


















I honestly don't think there's much room for discussion here. What's funny to me isn't funny to you. Humor and humor types cannot be determined objectively (such as, what anime contain zombies?, for example). 

Therefore, it fails at your first listed criterion. We can't, and definitely won't, define the term "humor". 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are [comedic genres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedic_genres) though. I am sure neither you nor I won't find *all* of them funny, but if a question asks for anime of a specific genre, it could meet our objectivity criteria. Can *this* specific question be edited to meet our criteria? I cannot tell, since I haven't watched the anime.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai Ebichu contains a lot of sex jokes, whether they're about sex itself or sexual body parts. That's most likely the kind of humor the OP was looking for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think we have to define humor. As Deidara-senpai said, there is a *comedy genre*. In addition to that, this is a specific type of humor: Jokes about sex(ual things). That is a quantifiable thing; whether I find sex jokes funny or not does not decide whether or not it's comedy. (I loathe the humor in *Big Bang Theory*, but many people find it funny. Either way, it's a comedy.)


















If you're asking whether we should add tags with the series to identification questions, then the answer is no, this is as far as I know the usual practice on the SE sites.

Tags should classify questions, not questions-after-they-have-been-answered. If the OP didn't know it was that series, then you should not add the tag. It would make the question silly (the asker doesn't know the series but the tag is there).

The keywords in the answers are enough.

Answering to comments: First of all the fact that tags appear in the question. Answers do not carry tags, so tagging a question according to its answers has no logic. Second, the tags appearing on a question, classify it: what it's about, etc. But the OP cannot tag something which he's asking. Consider this: if a user asks about a proper sentence in a language and his example has a mistake, do you fix his mistake in the question? No, because then the question would not make sense anymore.

The reason why I supported the retagging is because it aids in searchability without any drawbacks. If you can provide this evidence we'll happily reverse the decision.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial I added the reply to your comment in my answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this. Retagging a question should happen when the *question* should have been tagged that way in the first place (i.e. the OP wasn't aware of the tag or tagged wrongly). Tagging based on the answer seems silly to me.


















No, you should not. People who are searching for identification questions do not know the name of the series. Classifying identification questions under the name of the series, as opposed to under a theme tag (e.g. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/robotsrobots) or under https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, would be counter-productive.

How does it actively harm the site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial It's counter-productive because you're making the question more visible to the people who don't need it and less visible to the people who do need it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"People who are searching for identification questions do not know the name of the series." - is this always true?

Yes, in that case the series tag should be there from the start.


















Others have addressed the whole "Tags identify attributes of the question" already, so let me piggy-back a bit on https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/435/should-we-add-a-series-tag-to-identification-questions-that-have-accepted-answer/447#447the point from Gilles.

Certainly, having a tag in the title will increase searchability... based on including that tag's content in the search string. Which is where the logic of its benefit is starting to fall into a logic gap for me.

The entire class of question is based on the premise that the title is an unknown element - that's the whole purpose behind asking the question. Furthermore, it is knowledge of the title which is, entirely, the solution to the problem at hand. Thus, knowing the title invalidates the need to ask the question entirely.

Adding the solution to the searchability means that we increase the visibility of... nothing. The question is of absolutely no use to those who already know what the name of the series is, by virtue of the fact that the sole and complete contribution of the solution is the name of the series. The people who can search for the title gain absolutely no benefit to finding this content, since this will not be a problem they are searching for. If anything, it may even be problematic as this will turn up as a search result for unrelated inquiries they happen to be asking about the series itself, giving them worthless data.

To those who do have the same problem, it provides no benefit. They cannot take advantage of the increased searchability because they don't know the title that they can use to help locate the question.



Internal to the system and stepping out of the Google search implications, tags serve to identify what the problem is about, so that questioners can find people with the same problem, and that answerers can identify places that their expertise is needed. There is a difference between "What a problem is about", and "What a problem is solved by" - especially since the latter may have more than one component. This is why we only tag based on the former concept - if we tagged on every potential solution to each problem, then tags would be bloated with excess information that makes finding things more difficult. To further in this point, tags are only an attribute to the question, not to its answers, and thus the logic of tying a tag to its question is written into the system.

For programmers, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/109121/proper-use-of-tags-to-enhance-or-only-to-describe-question/109127#109127a Stack Overflow style example of this argument can be found here. It can be read on a more general component even if you're not a programmer, but if you don't feel like breezing through that, that's fine.

Think outside the context of identification, and put aside the issue of tag granularity for this example - a problem about how to shoot Gohma in the eye when her claw is blocking it is fundamentally different from a problem about how to open the door to Undine's lair, which involves shooting a statue in plain sight in the eye. That they both involve shooting things in the eye does not cause the latter to be grouped with the former on the grounds of shooting things in the eye, because the latter is not a question about shooting things in the eye, but about accessing lairs. You would not tag the latter question with a tag about shooting things in the eye. If there was an alternate entrance to Undine's lair involving bombing cracked walls, then that makes a tag about shooting things in the eye even less applicable because it may not even be necessary. Arrows will be the optimal solution because bombs are extremely expensive and heavy, and thus that is the accepted answer, but that still doesn't make it a component for the tagging. Tagging it as such would only make the whole system confusing.

To use a less confounding example, if that was hard to follow, if someone needs to accomplish Task X, and the solution, wholly and straightforward, is to use Strategy Y, then this is not a problem that is about Strategy Y. We would not classify Task X under Strategy Y because people who are looking for problems about Strategy Y would not be looking for Task X - Task X is already a solved problem for them by virtue of them knowing Strategy Y. We especially would not classify Task X under Strategy Y if there was also a Strategy Z that was equally capable of accomplishing Task X. Then Strategy Y isn't even necessary for Task X, and people who are seeking Task X wouldn't know to search for Strategy Y (or Strategy Z). Had they known to search for those, they probably wouldn't need to ask about Task X in the first place.



That's rather the whole of it. The searchability benefits don't really manifest to anyone's favor as they don't increase visibility to those who would need to find it. Questioners won't know to look for the series as that is the item they are wholly seeking. Answerers won't look for the series because seeing that present is a clear sign that their help isn't even needed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 I like this argument. But now I'm feeling the same thing as Krazer did in chat as we're basically back to square one since ther isn't much to gain or lose with adding the tags.


















I largely agree with this point of view. However...

I don't really agree with the order you've placed them in in terms of controversy. I would do it as follows (again, least problematic criteria first):
4. Scope

The list is reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire wiki-page listing your answer, the question is not reasonably scoped.

"Anime" is a long list. "Anime Comedies" is a shorter list, and "[Consistently] Suggestive Anime" is even shorter. There will not be a huge list of "Anime that makes Comedy of Suggestive Material".
3. Rapid Change

The list isn't prone to rapid change. If the list is hard to maintain, it won't be, thus losing its usefulness.

Anime do come out in significant numbers per year, but this is a rather esoteric category (see above) and not a lot of new anime will be coming out here at a consistent rate.
2. Specificity

It is specific and to the point. Don't ask about list of abstract concepts or anime series featuring some theme.

This hits the second point of "featuring some theme." However, I think genres need to not be considered themes; "funny" (comedic) anime should not be a theme, nor should adventure anime, fantasy anime, etc.
1. "Recommendation"

The list items can be determined objectively. Don't ask about a list of our favorite things, or things we think are "good".

This seems the hardest to discern from this question. The way it is currently phrased suggests that the OP is asking for questions which are suggestive and humorous to us. Based on his comments, and a bit of reading the line, I believe it's fair to say that he is asking for questions which fit into the comedy genre, and the comedy style of which is sexual and suggestive.

After some thought, I've rewritten the question into one which I believe complies with all four criteria above.

What are some anime that make comedy out of suggestive situations and themes?
One of the funniest anime I've ever watched was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oruchuban_EbichuOruchuban Ebichu. It's about a talking hamster, but I mostly enjoyed it due to the adult comedy:
This show seems to fall into the genre of "comedy" as well as "adult", but in a rather odd way: The comedy in the series largely stems from making jokes about sexual innuendo and suggestive themes.

The show is done in a simplistic art style, and its sexual content is played for laughs rather than for fanservice.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oruchuban_Ebichu(Wikipedia)

Is there a list of anime which employ this type of comedy? At present, the only one I can think of is potentially http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Boy_(manga)Golden Boy.

What I've done here is try to remove any reference to "humor", instead going for the concept of "comedy"; when a comedy is made, it is intended to make people laugh, even if it does not succeed. It still remains a comedy, regardless.

This answer got longer than I anticipated, so:
TL;DR: In my opinion, this issue is not about defining humor: It's about realizing that humor is subjective, while the genre that a show fits into is actually objective.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I ordered "least controversial" in the context of applying them to *this* question (from my perspective, anyway), but that isn't too important. The key point is that it comes down to how well we can define the *genre*. So I think we are making progress in terms of resolving this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Deidara-senpai That's what I was going for as well. Now that I think of it, order isn't really too important as long as we can address the issue underlying each point.


















I think a case can be made that this question could be made to fit our current rules. However, I think that's not because the question is good, but our current rules are bad. There's no reasonable way to make this question objective and reasonably scoped simultaneously.

I'm mostly opposed to our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-siteprevious agreement on list questions, at least as a be-all and end-all policy. If we all agreed on what it meant and applied it uniformly, then it would be an okay policy. But we still have high-rep users debating over the policy even though it's been in place for almost a month. I have my own interpretation for what it means, but there's no reason it should be the same as anyone else's interpretation. If I posted a question that I thought was perfectly allowable and others didn't, it would lead to some debate. I'd be okay in the end, but for a new user, they can easily get hurt feelings over these kinds of things and leave the site. Even when we agree that we're properly applying this policy, the OP probably doesn't, and there's lots of room for confusion and hurt feelings.

What we need is a simple policy that can be understood by everyone and clearly applied. The current policy on list questions allows some good questions, but it becomes a point of debate whenever we have anything controversial. Almost all of these controversial questions are asking for lists of anime/manga, and almost all questions asking for lists of anime is controversial. Hence, seeing no better alternative, I propose the following policy change: 


  Questions asking for lists out-of-universe, e.g. lists of anime, manga, etc. are banned. This includes questions asking for examples of a particular genre/theme/trope.


This is the policy on https://scifi.stackexchange.com/faqScifi and they don't seem to have problems with it. I think in-universe list questions are a different animal, and our current policy seems to be serving them well.

This is very simple to apply, though there are a few cases that you have to be careful. For instance, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2351/24Has an anime ever come out before the manga was published? is not a list question, even though the answers contain lists of anime. It's merely asking if it's possible to have an anime before a manga, and so it's a question about anime production. It would be possible for someone to come up with a totally theoretical answer to the question addressing all of the issues associated with producing original anime, but without any examples. This question should maybe be protected to prevent further answers that just list examples, but it isn't a list question so it should be left open. That's just how the answerers chose to answer the question.

Contrast that to the question we're looking at right now. There's no reasonable way to change the question into something that doesn't violate this policy. There isn't any minor modification that could be made to comply with this policy. So we would not allow that question. This policy would also affect some other older questions which were reopened after the original list question proposal.

It's worth looking at the questions which we'd be losing if we adopted this. After browsing the ones on the main site, none were questions that I'd be particularly upset to see go (feel free to comment if you think I've missed one). Most of them were either bad questions or tolerable questions that weren't interesting to very many people. The one that I'd be most upset about losing was the hypothetical question that I posed originally to show that there were good list questions:


What are all the anime films that were directed by Hayao Miyazaki?


This is actually a red herring. It was not asked on the main site, and for good reason-the answer is trivial to find. It's already on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki#FilmographyWikipedia, exactly as you'd expect it would be. This is true in general for most out-of-universe list questions. Those which are "good" questions tend to have answers which are easy to find and verify, to the point that no one would even ask here. Losing these hypothetical "good" questions which are actually trivial isn't something we should worry about, and it's certainly not worth conflicts with new users over confusing policy.

To be clear, I'm proposing this primarily to avoid future conflicts with new users. An unambiguous firm policy that can't be argued one way or the other is the best way to do this.



tl;dr These sorts of questions aren't very interesting, and they lead to debate even among high rep users. Rather than allowing them in certain complicated situations, we should ban them altogether to avoid conflicts of opinion and simplify the rules.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you but I really think you should bold your key points or add a summary, lol.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza I tried to do both. Hopefully it is more readable now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure I agree with this. Lists are a form of identification request, and are a practical and answerable question if phrased right. I do not believe that a sweeping iron fist of "Lists are not allowed" is justified or necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric Naturally, nothing is necessary. We can keep having these arguments every time a question like this is asked. But a policy that we can't figure out how it's supposed to work after a month is a terrible policy in practice even if it looks good in theory, and it's clear just from reading this question that we haven't figured it out at all. If you can find a different policy that we can explain to newbies in one sentence and leaves no room for debate, I'm all for it. I could also be convinced this is too extreme if you can provide a single clearly good instance of an out-of-universe list.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can think of a couple *types* (I don't have names to fill in with, just because I'm not vetted in anime producers and such), such as "Which anime films have _A_ and _B_ worked on together?" "What anime has _A_ directed which use only traditional drawing styles (no CG)?" I can think of others, too. I mean, logically, these can be rephrased as "Have _A_ and _B_ done any films together?" But that's just a list in disguise. (As for a different policy, I'll be thinking on it, but I have no suggestions as of now.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric While those are definitely better than the example question I gave assuming they are motivated, I still don't see them as terribly interesting questions, and it doesn't change the fact that *almost all* out-of-universe questions are not very interesting. If we give up a couple of interesting questions and a bunch of not very good ones in order to have a better relationship with new users, that seems like a good trade to me. We've already lost 2 users who were active on other SE sites from our ambiguous policies regarding these questions, and all we've gained are a few mediocre questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll just add that the policy on almost every SE site I know of prohibits these types of questions. [Arqade](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/faq) bans "catalogue questions", Scifi is already referenced above. I highly doubt most of the technical sites would allow questions like this; the SO analogue is something like "List of Programming Languages with property X," which I haven't seen anything like. Even [RPG](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/faq), which *allows* recommendation questions still doesn't want questions where the answers are a list of games.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You bring up several good points. We should either disallow these questions entirely, or have an *objective* way to define what lists are allowed and not. It cracks me up thinking that a rule with the word *objectively* in bold needs to be interpreted subjectively.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 FYI, SFF [does allow](http://meta.scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/2638/are-all-list-questions-off-topic) _some finite_ list questions.


















No.
I've never had an anime song I couldn't Google lyrics for, and translation is definitely off-topic.
I would say it is on-topic to ask the name of a particular theme song from an anime. Some of these, particularly from less well-known anime, can be hard to find online. But from there, it is the OP's responsibility to find the lyrics themselves (animelyrics.com is a good resource).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, of course. But aren't we targeting users to use our site instead of other sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@xjshiya Of course. But many, if not most, songs were made independent of the anime and are not directly linked to it. "What song was used in X anime" is an anime-related question; "What is X quality of an anime theme song" is not. (This would be akin to asking for translations of episode content.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah I see your point. But if there exist a case where the song is related to the anime and requires explanation, can it be allowed then?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@xjshiya If you have the lyrics and ask how they related to the anime in some way, I would see that as being on-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's better to be clear. Thanks a lot. :)


















I just asked a question that was about Ouran High School Host Club. The tag for that did not exist before so I tagged it as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ohshcohshc, which is one way that it is commonly known. It is also commonly known as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ouranouran, but the technical correct tag from the name would be https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ouran-high-school-host-clubouran-high-school-host-club. That seems a bit too long, though. What should we put it as?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which tag should we use? [ouran-high-school-host-club] vs [ouran] vs [ohshc]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's what synonyms are for.

Hence full English series name isn't an option.


















To avoid confusion and lets try https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ouran-koukou-host-clubouran-koukou-host-club, since it fits,

We should only abbreviate if the title is way too long.

Anime/Manga recommendation questions (list or not) should, IMO, be expressly considered off topic. Most questions on "anime with a particular theme" can usually be answered by simply clicking on a tag in your favourite anime/manga database. In the case of the question, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2825/titles-where-characters-are-in-trapped-in-a-gamehttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2825/titles-where-characters-are-in-trapped-in-a-game , the tag is usually something along the lines of "play or die" and some combination of "game" or "video game".

While there should be the proverbial exception to any restrictive rule, it's best, IMO, to keep recommendation questions at a safe distance from this site. If they do have to be exceptionally accommodated, it should be achieved by rewording the question appropriately to fit within the rules of the site.

The series Hentai Ōji to Warawanai Neko. is a light novel series which is being turned into an anime this spring. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_%22Hentai%22_Prince_and_the_Stony_Cat.Wikipedia:


  The "Hentai" Prince and the Stony Cat. (変態王子と笑わない猫。 Hentai Ōji to Warawanai Neko.), also known by the shorthand HenNeko (変猫。) and Towanai (とわない), is a Japanese light novel series written by Sō Sagara and illustrated by Kantoku.


However, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentai-oji-to-warawanai-nekohentai-oji-to-warawanai-neko is too long (28 characters instead of 25). The English name, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-hentai-prince-and-the-stony-catthe-hentai-prince-and-the-stony-cat is as well (35 characters), even if we remove the "the"s (27).

Some suggestions:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hennekohenneko or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hen-nekohen-neko (from Wikipedia).
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/towanaitowanai or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/to-wanaito-wanai (from Wikipedia).
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/oji-to-warawanai-nekooji-to-warawanai-neko ("The Prince and the Stony Cat").


It's worth noting that the word "hentai" is filtered by Google safe-search, which may come into play for reasons of SEO.

What should we call this series's tag?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we tag 'Hentai Ōji to Warawanai Neko.'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that this discussion first came up in chat because I wanted to ask a question about this series.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If they use hentai in the context pervert, why not replace it with Pervert prince ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx Because it's unlikely that anyone who knows the show will think of it by that title.


















After thinking about it overnight, I'm going to suggest https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentai-prince-stony-cathentai-prince-stony-cat, which at 23 characters, just barely fits.

Advantages:


Fairly unambiguous.
Catches all the important English keywords for SEO (even "hentai" though it will still be filtered if the person has safesearch enabled).
Comes up if someone starts typing "hentai" which is the most likely way someone would look for such a tag, regardless of if they were searching for the Japanese or English title.


Disadvantages:


We lose "and" and "the". The result is a minor grammatical abomination.
This isn't any sort of official abbreviation. It's our own creation. I don't know if there's any sort of official policy regarding this, but it is a bit problematic in my opinion.
We don't get any traffic from people searching for the Japanese title. In my experience that is more common than the English name. However, that's to be expected since the light novel community is quite a bit more fluent at Japanese than the anime community at large, and this novel hasn't been translated. There is no way that I know of to predict whether the Japanese or English name will be more popular in my opinion. 




EDIT: In the past couple of days, I've seen quite a bit more news about this series. The common English-language sources seem to be using HenNeko as an official abbreviation. I think it's likely that this abbreviation will catch on in the English community in the same way that OreImo did.

My viewpoint is that if there's a common and official abbreviation, we should go with that when both the full English and Japanese names don't fit rather than making our own. This might hurt search traffic, but there's no perfect solution. For all we know it could help search traffic.

Hence, I've retagged my single question on the series as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hennekohenneko. I propose we make two tag synonyms in this case, namely https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentai-prince-stony-cathentai-prince-stony-cat (for those who know the series by its English name) and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentai-oji-warawanai-nekohentai-oji-warawanai-neko (an equivalent grammatical abomination in Japanese which barely fits at 25 characters).

A good tag wiki is a necessity in cases like this, so I'll write one in the near future unless anyone else does so before me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going with this for now. If someone else has a better suggestion in the future we can change it at that time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm good with this also. Do we want any tag synonyms for this, though, since it's a bit of an odd name? Or is the tag wiki sufficient?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5henneko seems fine.


















Different opinion: After seeing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2825/titles-where-characters-are-in-trapped-in-a-gamehttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2825/titles-where-characters-are-in-trapped-in-a-game - which fits all of our current list criteria, I have to say that I think list questions in general are a bad idea.

Look at both of the answers for that question. Which one is better? Why? The best answer to a list question would be a community answer where everyone inputs their own contribution for one full list. But as it is now, aren't list questions just a contest of who can answer first or who has the longer list?

Maybe it's just me, but I think something like that shouldn't be the criteria for a good answer on SE.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel like having multiple lists isn't a bad idea. Future viewers of the questions can upvote the ones they feel gave them the best choices, and the OP can accept the one that fit closest to what he expected (and yielded an anime/manga he liked).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric That's part of my concern - For example, what part of going to AniDB, copying as many titles as you can from the "Virtual Reality" tag list, and pasting them here makes something a good answer? What if I copy the previous answer and add one or two of my own answers? Does that make my answer THAT much better?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the real issue is that we haven't defined the rules well enough. Furthermore, we haven't been applying it consistently. I don't think we want to go with a blanket ban on list questions though. Since I see no issue with questions such as, "Who are the all the super-saiyans in DBZ?" - which is very answerable and constructive.


















I don't know how specific you're looking for, but I think that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/69/what-differentiates-anime-from-regular-cartoonsWhat differentiates anime from regular cartoons? and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/836/do-people-in-the-anime-or-manga-actually-eat-pokemonDo people in the anime or manga actually eat Pokemon? should be included because the first is something that interested people should know and the second is something that a lot of people are curious about. They are also the two highest rated questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We already tried the pokemon one on reddit r/pokemon. It didn't get much momentum. As for the anime vs. cartoon one... I don't think that's the kind of question we want to promote too much of.


















The following is taken mostly from my answer at https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/444/how-to-reasonably-scope-a-list-question-asking-for-anime-of-humor-genreHow to reasonably scope a list question asking for anime of humor genre?, though I've incorporated some ideas from atlantiza's and coleopterist's answers on https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-siteWhat is the status of list questions on this site? as well. In some cases I've quoted word-for-word from my own writing without indicating the original source (the answer linked above), to preserve the flow of the writing and limit the amount of new text needed to compose this answer.



The main difficulty with our policy on list questions in my view is #2, though the other points also have some problems. But #2 is the most problematic in my view. Here it is:


  The list items can be determined objectively. Don't ask about a list of our favorite things, or things we think are "good".


What's the trouble with this, you ask? One is that it isn't exactly clear what constitutes "objective". But the worse problem is that it isn't strong enough. What we actually want isn't that the individual items of the list can be determined objectively. That's fairly easy to do by defining terms sufficiently well. But even if that's the case, we can still run into cases where people post different lists, each of which contains many of the examples of whatever is being asked about, but not all of them. Then it again becomes a subjective "which list do I think is better?" type of question.

Rather than imposing criteria on the individual elements of the list, we should be imposing the objectivity criterion on the list as a whole. That is to say, we should require that the lists are arguably complete, and that no more examples beyond what is listed exist. This is a much stronger condition in practice, and it's the only way these questions can avoid having the exact same problems of subjectivity and list maintenance as recommendation questions.

However, it's not a viable policy in practice. The difficulty is that very few lists are likely to satisfy it, especially if we're talking about out-of-universe lists. The only exceptions are things like "What are all the movies that Hayao Miyazaki has directed?" which tend to not be very interesting. The difficulty is that you necessarily need another source to confirm that the list is complete. There are very few sources like that, and all of them are well-known (e.g. in this case, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki#FilmographyWikipedia). If we required this, the only sorts of answers that would be possible are essentially link-only answers. What's more, an external reference, while a good argument that an answer is complete, can still have errors. So that isn't a real solution. It's also even harder than our current policy to apply uniformly.

What we need is a simple policy that can be understood by everyone and clearly applied. The current policy on list questions allows some good questions, but it becomes a point of debate whenever we have anything controversial. Almost all of these controversial questions are asking for lists of anime/manga, and almost all questions asking for lists of anime is controversial. Hence, seeing no better alternative, I propose the following policy change: 


  Questions asking for lists out-of-universe, e.g. lists of anime, manga, etc. are banned. This includes questions asking for examples of a particular genre/theme/trope.


This is the policy on https://scifi.stackexchange.com/faqScifi and they don't seem to have problems with it. https://gaming.stackexchange.com/faqArqade has a similar policy as well. I could not find any graduated SE sites that would allow questions analogous to our questions asking for lists of anime. In fact, I also couldn't find any beta sites which would have allowed these. Admittedly I didn't look terribly hard, but I still think the point stands.

This is very simple to apply, though there are a few cases that you have to be careful. For instance, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2351/24Has an anime ever come out before the manga was published? is not a list question, even though the answers contain lists of anime. It's merely asking if it's possible to have an anime before a manga, and so it's a question about anime production. It would be possible for someone to come up with a totally theoretical answer to the question addressing all of the issues associated with producing original anime, but without any examples. This question should maybe be protected to prevent further answers that just list examples, but it isn't a list question so it should be left open. That's just how the answerers chose to answer the question.

Contrast that to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2645/im-looking-for-a-list-of-humorous-anime-similar-to-oruchuban-ebichuhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2645/im-looking-for-a-list-of-humorous-anime-similar-to-oruchuban-ebichu. There's no reasonable way to change the question into something that doesn't violate this policy. There isn't any minor modification that could be made to comply with this policy. So we would not allow that question. This policy would also affect some other older questions which were reopened after the original list question proposal.

It's worth looking at the questions which we'd be losing if we adopted this. After browsing the ones on the main site, none were questions that I'd be particularly upset to see go. There was not a single question in this category, after over a month and a half of this policy, which was interesting to me. Naturally, this is subjective, but I suspect most will agree with me on this. Most of them were either bad questions or tolerable questions that weren't interesting to very many people. It's worth pointing out that this is coming from someone with, as of right now, https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/24/logan-m300 question votes (the second most on the site), so my criteria for interesting content aren't terribly strict.

My feeling is that if we've generated a half-dozen or so bad-to-mediocre questions of this type, and 0 good ones, it just isn't a good type of question. You can probably come up with special cases where such questions might actually be interesting, but no one has asked any. If they are common enough that we should allow the bad questions just so that the few good ones can also have a home here, then why haven't any of these been asked? In any case, making a policy based on questions that have not been asked, when we have a problem with what is being asked, is a bad idea.

Furthermore, as I mentioned above, questions of this type tend to already be answered at one of the standard references. No one is going to come here asking "What are all the movies Miyazaki directed?". They'll use Google, or go to Wikipedia, or some anime-specific resource.  Losing these hypothetical "good" questions which are actually trivial isn't something we should worry about, and it's certainly not worth conflicts with new users over confusing policy.



tl;dr These sorts of questions aren't very interesting, and they lead to debate even among high rep users. Rather than allowing them in certain complicated situations, we should ban them altogether to avoid conflicts of opinion and simplify the rules. 

Note also that these sorts of things are great for the http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/7576/recommendations-and-reviewsRecommendations and Reviews chatroom. If a user wants to ask these sorts of questions, I'd advise directing them there.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I had thought about revising policy too. However, I had not thought about banning those questions, like you propose. But after reading your post, I have to say you do make some good points, especially the 'making a policy based on questions that have not been asked, when we have a problem with what is being asked, is a bad idea' part. I agree with you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Let's wait to see what others have to say on this before making any changes. I was pretty reluctant to propose an all-out ban on these questions but I could not see any better alternative. If anyone has a less restrictive alternative which is clear both to new users and high rep users, I'd personally rather go with that, but I was not able to come up with any such policy.


















Here are my suggestions. These are based on three principles, namely that A) a tag should be something that someone could legitimately be an expert on, B) tags should not be prone to misuse, and C) we should not have two tags with identical or nearly identical scopes. I've also only commented on tags that I think are not likely to generate a lot of debate; those tags would be better discussed on their own individual posts.


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/productionproduction seems redundant, as we already have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production. The two open questions on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/productionproduction could both be retagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production. The closed one is about Visual Novel production. If the tag were going to be used for questions about production of media other than anime and manga, I'd say keep but rename. As it is now, I say merge with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production (and remove from the VN question). /questions/tagged/status-completestatus-complete
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics is a borderline case. I don't see much reason to keep it, but I also don't see much reason to get rid of it. I'll abstain on this one.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic can probably stay. The only question is whether https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/theme-songtheme-song are different enough to warrant having two separate tags. However, of the 4 questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/theme-songtheme-song, 3 of them aren't solely about the music from the song, so I say keep both tags.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology is a strange one. The wiki description says it's to be used both for real-world technology and in-universe technology, which obviously are very different things. I say we make it only for in-universe technology. If there are any real-world technology questions which are on topic on this site, we should make a separate tag for them, but if not then we can get rid of it. I'm not really opposed to getting rid of the tag entirely either, but I'll abstain on that point. /questions/tagged/status-completestatus-complete Changed tag wiki to reflect that.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/voice-actingvoice-acting seems fine to me. Keep.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag probably should be discussed on it's own meta post, but for now I say keep.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/seasonseason No need for this. Burninate. /questions/tagged/status-completestatus-complete
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prequelprequel I don't see what this is good for. Destroy /questions/tagged/status-completestatus-complete
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/originorigin Merge with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history /questions/tagged/status-completestatus-complete
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sound-effectssound-effects The single question tagged with this would be better tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/japanese-languagejapanese-language. In principle I think this tag might be okay, though I suspect it would be a subtag of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/memememe isn't quite the same as any other tags we have, and it's not prone to misuse. We probably won't get many questions on it, but for now I say keep.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mistranslationmistranslation Merge with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/japanese-languagejapanese-language /questions/tagged/status-completestatus-complete - Note that no synonym was made.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fillersfillers I have no opinion on this. Abstain.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novellight-novel It's questionable whether this is necessary. In my opinion this should be discussed at https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/275/add-light-novel-to-tag-blacklistAdd "light-novel" to tag blacklist rather than here.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/live-actionlive-action is similar to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novellight-novel. It should be discussed individually on a separate post.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-historymanga-history I propose that we merge this, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/game-historygame-history into a broad https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/historyhistory tag. There isn't too much potential for misuse of such a tag, and there isn't much difference in the scope of these tags.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/currently-airingcurrently-airing Kill. Too prone to misuse, and there aren't many other questions that can be asked about this. The one question with this tag should be retagged, but none of the existing tags works. I suggest https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-resourcesanime-resources for these sorts of questions. That, or we could move it to meta as an FAQ question.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/doujinshidoujinshi Again similar to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novellight-novel. This should get it's own meta post.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fillersfillers I'll abstain, though I lean towards getting rid of it slightly.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/game-historygame-history see above.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/censorshipcensorship is probably okay, though it's almost a subtag of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production. keep
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/conventionsconventions My trouble with this is, are there any on-topic questions about conventions? If there are, we can keep it. If not, we should get rid of it. The only currently tagged question is closed, though it might be a candidate for reopening.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/copyrightcopyright seems fairly broadly off-topic. There are a few questions one can ask about copyright that are on-topic here, but I think it's few enough that we don't need a tag for it. Leaning towards kill, though I'm a bit iffy on this one.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/crossoverscrossovers I see no problem with this one, except that a couple of questions that could be tagged with this aren't. Keep.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/amvamv AMVs usually refers to fan productions which are not official. I think they are almost entirely off-topic here. It can very rarely refer to officially produced AMVs by studios, but that is not the norm. As such, I say kill.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/analysisanalysis seems to have been added in the early days, perhaps from https://movies.stackexchange.com/Movies & TV where it is a common tag. However, I think there is no need for it here. Kill. /questions/tagged/status-completestatus-complete
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animation-mistakesanimation-mistakes I guess I'm okay with. Keep.




Since this is a very long post and most of the disagreement is likely to be over a small number of tags, I'd suggest voicing any disagreement as a separate answer rather than a comment here so that it can be properly voted on.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with all. To add onto a few... Kill [analysis] as is an entirely non-constructive tag. Keep [anime-physics] since it is definitely the subject of a lot of "WTF"s in anime. [retag] needs to remain, I think, to keep newbies from tagging it with "whatever". I'd say burn [technology] as I don't think many in-universe tags will be helpful--technology changes between universes. [season] and [prequel]... just WTF... kill. I think I missed one I was going to mention, but I'm running out of characters anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with the answer, and with @Eric's comment. Pretty good job :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good compilation. I agree with nearly everything you say (and seems like the rest agree as well). I'll get on it soon.


















Back in private beta, we discussed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/156/274a proposal on whether we should allow a limited set of "resource" posts to be available, just like https://japanese.meta.stackexchange.com/q/756/3035meta JLU's. StackOverflow has https://stackoverflow.com/q/3737139/1438733some as well. The purpose of these resource posts is twofold: to help users find useful resources that other community members use, and also to allow us to redirect people who ask disallowed questions (like recommendations) to resources where those are valid.

The proposal was never discussed thoroughly nor concluded, but it is one that should be decided upon by the community. Thus, I've set up this poll so that the community can have a say in how this will be handled. There are three options:

Option 1: Allow the posts on Meta


The posts will be allowed on the meta Anime & Manga site.
These posts will be locked or wiki'd and protected (depending on context).
Users who ask questions which are covered by the resources will have questions closed as usual, then get a comment linking them to said post.


Option 2: Allow the posts on Main


The posts will be allowed on the main Q&A portion of the Anime & Manga site.
These posts will be locked or wiki'd and protected (depending on context).
Users who ask questions which are covered by the resources will have questions closed as a duplicate of the resource question.


Option 3: Disallow the posts


There will be no resource posts allowed on Meta or Main.


To vote, please upvote the answer whose option you agree with. You should not downvote other answers, as downvotes will not be counted.

Any additional points can be edited into or commented on their respective option post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we handle posts containing anime & manga resources?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think resource requests should belong on the main site. Often times these types of questions are not constructive or not a real question, because they don't fit SE's Q&A model. Often times asking for a solution to a problem is often times better than a reference. By allowing these, we have to make the effort to maintain these lists and make sure they are up-to-date. We also have to make sure that the given subject matter is canonical. Trying to maintain these questions as they come along may require a lot of effort from both users moderators and can be quite time consuming.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we do allow them we are better off letter users request a resource in meta on a specific topic and getting together and compiling a list we can all agree upon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer The "locked post" reason explicitly states "*but it is not considered a good, on-topic question for this site*" (see: [example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/9033/1438733)). I think it's just better to isolate the knowledge and resources to the main site because that's where people will expect them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By locking it you are essentially admitting that it's not a good question for this site. I personally think that this will set an bad precedence, especially if we allow it on the main site. It's best to keep off-topic questions such as resource requests to a minimum so we don't lose ourselves trying to QC and maintain them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer I disagree. By locking it you're saying it's *not the type of question that we want more of* on the site. I don't think those types of questions will hurt us in the long run (or even the short run).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By locking the question, you're preventing it from being maintained by anyone except moderators. Which kinda kills the point doesn't it? Resource questions on other sites aren't locked. They won't be locked here either.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha [Some are](http://stackoverflow.com/q/9033/1438733).

Plus it's stupid to create questions just to lock them. Locking a question basically says "we wish we could get rid of this but we can't because it used to be allowed and it generated useful responses". It's called a "historic lock" for a reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think I agree with @Krazer on this one. If we're going to allow these at all, it should be on Meta. Frequently updating a meta post is not anywhere near as disruptive as a main site post. It also eliminates the incentive for new users to post and makes it more clear that this is a community undertaking rather than an invitation for everyone to add their own favorite answer. Plus, in my view, the questions are on topic for meta, but they aren't really about anime so they don't belong on main.

So, if you ask 3 questions from series that aren't getting a lot of attention, then don't ask any for a bit (though ones on *Naruto* and stuff would still be fine). Then, as one of the old questions gets answered, you ask a new one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I added My-Hime and My-Otome separately, but My-Otome is a spin-off, so we can possibly put them together. There are also a number of series that have tags but no questions. Do we want them on this list or a separate list for them?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly This list will be fine for those as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will actually amend what I just said--there are a number of series with one question. Should we look for more questions for those or leave them be for right now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly I think the main point of this was to have tags for all the commonly watched series. While you should still ask questions for those if you think of good ones, I don't think it's as important.


















We had a nasty habit spoilerififying practically anything that dates later than the current anime, dating back to the early days of private beta of this site.

We luckily managed to stop that habit (spoiler-marked content is not searchable, hard to find and hard to read). Only spoiler-mark things that would truly ruin someones view experience (A key character's death, identity revelations etc). Since we've already discussed Madara in that question, there's little spoilerify. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To add to this: If a title is a question whose answer is, in itself, a spoiler, the answer *likely* needs no spoiler tags at all, even though it is a spoiler by nature.


















There have been various http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTQYAsUMGFganime and manga on Gundam models and model building. Model building is also a big part of otaku culture.

Is the discussion of Gundam models or model/figures or the activity of building them (as long as they are based on anime or manga series, like Patlabor, Full Metal Panic, or Evangelion) considered on topic on this site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the subject of gunpla, plastic models, or figures on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I actually want to give these a test run and see what happens.


















I'd recommend tagging as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/d.n.angeld.n.angel and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/a.i.-love-youa.i.-love-you. I checked that this works by editing your post; feel free to revert if you don't agree with this.

I didn't think periods would work in tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly I don't blame you, I didn't think they would either. I thought we'd be using [d-n-angel] for sure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't think it would work either until I remembered that Stack Overflow has plenty of tags with periods.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[tag:asp.net] fellas :) An SO user would have knownb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should dot-hack be changed to .hack?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly This change was already made.

To be more precise, there are quite a number of anime/manga that follows http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CypherLanguageCypher Language Trope.

Examples of Cypher Language:

I would like to ask whether asking for exhaustive list is OK, rather than only the substitution chart.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh: I don't see a problem with that. Note that not all users will have time to compile an exhaustive list for you, and you may want to ask a narrower question to get a high quality answer.


















I'll throw my two cents in here:

Don't be afraid to speculate!

Even if your answer isn't "supported by facts" (what facts?, this is anime for crying out loud!), or has a "definite citing source", don't be afraid to give it! If it's speculative by nature, but has good, intelligent arguments that are in your favor, don't be afraid to share it!

The whole point of this site is that multiple answers are posted, and the best one is voted to the top.

Can I have a second opinion?

If you see a question posted, but the answer there doesn't sit well with what you understood of the plot/situation/question, don't be afraid to give your own answer to it!

Leaving a comment is fine, but providing with a full answer to better explain your opinion is better! Who knows? Maybe yours will be voted to the top, if it's better.

Remember that not all is definite

This is anime, not math, there's more than meets the eye, and there's more than one side to any story. Many questions don't have absolute answers as told in the anime or manga, don't be afraid to give your answer, even if it has no definitive proof elsewhere (just make sure to say so!)



All in all

Have fun, this is a recreational site, we value the answerer's opinions as well as their knowledge, remember that there's no such thing as a real "anime expert".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An addendum: Remember that for an answer to "count" in our stats, it either has to be accepted or +1'd.


















I think it's fine to ask how to decipher encoded text in some anime, as in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/565/what-do-the-runes-say-in-madokaWhat do the Runes say in Madoka?. I also think it would be fine to answer such a question with an exhaustive list of all of the encoded text, though that isn't what was done in this case.

Whether it's appropriate to ask for a full list of deciphered text depends on how much is present in the source and how easy it is to find. In a case like Madoka, this was an effort that required people to go frame-by-frame through the anime to make sure nothing was missed, translating the runes to German, and then getting someone to translate the German to English. The whole process took a lot of people and many hours.

If you're asking someone to do all of that work from scratch, the question isn't reasonably scoped in my opinion*. Questions here should be things that people are able to answer without doing a large amount of work on their own. Practically, what's likely to happen in these cases is that the question just goes unanswered for a long time. On the other hand, if there are only a few instances of encoded text, which are fairly easy to find, and the code is known, I think it's fine.

What exactly constitutes the boundary is up for debate. From https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-siteWhat is the status of list questions on this site?, the criterion for a list question to be reasonably scoped is:


  If you can imagine an entire wiki-page listing your answer, the question is not reasonably scoped.


which I think is reasonable to apply in this case as well.



*I'd make an exception in the case that you are answering your own question. In that case, in my opinion the "reasonably scoped" criterion becomes irrelevant.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think an exhaustive list would draw in traffic. But I also agree that putting it up will require time and effort from whoever that is answering. Not sure whether community wiki would work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh An exhaustive list is great if you want to post it yourself and would probably bring in lots of traffic. It might also work with a community wiki answer, but I think it's more likely the question would just sit unanswered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However, I think it would be fine to divide up the translations into manageable portions (for example, all the instances from 1 episode would probably be acceptable for Madoka, preferably including screencaps). If you are eventually able to translate everything it would then be possible to make 1 large CW post compiling all the translations. But if you're going to do this, to limit the number of unanswered questions, don't post a dozen questions at once; wait and see if the first one gets answered before posting another request.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Questions here should be things that people are able to answer without doing a large amount of work on their own" I think questions that could require some research would arguably be more interesting than most basic questions. I agree that asking someone to translate every encrypted text in a show is asking too much though.


















We are looking for both new people and new series to be on our site. Is there any merit to the idea of asking easy questions, both to pull in new people who might not want to answer more difficult questions and to start off having questions for series that aren't Naruto, Bleach, Dragonball, or One Piece?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we ask easy questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: [Can you ask questions even if the answer is easily found elsewhere?](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/112)


















Bounties

After adding the bounty to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2886/What is the purpose of characters shouting out the name of their attack? the question received 4 more answers not including my own. None of them really got to what I wanted, but at least we got more input on the topic from multiple people.

I think this is a no.

I say this for a few reasons:


It could potentially lead to lots of non-English questions. I think we should try to stick to English as our primary language due to its significant presence throughout existing SE sites (even on language and usage sites).
People coming from a Japanese background will still know rōmaji and have the IMEs to use English. Those of us in English-speaking countries do not always have (easy) access to (for example) Japanese IMEs, so we may not be able to easily search or understand tags.
There are few instances when a tag name is too long. In these cases, unicode may be acceptable (such as changing ou to ō or a similar concept) to make the tag fit into 23 characters.


I don't think we'd benefit at all from the unicode tags, and I think more than anything it could prevent people from finding the tags and questions they're looking for.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to note: This is an English-language forum. Questions posted in other languages would be closed. Including translations is okay, but the text must be available in English.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RobertCartaino: *This is an English-language forum.* *forum* ***forum***. FORUM?! -Twitches Uncontrollably-


















There are a couple things I need to know about how the Unicode tags will work before I can decide if we have use for them. We definitely don't need them, because tagging on our site is functioning decently at the moment, but there are a few issues that these could help with.

1) Will this increase the 25 character limit? If not, it still gives us a couple more characters when using Japanese titles (because of macrons), but not a lot more. That is, of course, assuming we don't use actual Japanese tags, which seems like a good idea since a lot of our users do not read or speak Japanese.

2) How will searching for the unicode characters work? For instance, will it catch tags using "ō" if I search for something with "o"? If not, we'll need synonyms in each of these cases because many of our users are not going to be accustomed to typing strange unicode characters.

The only real issue I have with the tagging system right now is that 25 characters is frequently not enough for us. If this will increase that limit, and the searching is going to remain intuitive for new users, then I'm all for it. Otherwise, I don't think it's a big help to us.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for the search bit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For people who can type Japanese, there is unlikely to be any confusion in tag search. The problem is with the variations in romanization.


















Before the closing of this fine First of April, there are a few https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fruitsfruits questions that have been deemed sub-par and will likely result in closure or deletion (typically the former to allow people to retain their rep).


The following questions will be closed or deleted:

Update -- All of the mentioned question have been closed (excluding the borderline ones), some pending deletion.

I plan on removing the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fruitsfruits tag from non-closed questions after all of this resolves.

If you think a question should be added to this list or that a judgment needs to be appealed, or even if you have a comment, suggestions or general objection, feel free to let me know.

Update 2 -- https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fruitsfruits are no more.

I agree it's pretty random, but as an identification question I don't see what's too localized about it. Identifying an anime based on a screenshot is something we're allowing. I don't see how this is any more localized than other identification request questions based on http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4818/what-questions-should-be-closed-with-reason-too-localized. It's demonstrably within our community's ability to answer it and the answer was interesting enough to garner several upvotes (though that could also be due to [tag:fruit])b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, it's a pretty strange question, and it's fine if people downvote it for that reason, but I think closing it sets a bad precedent against some types of identification questions which in my view should still be allowed. If I wanted to identify an anime, but all I had was background art, would that be allowed? Or what if I wanted to [identify an anime based on a minor side-story](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2379/title-of-an-anime-with-this-certain-side-story)? Anyway it's not so important since that question isn't likely to have any more activity, but IMO it should be open.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Alright, I'll repeal the argument in light of your objections.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM: I think the identification request should show something that is not too generic. In the case of that question, we only see a bunch of fruits, which I think is not a reasonable amount of information for the answerer to work on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh It seems a bit strange to me that you're claiming there is not a reasonable amount of information to work on when the question was answered within an hour of being posted. Also, I don't think displaying a lot of different fruits together in an anime is actually very generic. I can't think of any other anime with similar scenes. I will admit it's a pretty minor detail about the show, but I'm not sure why that's a problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM: `it's a pretty minor detail about the show, but I'm not sure why that's a problem.` The fact that it is not characteristic of the actual show makes it looks more of [challenge to find out how *into* the show one is]. Maybe I'd tolerate one or two such question, but I wouldn't want to see a bunch of identification with such minor clue provided.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I can agree with that. It would be a bit of a problem if we got lots of questions like this. However, there haven't been many such questions, and unless we reach a point that they actually become a problem I think it's better not to make any rules regarding this. For now, I think comments and (in some cases) downvotes are sufficient if you aren't satisfied with the level of detail provided in the post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Love "Closure, for the sake of @ShotgunNinja".


















Of the seven posts listed as going to be "closed or deleted", I'm in favor of eventually deleting all of them as they are right now. The reputation will only affect a couple of people significantly, and there's  no helping that. Those people could probably gain that reputation back in a few days, and if they can't we should be questioning whether they really deserve it in the first place. More importantly, if we kept those questions closed but not deleted, and they stay highly upvoted, it would send a strange signal to new users as to what's acceptable and what the standards of this community are.

Closed questions aren't intended to stay in that state forever. They're supposed to either get deleted or get modified and reopened. None of those seem to be easily modifiable to be valid questions. If the OPs think they can make them into serious constructive and on-topic questions, then they can request some time to do so. However, closure shouldn't be our long-term strategy for dealing with garbage.

Of course, they have some historical relevance, but I don't think they qualify for a historical lock. A historical lock is supposed to indicate high-quality content that isn't technically allowed, but these are low quality posts. In my opinion the best thing to do is to make a meta post with links to all of the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fruitsfruits questions, both deleted and still alive. That way established users can still find them, but they don't send a bad message to new users.

Deleted posts with +3 and deleted after 60 days keep their rep.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial I don't think we should be that concerned with the rep. I'm more concerned with people stumbling upon our site in the next few days and seeing a ton of closed questions.


















As many of you may (or may not) know, shortly before April Fools' day, we decided that fruit was fantastic and that we should spend the day asking as many fruit-related questions as possible, with loosened bounds on what was, and was not, allowed.

The result is 24 questions (rivaling, at the time, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/one-pieceone-piece and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production) about various fruits stemming from our commitment to being festive around the holidays. Some were not constructive and have been deleted, others are perfectly valid, and some even have answers!

The links have been archived here for onlookers and other such interested parties.

Meta is mostly an information and discussion site about the main site, so its rules differ slightly. It is a bit misleading that the software still labels them as such, but [not all posts on meta](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/7931/192960) have answers.


















In my opinion we do not need all three tags.

There is very little in common between Higurashi and Umineko. The characters are almost entirely different, and the plots are basically unrelated. Almost all the in-universe questions that make sense to ask are specific to one or the other. Plenty of people (including to some degree myself) are an expert on one but not the other. Wikipedia doesn't even have a real entry for the series; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_They_Crywhat they have is a disambiguation page pointing to Higurashi and Umineko. Hence, we should probably have different tags for the two.

As for whether we need a third tag for the series as a whole, this seems unnecessary right now. It's not prohibitive to just use tags for both Higurashi and Umineko for the few questions about the series as a whole. More importantly, this tag risks being used on questions which are specific to one or the other, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/181/what-exactly-are-the-rollbacks-in-higurashiWhat exactly are the rollbacks in Higurashi?. If that happens, this tag will be the most used, which will be bad for SEO since "Higurashi" and "Umineko" are likely to be the most common search terms. If the franchise expands significantly it might eventually be necessary, but for now such a tag is counterproductive and harmful to SEO.

As for what tags to use, all things being equal we should prefer the English language version of the names. The most common search terms are just "Higurashi" and "Umineko" which will be caught by either the English or Japanese titles. Hence we should use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/higurashi-when-they-cryhigurashi-when-they-cry and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/umineko-when-they-cryumineko-when-they-cry. Synonyms should be made for the Japanese names https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/higurashi-no-naku-koro-nihigurashi-no-naku-koro-ni and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/umineko-no-naku-koro-niumineko-no-naku-koro-ni.

tl;dr:


Add https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/higurashi-when-they-cryhigurashi-when-they-cry with synonym https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/higurashi-no-naku-koro-nihigurashi-no-naku-koro-ni.

Keep all three tags.


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/higurashi-no-naku-koro-nihigurashi-no-naku-koro-ni is specific to Higurashi (WTC1-2)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/umineko-no-naku-koro-niumineko-no-naku-koro-ni is specific to Umineko (WTC3-4)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/when-they-crywhen-they-cry is for overlapping parts of the franchise


The Umineko sound novels provide some further insight into the workings of some parts of Higurashi, and therefore https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/181/what-exactly-are-the-rollbacks-in-higurashiWhat exactly are the rollbacks in Higurashi? probably could not be explained fully without knowledge gained from Umineko, despite it being a question about Higurashi. This is why it is tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/when-they-crywhen-they-cry - this is a question about overlapping parts of the franchise.

If they are so unrelated as Logan M's answer claims, then why has the creator given them not only similar Japanese titles but also series-like English titles?

Not sure if this is worth nothing, but it is rumored that WTC5 is in the works to some degree already.

Tags are supposed to be attributes of the question, not the answer(s).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the titling, I don't know why they are so similar, but IMO that's stylistic and not incredibly substantial. I also don't know why the "Final Fantasy" games are all titled similarly despite being mostly unrelated plotwise. The English titles are translated from the Japanese ones so the fact that both are similar doesn't really have any extra meaning. However, if the they are so closely related (which, having read all of the kinetic novels, I disagree with), we should have one tag, not two. Three is redundant no matter how you slice it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM It seems like almost all of our identification requests are tagged with the answer though - http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, that's something which should probably stop. It was discussed at http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/435/should-we-add-a-series-tag-to-identification-questions-that-have-accepted-answer. Unfortunately a lot of people are still doing it, and in my opinion it's not really worth it to revert those edits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This aged well in [2022 with gou sotsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD0PuYzJm88) and [ciconia](https://www.reddit.com/r/umineko/comments/tfg4kq/ryukishi07_stated_that_her_similarity_to_was/)!


















When a user wants to ask about an specific anime they are usually creating new tags adding no info to them. For example:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3062/what-exactly-is-paradiseWhat exactly is “Paradise”? https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wolfs-rainwolfs-rain

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3068/did-all-the-townsfolk-know-that-yuki-is-a-wolfDid all the townsfolk know that Yuki is a wolf? https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wolfs-childrenwolfs-children

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3286/what-part-of-tiger-bunny-do-purple-white-and-green-plastic-bins-refer-toWhat part of Tiger & Bunny do purple, white, and green plastic bins refer to? https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tiger-and-bunnytiger-and-bunny

What should we do with these tags? Should we start to add info to every tag added?

Yes

As this Tags get description or new tags are added i will update the list.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should we do about new series tag wikis?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you want people to start going through and deleting in the post after they edit the tag wikis?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well I was going to add the wiki info this weekend but if someone else is willing to help great...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I've been starting to add to wikis on the list. I can just delete the ones that I do as I go.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course do it ;).


















Yes.

IMO, if the tag is proper (i.e. not an odd meta-tag or a series that doesn't exist/is unrelated), then it should have a tag wiki entry. This is the case especially for new or less popular tags, when we want them to be visible and entice people to use them.

I really don't see any reason to not add the tag wikis. If they aren't helpful or need to be removed, we will either decline the edit or have someone remove the entry.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. It's worth noting that the most important cases to write tag wikis are if the series is likely to be asked about again and/or the tag is somehow ambiguous. [tag:girls-und-panzer] is probably not so important to get a wiki, since it's obvious what it refers to and it's not a hugely popular series. On the other hand, if you use abbreviations or the series is known by multiple names, a tag wiki is important.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, [this meta question](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/385/how-do-i-write-a-good-tag-wiki) addresses the question of how to write a good tag wiki. Note that it isn't acceptable to just copy from some other source. That constitutes plagarism and your edit will be rejected if we notice this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, that's kinda how tags work. They are born out of need, and upgraded when possible (with wikis and excerpts).


















would it not make more sense to 'close' the question rather than delete it outright? Suppose it's determined that the question is unanswerable - that's information for someone who's googling the same question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, in principle. However, the asker can't close a question unilaterally. They can, however, delete it so long as it doesn't have any upvoted answers. The benefit of doing this for the site is that it's one fewer unanswered question, which helps our statistics and looks better overall. However, if the asker is certain that the question is unanswerable, and has evidence to prove that, the best thing to do is to leave a self-answer explaining that. It's perfectly fine to answer your own questions, even if it's just to say that there's no real answer based on canonical sources.


















In general, my preference would be for the following system. In descending order of preference, we should generally:


Use English name. If there is an official English name which fits in 35 characters, we should go with that. Subtitles can be omitted in general.
Use English abbreviation. If the English title exists, but it does not fit in 35 characters, and there is an official abbreviation of the English title which does fit, then use that.
Use romanized Japanese title. Hepburn romanization is the standard method most of us use. Since macrons are not available without going to unicode characters (which is a bad idea) be sure to do these in the traditional style, e.g. ō should be replaced with ou. In Japanese word boundaries are sometimes ambiguous, but usually it's fairly clear where they should be.
Use Japanese abbreviated title. This is going to be common for shows with long titles, like Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai gets tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/oreimooreimo. There are usually official abbreviations for series with very long titles, at least for those series that are fairly successful.
If none of the above seem to fit, come up with something that works temporarily, e.g. the first N words of the title. Make a meta post asking for suggestions for a better tag name.


We can't expect all cases to be handled by the above rules, and even when they are it may not give the best name. If the English name is official but very uncommon we might want to stick with the Japanese one. In these cases, it's best to make a meta post asking for suggestions. These will have to be treated on an individual basis.

Also, tag synonyms are very helpful. Having lots of synonyms hurts nothing so long as we aren't going to be needing that tag name for anything else (unlikely). Unfortunately tag synonyms are often hard to create for smaller tags, which is where they're more useful, so it's probably easier just to PM a mod in chat for obvious requests, or make a meta post requesting a synonym if there could be some ambiguity or there's a need to document and vote on the request. Eventually the tag synonym suggestions should work the same way they do on the larger sites, but right now we don't have the volume of posts in most tags for it to be feasible.

Finally, in all cases except the totally obvious ones, the tag wiki (not necessarily excerpt) should contain all of the titles by which a series is known, near the top. That will help to clear up some confusion. An image can also go a long way to confirming that the tag you're using is/isn't correct.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would prefer users to create a meta post about creating tag synonyms rather than pinging any of us in chat. It makes record and documentation easier, and helps the community follow which synonyms were made when.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"*If the English name is official but very uncommon we might want to stick with the Japanese one.*" This is my concern. When 2/3 of the Google results are for the Japanese name (on an English search), I feel like we should be using that instead. At the **very** least, as a synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric Perhaps, but it makes no sense to try to make a universal policy regarding these cases. They should be decided as they appear. The default should be the English name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha If there's any chance for ambiguity or need for permanent documentation of the synonyms, I think it should get a meta post. However, for the unambiguous cases, like [tag:zero-no-tsukaima] -> [tag:the-familiar-of-zero], it is typically easier and faster to PM a mod in my experience. Making a meta post is also perfectly acceptable, and if you as a mod think it's potentially ambiguous you should direct the user to do so. However, I don't see much benefit in having such a meta post for every series when most of them don't really require any formal documentation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM: That's kinda how everyone does it. Even though it's faster, having such posts under a [meta-tag:synonym-request] tag doesn't hurt.


















We've had a few questions about how otaku are seen in Japanese culture. https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2953/24Do otaku tend to be bullied? was closed fairly quickly. This question asks about how Japanese people see otaku. On the other hand, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3410/24Is the term Otaku derogatory? was asked recently, and doesn't seem to be in any immediate danger of being closed. It asks about what connotations are associated with the term.

In my view both of these questions are fairly similar in that they are mostly about otaku (either the term or the people, but in a broad cultural context) and not anime. Perhaps on that basis, both of them should be closed. That would also seem to affect https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2852/24What kinds of activities can be found in a Manga/Anime Club?, though, which is highly upvoted and favorited. I'm not sure that question is on-topic either, despite writing the only answer to it, but it doesn't seem like anyone wants it closed at the moment.

What sorts of questions about otaku should we allow within our scope?

I largely agree with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/users/51/veger@Veger's https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/525/274answer, but I'd like to sum up my thoughts in a succinct way:

If the question is constructive and pertains to culture specific to the anime/manga community, I think it should be allowed.

If you exclude us, currently, there is no StackExchange network site which handles anime culture. And, since I think it's fair to say that most anime fans will know anime culture at least decently well, I think that makes it somewhat fitting for the people on this site to be the ones answering those questions.

The only qualm I have about these questions is that I think many of the answers will tend to relate more to social and societal influences in Japan rather than about the anime-specific component of the question. But I think that's a detail that's left to be sorted out by those voting on the answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I assume when you're saying "there is no site which handles anime culture", you're specifically talking about SE sites. Otherwise that statement is false.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Yes, that is what I'm saying. I'll clarify that in the post.


















You should remember that this, first and foremost, is a Q&A site.

People come here to ask questions, not build a community. They don't mind if the tag is documented or not.

If they care, great, we'll welcome the help. But I don't want to force, or even hint to people that they can document their tags. There are more useful activities on the site that they can take place in (Like asking, answering, flagging, suggesting edits).

We want to have the involved in the community first, if they want to join. When they do, we can introduce tag editing to them.

In short, I, a visitor from Google came here to ask a question. Not to document tags or help this community, I want my question answered, this site's job is to provide with the answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough, keep in mind that a visitor from google wouldn't be able to create tags (*new user*). :) I'm talking about the ones who 'settle' down, join from other se sites etc.. I might have weighed on the new user a bit too much but what I could have said or rather meant was as you said In your second to last paragraph, once they have become involved enough don't just create the tags and leave them empty.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I, a visitor from Google, might happen to have a 40K account on [so]. Users who are active on other sites usually are aware of the ability to edit tag wiki and excerpts. I see where you're coming from, but it's not something we can ask a user to do, it needs to come from himself :)


















Recently, we had a main-site post, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3520/who-was-the-first-trap-characterWho was the first "trap" character.

This post generated a lot of controversy for the use of the term "trap" to describe cross-dressing characters, amassing 3 upvotes, 3 downvotes, at least one offensive flag, and one favorite in under an hour. In general, "trap" refers to a male character (in the biological sense; the character's gender identity and sexual orientation are not usually implied by the term) who is mistaken (deliberately or accidentally) for a female (for instance, based on their choice of clothing). The term "reverse trap" is often applied to the reverse situation of a female dressing like a male, though sometimes "trap" is used for both cases.

This term was seen as offensive to some as a transgender slur (see, for instance, http://eshusplayground.tumblr.com/post/35273419707/trigger-warning-transmisogyny-anti-trans-slurthis tumblr post). However, the term is fairly standardized in the anime community (for instance, see http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trapsthis Know Your Meme article), and is not usually intended as a slur in this context. A https://www.google.com/search?q=traps+in+anime&rlz=1C1TSNO_enUS459US459&aq=f&oq=traps+in+anime&aqs=chrome.0.57j60j0l3j60.2295j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&gs_rn=11&gs_ri=psy-ab&gs_mss=anime%20traps&tok=7bLWM2FcxioxrPNa79jlFQ&pq=anime%20traps&cp=10&gs_id=45&xhr=t&q=anime+traps&es_nrs=true&pf=p&rlz=1C1TSNO_enUS459US459&sclient=psy-ab&oq=anime+trap&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&fp=a8294ff09a11e412&biw=1454&bih=665Google search for "Anime traps" gives millions of results, coming from many anime blogs, fora, and other sites, and none of these seem to be deliberately using the term in an offensive way.

What should we do in this case? Should we treat the term as offensive and use a different term for the same concept? Or should we allow use of the term despite it's potential to offend some people? Also, how should we deal with similar cases in the future?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow use of the term "trap" and other potentially offensive but common terminology?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One important point to note here is that it seems the vast majority of the Anime community isn't even *aware* that the word is offensive in ***any*** context. And today we have learned the hard way that this is indeed not the case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just want to add my own thoughts to your definition: What I've gathered from anime communities over time is that a trap is not necessarily a crossdressing character (though they could be), but a male (biologically) character who is mistaken for a female. This can happen without crossdressing - it would not be odd for a male or a female to wear a shirt and jeans, but for whatever reason (looks, voice, etc.) the trap character is mistaken for a girl even while wearing such gender-neutral clothes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza That's a good point. I've edited my post to match that better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well, to be perfectly clear, I was one of the people who downvoted it, but  I did not do so because I was offended by the subject matter.  I did so because it was a "what was the first..." kind of question, and I'd consider such quetions to be not-constructive


















This is a very difficult issue, and one I had not expected; I didn't even know the word was controversial.
That said, this is not something easy to sort out; even if we determine a policy that such words are allowed, some users will still inevitably find them offensive and vote down a question as a result, or flag the post. It is difficult to communicate to these users that the terms are allowed due to their commonness and the fact that they are not used in a derogatory manner.
However, I think it is in the best interests of the site to allow questions containing words which some users may find offensive, but which are common terms in the anime community.
We have already decided that things such as ecchi are allowed (in moderation) and we know that any user must legally be 13 years of age or older. This means we should trust them to be mature about sensitive issues. Not only that, but most people here are familiar with anime and should understand the context the word is in. If a user takes issue with such a post, they are free to comment, start a meta, or come to chat to discuss it with a moderator.
(Keep in mind that moderators can super-ping users to chat so that they can carry on a discussion about the issue. This, of course, means that any OP should be able to back up why he has chosen such a word—did he hear it once and not know it was offensive (in which case it should be changed), or is it actually a common word which is not meant to be offensive?)
TL;DR
We need to tread carefully here, but the fact is that some common terms (trap appears to be a good example) can also be taken offensively. The terms which we choose to allow may need to be taken on a case-by-case basis, but in general I think it's best to allow them if they are common in non-offensive usage.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It might also helpful to to properly explain these terminology as you post them, for newer users who might not be well vered in the lexicon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anything can offend anyone. If you offended someone with your post, edit it to make it clear that wasn't the intention. If you find something you find as abusive, flag it, ideally with a custom flag, and explain exactly why do you find it abusive.


















It seems like the strong consensus in this case is to continue using the term "trap" but treat similar future cases on an individual basis. This is a decision that I agree with (I agree with both of the posted answers), but I'd like to focus on why, in my opinion, "trap" is acceptable to use on this site (with apologies to anyone offended by the term). In my opinion these are good criteria to look at in future cases, should any arise.


The origin of the term is not offensive. The origin is (as far as I can tell) on 4chan's /a/ board exclusively to describe anime characters, many of whom are not transgender (the group at which the slur is aimed). Please correct me on this if I am mistaken. However, assuming this is correct, anyone using the term as a slur is arguably misusing the term. Admittedly, 4chan isn't really a great place to be getting our terminology from, but it seems to have stuck in this case.
The intended meaning was not offensive. In this case, the intended meaning exactly matches the original meaning. The term is not being applied to any real-life people, and certainly not as a slur. If it were used in such a way, that would constitute offensive language. Even the tumblr post linked above only claims the term is, as far as I can tell, only complaining about its use to describe actual transgender people, not fictional characters.
There is no equivalent less-offensive term to describe the same thing. All of the alternatives are either not sufficient or too wordy to be useful in practice. "Male character who is often mistaken for a female" is wordy and hard to follow when used in complex sentences, and also doesn't demonstrate that the trope exists. "Trap" is concise, searchable, and the mere existence of the term is sufficient to demonstrate how common it is as a character trait. 
The way the term is being used is its most common usage. This needs to be qualified a bit. Given that we are a site about anime, we should consider the use of the term among the anime community. Our user base isn't totally representative of the broader anime community, but it's fairly close. Most, if not all, of our high-rep users were aware of the meaning of "trap" to describe anime characters, and as far as I can tell none of us were aware that it was used outside that context, let alone as a slur. Furthermore, other anime sites regularly use the term very often, and I've never seen it claimed on any such site that the term is offensive. I do not know about the broader rates of usage of "trap", but the slur meaning must not be terribly common among the general public either if none of us were aware of it. As such, it is not likely to be confused for a slur when used on this site.


With all that said, it is worth noting that the objections to the term are not minor either. Any term used as a slur against a group of people should be used with caution. If you intend to use it, it's probably worth pointing out in your post that it is not intended to be offensive. However, we can't be expected to conform to every possible standard of inoffensiveness either, as anyone can find anything offensive. Furthermore, it wouldn't really solve anything, since a lot of the material in anime is itself considered offensive by some people. It's hard to imagine that, for instance, Maria Holic, Detroit Metal City, or Kodomo no Jikan would be considered inoffensive by anyone offended by "trap".

So, again with apologies to anyone offended by the term, it seems like we're going to continue using "trap" to describe such characters barring opinions drastically shifting, any of the above points changing, or some higher power telling us not to do so.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The term "trap" is offensive because it refers to a situation where a straight person is seduced by or attracted to a transgender person, then alarmed or disgusted when they discover that person's true nature. It's the same kind of thing as using "gay" as an insult, it implies that finding a transgender person attractive or having feelings for them is somehow bad.

Flavors: "Swimming" and/or "Beaches"
Description: Anything related to girls and guys swimming (indoors or outdoors), or participating in beach sports or events (like beach volleyball, suntanning, etc.).

We've been promoting an event that takes place every Saturday: "Flavor Day".
In each Flavor Day, one or two flavors are picked and questions about them are encouraged (for further info and suggestions for flavors you'd like to see featured, see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/537/what-flavors-would-you-like-to-see-for-our-weekly-flavor-daysthis post).

This post's purpose is to keep track of the questions asked each week under each "flavor".
Each answer left here will correspond to a Flavor Day, meaning there will be one answer per week.

Use this template for each week:


  Flavor Day #
  Flavor(s): "Flavor 1" and/or "flavor 2"
  Date: Date of the flavor in question

So far me, Krazer, LoganM and Eric have been deciding it, but very few people other than us have been participating in the discussion.


















Questions on anime physics are, in my opinion, fine. For instance, asking how in-universe mechanics work can generate some perfectly valid questions. It's typically impossible to tell a priori whether a question like this will be answerable with in-universe information, or if the only possible answers will be speculative. I occasionally see questions like this on https://scifi.stackexchange.com/Scifi, which we tend to use as a role-model site, and they can generate good answers. (They can also  generate low-quality speculative answers, but those typically get downvoted and replaced by better answers.)

However, I don't see much use for the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics. I'm not sure who benefits from it. My feeling is that the users who will understand these sorts of things best are the users who are especially familiar with the series; there are no experts in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics as far as I can tell. I also don't see it being terribly useful for searching or for classification purposes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think anime physics remain the same between canons, so I don't think there *can* be an [anime-physics] expert. So I agree: Kill the tag, keep the concept.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric While there are certain aspects of anime physics which are common among different canons (see e.g. http://www.cs.utah.edu/~duongsaa/more_htm/jk_100animeRules.htm), in my opinion those are already covered by [tag:tropes].


















This flavor was chosen for May 11, 2013
Flavor: Music (including OP and ED sequences)
Description: Anything related to anime about music, or music in anime (such as theme songs).
Almost all anime have theme songs, and most have a lot more music in their OSTs than just that. As such, it's something that fans of many different genres can ask about. Also, shows about music, like Nodame Cantabile and Beck, don't seem to be getting many questions, so this could potentially help generate a few.

They tend to have some interesting and hidden things related the show's story.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1306322 That was my original intent. I'll edit it to be clearer though.


















We should request for the script to be disabled.

This will prevent lots of correct tags from being deleted, but we'll need to actively police our tag list to make sure that invalid tags don't catch on and delete new ones which are clearly bad tags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I cast my own vote for this one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It'll be hard to keep track of all the ones that are deleted, this was is probably less effort for all involved


















We should keep the script enabled.

This will delete some bad tags after 6 months of disuse, but we'll need to regularly re-edit the good tags (including series tags) back on to questions which become untagged.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the script should be enabled, we can challenge users to make new questions for tags they want to be kept, like how [Biblical Hermeneutics](http://meta.hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/400/lets-save-our-tags) and [Board and Card Games](http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/942/lets-save-our-tags) currently do. It might help generate more questions for the site as well, and maybe also weed out niche topics.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer: How should we tag the questions about one-shot stories? Or do we want those at all?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I don't see why we can't have those. Just tagging it with the name is fine, but if a one-shot shares the name of another story/series, we can try tagging it with the author name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer One-shot series tend to have fewer question - and in the case it is only used once, it will trigger the tag deletion script.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh we can try tagging one-shots with the author names then, but if we do this we have to make sure the title of the work is in the title.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer: Why not challenge users to make new questions for tags they want to be kept even with the script disabled? It may not always work out with having people to ask multiple questions about a subject.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha I don't see why not, but I feel that there might be more motivation when the threat of elimination looms over them. Use it... or lose it!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer One of the first tags likely to get deleted is [tag:spirited-away]. I don't have any other questions about it, and I don't see any reason why the tag should go (leaving the question untagged), so I'll just edit it back on after it gets deleted. I suspect cases like this will be far more common than cases of neglected series that will suddenly get more questions to keep the tag alive.


















Flavors: "Pets" or [specific type of pet]

Description: We did cats why not do other pets or familiars?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Because cats are clearly superior!


















Flavors: Winter and/or Christmas

Description: Many anime have winter themed episodes, and Christmas specials are also not uncommon. Related things, like snow, winter sports, etc. are also welcome. 

http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?p=3403490#post3403490This forum post has a list of about 100 anime with Christmas themed episodes from over 2 years ago. I don't have a more complete list, but it should at least convince you that this is very common in anime and hopefully give you ideas for questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why not include holidays in general? New year episode are usually pretty big in animus, too? Not to mention Valentine's and White Day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer Expanding to all holidays feels too disjoint to me, and I think having a topic that is too broad actually makes it harder to come up with questions. Valentines day and New years could also be nominated separately, but IMO it's better if we don't combine all of them into one.


















First: I agree with Logan's answer quite a lot. He addresses lots of things that are crucial points of weakness in our site.

That aside, I think we're losing a type of question that we once had many questions from, and there is a gold mine of questions that we can draw from that type. The type is "specific questions about events or characters in a single anime".

I say this because of a comparison I did between https://scifi.stackexchange.com/SciFi's homepage and https://anime.stackexchange.com/our own. (If you want to see some SciFi examples of this category: https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/35677/13099(1) https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/1609/13099(2) https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/35017/13099(3) https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/34439/13099(4))

This type of question composes around half of our most upvoted* questions:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/836/274Do people in the anime or manga actually eat Pokemon?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/1/274The treasure in One Piece is at the end of the grand line. But isn't that the same as the beginning?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2551/274Why is Edward Newgate called Whitebeard?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/664/274What happens when Naruto is talking to the Kyuubi?


It seems, though, like these types of questions are seen little anymore. Of the 48 questions on SciFi's homepage, 28 are story-specific questions (not including closed ones, even). We barely have half that many; we have many more about things such as identification requests, or involving multiple anime, or are about anime itself. These questions are great, and are on-topic, but are not likely to draw a lot of answers or intrigue from people who find or participate in our site.

So, here's my suggestion:


Encourage users to ask (and possibly seed?) questions that pertain to the specifics of anime that they frequent, whether this be Naruto, Bleach, Poyopoyo Kansatsu Nikki, or whatever.
Do not discourage other questions from being asked, of course. As I said above, they are valid and on-topic. We just want to encourage other questions, too.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I agree that we should get more in-universe questions like these. They tend to be more easily answerable (for those who have seen the series), less subjective, and more often searched for. The trouble is that general questions are easier for everyone to participate in, so they tend to generate lots of upvotes and views compared to in-universe questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With that in mind, I'd go a bit further and say that general questions like "What is the meaning of X in anime?" or "Does X occur in anime?" should be *somewhat discouraged* except in the case that they are actually useful to someone or commonly searched for. That isn't a call to pile on downvotes, but I think overall as a community we could use a bit more downvoting of general questions which aren't particularly useful (preferably with some sort of comments).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Yes, I agree with both comments. I know that some questions are hard to get upvotes for, but let's face it: that's not the most important thing here. Getting solid content that will bring users--even one user--is important. As per your second comment, I think the first one you brought up is a borderline case; often it does mean something, and sometimes something very important. The second question you posed will almost always be NC so I think that discouragement speaks for itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is that the votes *are* important. They indicate what our community considers valuable content, and serve as positive reinforcement for the existing behavior for our current users. When identification and general questions and answers are getting lots of upvotes, there's little incentive for users to post in-universe questions, even high quality ones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the example questions, I don't have a problem with *useful* questions. The first one sometimes falls into that category, but I feel like a lot of the questions of the form "What does X mean in anime?" are about things which occur very generally in lots of types of fiction, not just anime. As for the second question, we could come up with lots of similar questions which have not yet been closed as NC, such as [this recent one](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3760/24) (not that I have a particular problem with this question individually; the problem is the volume of similar questions).


















On the main site right now, this site's traffic is reported as 0 visitors per day:



This was reproduced by one other person in the main Anime & Manga chatroom. Area51 currently shows us with 741 visits, which is a lot more than 0:



This is likely to go away on it's own given enough time, but I'm submitting the bug report anyway in case it indicates a more serious issue with the visit counting.



Update: As of 7:53 UTC, this is now showing 723, which is a more reasonable number (and which agrees with what Area51 had yesterday). As long as it doesn't happen again I guess it can be safely ignored.

Regardless it does seem to be fixed now. Good spotting, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess this is a good place to mention for posterity that this phenomenon seems to occur occasionally, probably because some internal lookup failed or something. I've seen it 2 or 3 more times in the past year. It is typically fixed within a couple of hours. So for any future bug reports related to this statistic, first wait to see if the situation corrects itself.


















I think all three of the previous answers are good advice. However, thinking that just following those good practices will solve the problem without making any other changes to how we do things around here seems too idealistic to me. All three of the existing answers are things that we should be doing, and to some degree we are doing them, but our statistics have not improved. This suggests that more drastic actions may be warranted.



I decided to look at what kinds of questions are getting answered, and how well they are getting answered. For this, I divided up the questions on our site into 3 categories. These are the following:


General Questions: Questions not about any particular series, but about anime in general. ID requests for a particular series are included here also. The reasoning behind this is that answering such a question typically doesn't require expert-level knowledge of a particular series, but rather broad knowledge of a lot of series.
Popular Series: Series with 10+ questions as of writing this. Specifically, these are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Fullmetal Alchemist, Pokemon, Fairy Tail, and Death Note. This was a convenient place to cut off, because above this point are mostly series that are popular enough that casual anime fans are likely to have watched them, while below are mostly less common series. There are some exceptions (Cowboy Bebop and Neon Genesis Evangelion come to mind) but most series with fewer than 10 questions are not as popular as those above.
Other Series: Questions about any series other than those listed above.


Here are some statistics. I compiled these at roughly 2:00 UTC today, March 19th. There are 118 unanswered questions. Out of the current unanswered questions, here's how they're divided up.

General Questions: 5 unanswered (4.2% of all unanswered)

Popular Series: 7 unanswered (5.9% of all unanswered)

Other Series: 106 unanswered (89.8% of all unanswered)

Most of our unanswered questions are about particular series which tend to be less popular. Let's go one step further, and figure out how many total questions there are in each category. There are currently 919 total questions. The following statistics are my best estimates, but I may have miscounted a few questions, though this shouldn't change the numbers much.

General Questions: 133 total (14.5% of all questions, 96.2% answered and/or closed)

Popular Series: 309 total (33.6% of all questions, 97.7% answered and/or closed)

Other Series: 477 total (51.9% of all questions, 77.8% answered and/or closed)

It shouldn't be surprising that we do better on popular series and general questions than on less popular ones, but the degree to which this is true was surprising to me. It also seems to be true that the first two categories tend to have more answers per question. That is to say, with mainstream series and general questions, we're doing pretty well, but with less popular series we are having a lot of difficulty.



This suggests to me that the reason our answer stats are low is because we have a lot of questions on this site for which there aren't any experts on the series. To put it differently, the long tail on this site is particularly long, compared to what we are prepared to answer. There are thus 3 things which we can do:


Get more experts: This would be the ideal solution, but I do not know of any way to accomplish it, except waiting and promoting our site. We've tried various things, but they don't seem to be working particularly quickly.
Ask more questions in categories 1 and 2 and fewer in category 3: These will dilute the questions in category 3 in our statistics. However, to do so effectively, we'd need roughly 63% of our questions to be of those categories 1 and 2 to reach 90% answered, and 78% to reach 93%. Even if we got no new questions in category 3, those would require roughly 370 and 1250 questions of category 1 or 2, respectively. These do not seem like feasible numbers in the near future. Closing some particularly bad questions in category 3 will help some, but I don't think this is likely to solve the issue.
Become experts in these series ourselves: To some degree, some users have already been doing this by doing extensive research on these questions, but this isn't really consistent with the Stack Exchange philosophy for Q&A.


None of these are good solutions, but they are the best options that I can think of. There are other options, which are even worse, such as restricting our scope to only popular series or providing and upvoting low quality useless answers, but at this point I think we would be actively harming the site for the sake of statistics, which is an incredibly moronic thing to do.

With that in mind, I personally will not be asking any more questions from category 3 unless I'm certain they will get answered, and I'd urge other users who are asking questions mostly for the purpose of seeding to do the same. This may hurt our questions per day statistic, but we're doing fine in that department in my opinion. We're around the median for questions per day, while we're way below the median in terms of answer stats. Also, we're near the bottom in terms of our total number of users. I suspect that our small user base is simply overwhelmed with 5+ questions per day, and by temporarily decreasing this number substantially we could improve the other stats.

Also, I am in no small part to blame for the problem, since I have 19 unanswered questions myself out of 72 total (only 73.6% answered). Some of those are questions for which I know the answer to; I'll answer them myself or give the answer to some other user. Others are probably answerable, but maybe too difficult or too niche. I'll gradually be going through these and either editing them to be easier or deleting them entirely. I may undelete them at some point in the future if we get more users with broader interests. I don't particularly want to delete these questions, since they provide lots of good things for new users with broad interests to answer, but for the moment it makes more sense to focus on more mainstream series.

As a note, I hope that having more questions about Naruto, Bleach, etc. will not be a turn-off to future experts. There is a difficulty in anime that many people who have very broad interests are not particularly interested in mainstream series. However, I think that we can simultaneously please the experts and keep our content more mainstream than it is right now as long as we focus on things which are still popular, but not extremely popular. That is to say, we should be looking through lists of popular anime (such as http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?type=bypopularityMAL's list) and targetting the top 100-or-so series, as well as currently airing popular seires. These are things that still have lots of fans, and consequently lots of experts, but are diverse enough to have things that interest all types of fans.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel like there's no easy way to find questions about more obscure series. I bet there'd be questions of that type I could answer, but without going down a list of every anime I'm familiar with, I don't have a good way of finding them. I found out about this site too late to say "hey I think something like genre tags should be consistently used", but otherwise questions I might be interested in are drowned out by Naruto/Bleach, etc.


















I agree with a lot of what Eric said. Looking around the front page every day, I've been finding fewer and fewer questions about shows that I watch such as Naruto and Bleach. I feel like part of the reason for this is that there has been some amount of push to have a more diverse question base. The problem with this is that this leaves people who don't read/watch the series that the more eclectic questions are being asked about with nothing to answer.

I think trying to go back to having more questions about shows like Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, and other very popular shows might be a good idea. That doesn't mean that people have to only ask about those shows, but anyone who looks at are site who only watches the popular shows will likely not stay if none of those series show up on the first page or so.

One area where I feel we are generally lacking (and this may contradict slightly with the previous part of my answer) is in series that aren't shonen. Most of the series asked about are shonen, with a little seinen and even less shoujo or josei.  I don't know how to fix this, because presumably most of the people on the site watch and read mostly shonen, but I feel like anyone who reads/watches primarily shoujo won't want to join the site because they won't have anything to answer and won't feel like they'll have answerers for their questions.

Here's my thoughts on the questions.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3418/24What is the “foreign” language that is used in Suisei no Gargantia? - Excellent

This question only has one answer, but it is well-written. The page shows up near the top of a search for "Suisei no Gargantia language" which was already a common enough search term for Google to autocomplete to it. The pages above it don't have anywhere near the same level of detail. The answer is also not just copied from an external source, though it includes several external sources for further verification.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3244/24Why did Kabuto heal Hinata? - Satisfactory

This seems to be a common question, as I found multiple other sites with essentially the same question. We don't come up particularly high on a search for the question title, though we're still on the first page and the question has a good number of hits. The answer here is higher quality than the other sites in my opinion, but it still comes down to speculation to some degree. This sort of question could probably get multiple answers with different perspectives, but it only has one. All together, this could definitely be improved on, but it doesn't have any serious problems.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2988/24Why does Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle use the same characters as Card Captor Sakura? - Satisfactory

The answers on this question are correct and well-written, but the question is almost entirely unsearchable as-is. Because of this, I almost marked the question as 'Needs Improvement'. The title is too specific and won't bring in any search traffic. The question didn't come up in any of the searches I performed. Longer titles need to match search criteria more closely to come up highly in results, and this isn't matching anyone's searches. A better title would be something to the effect of "What is the connection between Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle and Card Captor Sakura?" though it would likely require rewording the existing question and answers slightly.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3328/24How can the man in the back see? - Satisfactory

This question has a lot of room for improvement. It's not going to bring in any search traffic as it is right now. The answer isn't really an answer either; it's just a note that the same character appears elsewhere. A complete answer would be an improvement. Despite these issues, I still rated the question as satisfactory, simply because I don't see any way to improve it as it is right now. The title isn't going to be searchable unless we can find the character's name. As for the answer, this is quite possibly a case where no satisfactory answer exists. Rating this as "Needs Work" would entail that I have suggestions for how to improve it, which I do not.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3130/24What is the origin of the face fault? - Needs Improvement

This is a good question, and we come up highly in the search results, and has a lot of traffic, but there's only one answer, which I don't consider satisfactory. It's essentially just a quote of a single other source, and one which comes before us in a search for "face fault origin" at that. Unfortunately, despite a bounty, this question failed to attract any higher quality answers, but it could desperately use some. As a note, this trope is not exclusive to anime, though it is particularly common in anime, so it's a bit questionable whether it really belongs on this site in my opinion.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3040/24What are the types of jutsus that exist in Naruto? - Satisfactory

This is a list question, and the list is rather long, but I think it's okay. We're nowhere near the top of a search for "Naruto types of jutsu" which was a Google autocomplete result. The content here is good, and of interest to a lot of people, but the question only has 75 views. The top answer starting with a disclaimer isn't really great either. However, the content here is pretty good; it's just already been listed elsewhere on higher traffic sites which are more natural places for it. With that in mind, I don't know how we could improve these, apart from deleting the disclaimer note.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3317/24What is the significance of anime characters' catch phrases? - Satisfactory

The answer here is high quality. Unfortunately, we aren't getting any traffic from the question. "Anime catchphrases" as a search already has lots of other high-quality sites, and we aren't anywhere near the top. I don't see us getting to the top of that search, at least not unless someone feels like writing a far-more in depth answer. That probably isn't worth it.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3296/24Why does cutting out part of Orochimaru’s soul cause him to lose the use of his arms? - Satisfactory

This doesn't seem to get much traffic either, and it's hard to search for. A better title might help that. It would also help a lot for a question like this to have images, at least in the answers, so that it's clear to someone like me (who doesn't know much about Naruto) what people are talking about. In my opinion, trying to get this question to bring in lots of traffic is futile, and the answers are good enough as is right now, though there is certainly room for improvement.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3334/24What did the old man say to the bartender at the end? - Excellent

Despite a bit of a questionable title, we're at the top of a search for "Death Billiards ending". The question has only 128 views, but Death Billiards is a single 25-minute movie, so it's not going to be a huge traffic magnet no matter what. The answer is thorough, though there's still a bit more room for other people to add their own speculation.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3306/24'Satisfaction Guaranteed' - was anything past volume 7 ever released in English? - Satisfactory (I accidentally clicked Excellent in review queue)

We come up highly in searches for both "Satisfaction Guaranteed English" (1st relevant result) and "Satisfaction Guaranteed English release" (1st result overall). The answer is also complete and well-written. The only problem is that Satisfaction Guaranteed is a rather niche series. The question only has 42 hits. I have no doubt that people who want to find this information are finding it through us, but there just aren't many people in that category in the first place.



Overall thoughts:


We could use more answers per question in almost all cases.
Titles matter a lot in terms of SEO. A few of the above posts could immediately be improved in terms of traffic if all we changed was the title.
Despite being very popular, Naruto questions tended to have average levels of traffic or lower. I suspect this is precisely because it's so popular. Most of the natural questions have already been asked and answered elsewhere, and we just aren't likely to beat those sites anytime soon in terms of search results.
The post on Death Billiards was the 4th highest trafficked of all of the review queue posts, despite being about a fairly niche series. This indicates to me that we can get a lot of traffic through even fairly niche anime if we have high quality content. However, the Satisfaction Guaranteed post, despite also being pretty high quality, didn't generate nearly as many hits, so we need to be posting the same things that people are asking about with regards to these sorts of series.
In some cases, even when a post has obvious issues (e.g. hard to search for), there is no obvious way to fix them. Unfortunately, the best thing to do in these situations is probably just to ignore them and focus on improving the posts which can be improved easily.

Concerning the question: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3758/list-of-anime-with-correct-animation-of-the-characters-playing-musical-instrumenList of anime with correct animation of the characters playing musical instrument, also related to this meta post: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/470/do-we-still-like-questions-asking-for-lists-of-anime-manga-etc/Do we still like questions asking for lists of anime/manga/etc.?

This definitely falls into the out of universe list and it would seem to abide by the 4 criteria for a list question. The problem I think is how the "reasonably scoped" part is interpreted. In this meta post it seems that the scoping mainly applies to how many items end up on a list, and it should, since asking for all shows that feature a pet is probably a really long list. In the case of the question about characters playing music, the resulting list is probably not going to be incredibly long. So it appears to satisfy the scoping criteria.

I thought that it may have been brought up during the chat (I can't remember) but should the scoping also include the set of items, shows, manga, etc that the list is derived from? When the question asks for something resulting in a relatively small list (e.g. "List of anime that has a character that is wearing a pinky ring") but the list is derived from every anime ever made, the scope is likely going to exceed what any one person can reasonably participate in. This doesn't mean that someone can't answer such a question by posting a link to an already completed list, but if such a list hasn't been created, and assuming nobody has watched every anime ever made (or a satisfyingly large percentage of them) and remembered enough details to create a list, this is going to be answered by committee, and people are going to list the shows that they've seen that match the criteria.

An example of a smaller scoping of the set that the list is derived from: "How many Lupin III movies/specials didn't have Fujiko?". The resulting list is reasonably scoped, we're not going to get all that many, maybe a dozen?. But the set of anime that the list draws from also isn't every anime ever made (10k?, more?) but the list of Lupin movies, which is maybe 30 or 40.

Currently, the tags https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga are blacklisted. They were blacklisted because they are meta-tags. So it's not really a case of "they aren't used", but rather a case of "they can't be used".  

Regarding the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/visual-novelvisual-novel tag, I think they should not be allowed either, since they are as much of a meta-tag as the other two.  

Either that, or they should all be allowed. But I think blacklisting is the way to go.

For other sorts of general questions, I think they typically fall into one of the existing tags.


















As per my comment on https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4/What software is used for making anime? and on OP:


The question should be about real knowledge of Japanese production internals.
The question must have nothing to do with "may Adobe After Effects be good for" kind of speculation. Speculation is bad. Speculation is what makes these questions 'off-topic'.
The question should not be about software.
The question must be focused tightly on the knowledge of how Japanese actually make anime, not on how they might.
The question has no place on https://video.stackexchange.com/Video Production, nor on https://japanese.stackexchange.com/Japanese Language, and definitely not on https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/Graphic Design. Western artists and craftspeople don't work in Japan, and most of them probably have no clue how Japanese actually make anime. They are no experts in Japanese internals, and western internals are not interesting in anime production.
There is a real question hidden there about Japanese commons of anime production that could be very special and quite distinct from anything else. Personally, I very seldom read or watch western-style, but love manga and anime. It's for a reason: Japanese are so much more advanced in them. Just like their seiyuu are of much, much higher quality and thus the seiyuu training internals would be equally interesting as the anime production internals. 


Strictly throw away all speculation about any method or tool. Throw away all western stuff. Focus on actual Japanese production.

And then it is on-topic, and only on topic here.



Edit:

Questions like https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/420/How are visual novels written? [closed] would be very interesting and on-topic if they would ask how Japanese  actually create manga, anime and visual novels. 

The problem is that instead they ask how these things could be created. But that is not interesting and is off-topic, because it results in speculation and advice that doesn't explain how actual Japanese achieve their generally very high quality. It is true that any general western software, graphic design or AV expert could give speculative ideas about how "some kind of animation" could be made. They would make actual facts about western methods, but most of them could only give speculations about Japanese methods on other SE sites.

But if these questions are re-worded to focus only on actual Japanese production method knowledge, then it makes them a very interesting and on-topic question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is consistent with what we are actually doing, just not documented very well. Questions saying "I want to make anime/manga, tell me how" are closed as off-topic, but questions asking "How is this particular step in creating anime/manga done?" are allowed. We have [tag:anime-production] and [tag:manga-production] for such questions, though unfortunately those tags have become somewhat broader and now include questions about the production of a particular series as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM thank you for pointing that out! I would love to read about *actual jap.* production. I'm still afraid that many like me may see two meaning in this questions title: after all, it's perfectly logical that you want to know about *actual* **japanese** production *because you want to learn what it takes to learn to achieve it yourself*. And at the same time, this same motivation makes you *completely disinterested* in speculation - however, the question's title doesn't decide on this, and actually incorporates both cases. This makes the title a little dangerously ambiguous in my opinion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding that particular question, it's one of the first ones from private beta (as is this meta question), and the rules were not established at that time. It's probably easier to re-ask the question in a more focused way than to try to get it reopened at this point. Also, while we do allow questions on anime production, specific production methods aren't something we have many experts in, so technical questions are likely to go unanswered here. They might get migrated to Graphic Design or some other SE site if they don't seem particularly anime-specific.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@naxa We're having a chat session this Saturday (25th May) at 1800 UTC. We are going to talk about some other stuff first, but we should have enough time to debate this matter afterwards. We'd be happy to have you there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM yes I agree; but *anime-specific* production, I believe, has still the biggest chance *here*. It would make this site greater too! (I think it could make use of boost in users.) But I agree that there are few experts now. I have a hypothesis: *if* the site would *advocate* using *kana* for specific questions (boot with Qs on right jap. terms, maybe?) then it could *attract* actual *Japanese* people (I'm sure they are also interested and to lesser degree but also use stackexchange.) (Eg. japanese.stackexchange.com seems to be doing very well.) Then we would got experts eventually.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Adding a personal FYI to my prev., I'm surprised that there are not more kana here. I expect a lot of kana on an anime site. (See, well, any other anime site! ;) )b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat thank you very much I keep it in mind!

Other than that, if you feel that the question should be reopened, edit it to improve its on-topicness then vote to reopen or flag it. Make sure to make it clear in a comment or the flag message why it should be reopened. Also, we're almost always active in chat, jump in and discuss it with us as well.

Flavors: Imoutos (little sisters) and/or Tsundere characters

Description: Two of the most common moe archetypes. Tsundere gained a lot of popularity last decade, and are still going strong today. Little sisters aren't new, but in the past few years there have been a large number of shows focused on younger sisters (a so-called "imouto boom"). Plus, little sisters have existed since the beginning of time, so there are plenty of examples to work with even if you aren't following recent anime. 

Given that there are plenty of tsundere imoutos, it makes sense to put them together.

I think it might be good for browsing/searching. Since https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga are banned, I imagine these multiple history tags would add another level to the categorization. However, I am not sure whether it is useful in long term.

I don't think there is any harm leaving it there for a while. Tag merging can be done quickly, but it is harder to separate them out later. For favorite (following) purpose, people can use *history to follow all history tags.

I personally haven't found any use for it, and there's no one following either of the two less-common tags so it's hard to believe that anyone else has. If there's evidence that it's helping someone, then it might be worth keeping them separate, but I don't see any such evidence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM: The number of follows is somewhat proportional to the number of questions. Less common tags are less likely to be followed. I would imagine that these specific tags adds another level to the categorization (since anime and manga tags are banned).


















The problem we are having with questions such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3758/list-of-anime-with-correct-animation-of-the-characters-playing-musical-instrumenthis one is that the scope can be too broad at times and be ambiguous or hard to completely answer.

Jon Lin puts it quite well https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-site/574#574here. To come up with a complete answer, at least in principle you would need to know about every anime ever. That isn't feasible, so every answer on such questions would necessarily be incomplete.

After some debate in out http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/conversation/list-questions-revisited-how-to-deal-with-in-and-out-of-univese-questions-77th Chat Cast, we decide that questions that ask for an out-of-universe list are discouraged (but you are welcome to ask them in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/anime-and-mangaour chatroom) and will usually be to be closed as "Not Constructive," however exceptions will be made depending on how well-defined the scope of the question is.

LoganM makes a good point http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/6697?m=9603152#9603152here:


  In situations like the one Jon Lin mentioned ("How many Lupin III movies/specials didn't have Fujiko?") it is reasonable to keep the question open, because it's only drawing from a small set of anime in the first place.

Full disclosure: My own opinion is admittedly biased. As some of you know, I consider myself a visual novel fan first and an anime/manga fan only after that. Hence, I'm interested in these sorts of questions probably more than the average user here.



Japanese visual novels tend to be rather closely related to anime and manga. Adaptations going both ways are fairly common. A lot of notable people in visual novel production are also involved in anime/manga, and vice-versa. It's also true that there are a lot of questions which could be asked about visual novel production

This situation is the same with light novels and manga, but different from other media we allow, like (most) anime-style games, manhua, manhwa, and anime-style cartoons. These categories are related to anime and manga in that their fanbases are nearly identical, but on the producer side they aren't typically closely related, so it doesn't make much sense to include production questions about these media except when there is a clear connection to anime production. For visual novel production, on the other hand, it does make sense to allow such questions on an "Anime & Manga" site.



With that in mind, I think we should allow questions regarding the production of visual novels, with some restrictions analogous to those for anime production.


Questions should be about how authentic Japanese visual novels are actually produced, not about how best to produce your own visual novel. The latter category is off-topic, though it might be welcome at https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/GameDev.SE.
Questions should not be overly technical. This is also a requirement for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production which is admittedly vague. I hope we can sort it out in the near future, but for now, a good way to look at it is, if a question would only be of interest to those who want to make their own visual novels, and not to average fans of the medium, then it's probably too technical. Programming and software questions in particular tend to fall into this category. (Note that this is unrelated to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11/24Are questions about technical aspects of visual novels on-topic?, which is a separate issue entirely and which I'm not discussing here.)


In particular, questions about the production about a specific visual novel are allowed, as are questions about the visual novel industry in general, but questions asking about specific technical issues which might arise in producing a visual novel belong elsewhere.



Regarding the https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/420/24question mentioned above, I think it's borderline. It is asking about how authentic Japanese visual novels are produced. I'm not sure if it's too technical or not, but certainly anything much more technical than this should not be allowed. I'd lean slightly towards reopening it, but I don't have strong feelings either way. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's exactly my opinion. If the question is about the cultural, language, or conceptual aspect, it should be on topic here. Technical questions should not.


















Uploading 1MB images or even 300KB images in a question or answer is often unnecessary/overkill and slows down page loads significantly especially when viewing on a mobile connection. Similarly, really large dimensions are often pointless due to real-estate restrictions. 

How can I keep file sizes down or adjust the dimensions of the images to reasonable and sensible numbers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can I streamline images and screenshots I embed into my post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the information! Could you edit it to be more like a question and answer pair? Don't forget you can answer your own questions! The question could be something like "how can I optimize the images I embed into my post?". Then your info fits perfectly as an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha Good point and done.


















If you don't have the wherewithal to optimise an image prior to upload, here are a few tips on doing so directly on AnimeSE:

After embedding an image to your post, you should see an imgur URL similar to https://i.stack.imgur.com/FOSov.pnghttp://i.stack.imgur.com/FOSov.png (just using this as an example). This should result in a large image (190KB, a relatively reasonable size, but even this can be optimised further):



But this image can now be optimised even further simply by tweaking the URL being used. For example tweaking the URL to http://i.stack.imgur.com/FOSovt.png (note that the filename now has an t (for small thumbnail) at the end) will result in an image of smaller size and dimension:



This file is only 3.5KB in size and also smaller in terms of dimensions.

If the dimensions are unsuitable add an m (for medium thumbnail) or an l (for large thumbnail) instead. This will result in the following images respectively:


 (9.7KB)
 (25.7KB)


Other options that also appear to work are:


b (Big square crop)  (38 KB)
h (Huge thumbnail (1024x1024))  (190KB)
s (Small square cropped thumbnail)  (15.6KB)


(I have no idea why the "square thumb" image is ~5KB larger than the "medium" one.)



If you'd nevertheless prefer viewers to be able to view your uploaded image in all its raw glory, simply link an optimised image to it by wrapping the code like this:

[![...my optimised image!][2]][1]


This will link the thumbnail to the original source file, like so:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/FOSov.png

In other words, those wanting to view a higher resolution [1] can do so by simply clicking on the thumbnail [2].



If these options are too complicated, just blindly add an l to the image filename in your post. This should display it in large dimensions and still load fast.

I should also note that anime/cartoon images generally tend to be more optimisable than photographs, etc.

I think we should allow these questions (so long as they pertain to anime).

As far as I can tell, there are no legal issues involved as long as we restrict to legal releases. There's a bit of grey area as to what is a legal release in some countries, but it's pretty clear that in practice this means that licensed releases are acceptable, while fansubs aren't.

Since there's no legal issues, assuming the question asked is answerable (like the one linked above) the only arguments that I can see against such a question are that they are too localized and/or are typically too easy to answer. The latter isn't really true; wading through the difficult licensing issues, incomplete news articles, and various companies' websites is a pretty daunting task. By comparison, oftentimes an expert will know the answer immediately. If anime licensing were documented uniformly and well on Wikipedia or ANN, there might be a good argument for such questions being too basic, but the documentation there can out-of-date, incomplete, or altogether wrong.

As for the question of whether these questions are too localized, consider that we are allowing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise questions, i.e. questions about promotional materials released in conjunction with an anime. My interpretation of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/484/24this question is that the community consensus is to allow such merchandise questions, though I suppose that's still up for some debate. We've even allowed cases where the merchandise in question was released in countries other than Japan (see e.g. https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3429/24What are the 2003 Wendy's Promotional Pokémon Toys?). If those sorts of questions are on topic, it seems like questions about releases of the actual anime should be at least as acceptable, if not more.

It might be worth creating a tag for all questions asking about home releases of an anime if this is something that a lot of people find uninteresting. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise could probably be used for this, though a different tag might be warranted as well since these questions require different knowledge to answer than most https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise questions.

It's worth noting that we have precedent for allowing such questions. Here are four open questions which are in the same vein as the linked question, asking about releases of anime/manga. If we were to ban such questions, all of these would need to be closed:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/112/24Why weren't Kingdom Heart volumes released regularly?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/56/24Was the ufotable Touhou anime ever released?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3306/24Was anything past volume 7 ever released in English?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3727/24Is Guilty Crown on DVD in the USA, UK, or Australia?


For the question regarding Disney releases of Ghibli movies, the current phrasing is a bit non-constructive even though the underlying question (Is there any digital distribution of Ghibli films through Disney?) is fine. It could be improved easily by making the question more clear and objective. The title should also probably be clarified. This is all pretty standard cleanup, and assuming no one else does it in the meantime I'll try to do it soon, though I don't think it's strictly necessary here.

However, of the example questions listed in the OP, I don't think questions about the "best place to buy that limited edition figure or CD of featuring their favorite character or show" should be allowed here. These are shopping questions, and there are http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/many problems associated to them. The "best place to buy" is always going to be a subjective question. There are plenty of questions about anime figures and other merchandise which I think would be acceptable, but anything asking us to compare products or vendors isn't constructive.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I concur with the last two paragraph: a basic cleanup can improve this kind of questions according to current rules. Since this is a kind of question usually asked by newcomers, an [approach like this one about downvoting newcomers](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/437/98) should be adopted.


















One can argue that these are too localized:


  This question is unlikely to help any future visitors; it is only
  relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an
  extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to
  the worldwide audience of the internet. For help making this question
  more broadly applicable, see the FAQ.


A question on where to buy certain manga/anime/franchise, will usually only apply to a certain city/town in a certain state/country.

An answer applicable to US folks will not apply to me, who live in Israel. Furthermore, an answer applicable to New York folks, won't necessarily apply to folks from Texas, etc. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with your interpretation of this. [According to this MSO post](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/87415/184716), too localized is not the same thing as mentioning a location/time, but rather the location must be small enough that it really isn't useful to anyone. Since licensing is almost universally done by country (so that a question by someone in NY would apply to someone in TX), I don't think that one can argue it's a small geographic area.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, there are really only a small number of countries in which anime/manga even get licensed. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anime_companies#Non-Japanese_companies) only lists licensing organizations from NA, Europe, and Australia, and outside those regions it's rather uncommon. Outside those regions, many people import those releases, which sort of makes these questions applicable to a pretty broad audience.


















The summer season of anime starts soon (most premiers are in July). Currently airing series tend to generate a lot of interest and consequently a lot of traffic, so it would be good if we could get some high-quality questions about them. However, we also need those questions to get answered well, which requires that we have members here who are knowledgeable about such series.

With that in mind, I had the idea of informally polling here on meta to get a sense of what series are good fits for our community. This isn't intended to be used for any official business, but it will help some people (like me) decide what series are good to ask about. Of course, you're welcome to ask about a series even if it isn't here.

Factoring in expected popularity and our community's strengths, what series from summer 2013 would make good material to ask about?

For simplicity, let's keep it to one anime per answer. Upvote if you think it's a good choice to ask about. Feel free to leave a comment if you're planning on watching that series, or if you consider yourself especially knowledgeable about it (e.g. you've read the manga). I'm posting this rather early so that there's plenty of time for people to check out the source material, previous seasons, and whatever promotional videos have been released before the season stars.

So, it's primarily in terms of what members of our community are already knowledgeable about, as well as overall popularity. Having potential for interesting questions doesn't hurt either, though. This post is pretty experimental, so feel free to answer on whatever basis you like.


















Dangan Ronpa



This series is based off of a game which has a ginormous English fanbase, mostly thanks to a playthrough thread on SA I believe. I expect that the anime will experience decent popularity since fans who don't know Japanese can experience the story "first hand" for the first time.

I don't know too much about the series, but it seems to have a good amount of characters and a complex (or at least more complex than most anime lately...) plot, so it should be full of questions. We could also get new members who have read the playthrough and can answer these questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm pretty familiar with the original game, so if the adaptation is pretty faithful I can answer questions about this. I'm not sure if I'll watch the anime though.


















I've compiled a list of questions which I believe can be answered (or improved with new answers) by someone who is an expert in one or more of the series (or tags) the question is related to.

At least half of these questions will not necessarily have sources to cite, so they will rely upon the answerer to be familiar enough with the series to back up his statements.

Unanswered questions

  Almost definitely have an answer

I would wager that almost every question on this list can be answered. I haven't seen all the series, so I can't be positive on that. However, these all seem to be related to material (and asked in such a way) that they can be answered either by carefully Googling or by an expert in the series/area addressed.

Questions that can use better (or more) answers

Our answer ratio is currently sitting at 1.5. However, I don’t know how exactly it’s calculated, so I’m not sure how many answers we really need to improve our stats in that area. There are still some questions that need improvement, though.

This is a sort of meta-answer rather than an actual answer. I searched on MAL for all series which will air next season. I then sorted them by number of users listing the series as "plan to watch", and recorded the top 30 (all with over 1000 users). The results are below.

Note, however, that this is just the number of people saying that they plan to watch the series. It's not a terribly good estimate for the actual numbers of viewers. In particular, shows with large existing fanbases are overrated, while sleeper hits won't become clear until we have at least a few episodes to judge by. It also indicates absolutely nothing about our community's strengths or what will make for good questions, just a crude estimate of the overall size of the fanbase.

Sadly, it seems that links don't work inside tables, so I made sure to use the same name as the MAL page.

Feel free to update this table, but if you do please update the whole table, not just a single series.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a good method Logan, similar to those I used in [my graph here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/616/98) for Winter 2013 (any slice is composed by user following anime from those studios). However, before first episodes are aired you'll get confusing results in my experience. Consider that Maoyu now is the first in the list with about 49,000 members who has the anime in their lists and before airing was 4th with about 5,000 members.


















Our questions per day stat has recently been dropping pretty dramatically. A month ago, we had 5.4 questions per day averaged over the past two weeks. Today, that number is 2.9 questions per day. So far this month, we've never once been above 5 Q/D, hovering between 3 and 4 most of the time, while in April and May our average was definitely above 5 Q/D.

That represents roughly a 40% decrease in the rate of new questions in one month, which is a big deal. Area51's guidelines are that 5 Q/D is "Okay" and 15 is "Excellent". I'm not convinced that these are the correct levels, and two recent graduated sites (Christianity and RPG) both had below 4 Q/D when they graduated, so apparently SE isn't totally convinced either. However, we're getting to the point where it's worth having a real serious look at whether we're getting enough questions just to keep the site thriving.

It's pretty easy to tell why this drop has occurred. In previous months high-rep users were throwing out lots of questions essentially as a form of seeding. This was in conjunction with successful https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/539/24flavor days and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/510/24April Fools day, which generated a lot of questions as well. The results were clearly pretty positive, as in the past two month period our traffic has increased by 217%, much of it from searches for these seeding questions. Nowadays most of the questions are coming in from new users with real legitimate non-seeding questions, which are ultimately the goal of this site. Flavor day still exists but only brings in a few questions, and high rep users have been less interested in asking their own questions.

I can see both benefits and detriments to having fewer questions asked with most of them coming from new users. For one, I suspect it will lead to fewer niche questions, and the few experts here won't be overwhelmed with the number of incoming questions. From https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/490/24this earlier post, our answer statistics aren't amazing (one of the lowest in the network for answer ratio), and this will probably improve them over time. In my opinion, our biggest problem right now is the small number of experts, especially given the amount of material which is on topic here. Anything which helps mitigate this problem is worth considering. 

However, there are real negatives of having fewer questions per day as well, in that it slows our site growth, potentially misses great seeding questions, and can worsen http://mikepascucci.com/2009/03/30/the-empty-restaurant-syndrome/empty restaurant syndrome. Regular users may also get bored and check back less frequently or leave entirely. I've noticed less activity in chat recently, which could be an indicator of this.

Should we start worrying about the decrease in Q/D now? If not, when (if ever) should we start worrying? Also, should we combat this by seeding questions or some other means?

For reference, we're nowhere near the bottom on Q/D. 3.0 questions per day is still tied with or beating roughly 30 existing sites, a few of which are launched sites. By contrast, we're 8th lowest in total number of users, which is a real problem here. However, that still puts us in the bottom third of the network, while we were above the median just a couple months ago.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we be worried about the recent drop in questions being asked?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we should be concerned, but the question shouldn't be limited to should we seed questions, but rather what's keeping users from asking questions? Are they too hard? Not interesting? Or something else all together?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer I agree that there is more to it than just seeding. Answers suggesting ways to get greater new user participation are certainly also welcome (hence the "some other means" in the third question).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think we should look into seeding questions again quite yet. I personally found a decent amount of the seeded questions uninteresting which in turn made me less interested in checking the site as often. Besides, if we can only survive by seeding questions then we probably aren't "meant to be".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My 2c: The reason I don't participate is because a) I have little expert knowledge. Thus a lot of the questions are unanswerable to me, unless it's a simple in-canon answer about a show/manga I've seen/read b) I can't think of good questions to ask. With few exceptions answers are either in the short canon, or are unanswerable without new Word from God. The exceptions tend to be long running series ala Bleach/Naruto where the canon is too large to reasonably check through myself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion the question asking rate should be different for every SE site. In the end there is a finite number of things in the world, and it is possible to ask all the questions that are worth asking. Besides, there are other sites than SE network on the internet where fans (especially fans) can get their info, since such things as anime tend to have many fansites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**First**, since Anime and Manga are highly debatable (unless it is something canon), it is harder for users to ask something that complies to the site rule, therefore leading to fewer questions/day.

**Second**, die-hard anime & manga fans would most likely know something that is canon, therefore they need not to ask about it. The non-die-hard one most of the time won't bother asking as they are watching anime & reading manga just as a way to pass time & not really into it.


















I'm thinking of several options:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rosario-plus-vampirerosario-plus-vampire (I think that's the best option).
Another workaround is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rosario%2b%2bvampirerosario++vampire.


We could synonym as well.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We debated this in chat, and decided to drop the + (or "plus"), as it is not important enough to keep. Plus, as Jon Lin says, most places where the + looks off, they simply use "rosario-vampire".


















What's wrong with just https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rosario-vampirerosario-vampire? That shorthand is used in a lot of places where the "+" looks out of place (like in blog post URLs).

MAL has the entry a "Rosario to Vampire" but that romanization seems to be an outlier.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5for this one, I agree that we should change it to [tag:rosario-vampire]. The "+" is not important enough to be distinct here, unlike how it is with [tag:blood+]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The + symbol is read as と (to, Japanese for "and"). You can even see that the と is included in the logo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rosario_%2B_vampire_vol_1_shueisha.jpgb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza But IMO, if we went for the romanization, we should also write "banpaia" instead of "vampire".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Though, I think it's important to have the official romanization in the tag wiki (with the "+", or whatever).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Those are two completely separate issues. Besides, even the image I linked actually says "vampire".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza I think the problem with using the [tag:rosario-and-vampire] romanization is that it's not used in any official capacity. Case in point: [Funimation's pages](http://www.funimation.com/rosario-vampire/trailer/complete-season-one/7376531) has it typed with a "+" but the URL has it completely omitted ("rosario-vampire"). I think using an `-and-` is fine too, both are better than using the awkward looking "+" sign.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wasn't necessarily trying to say we should use one specific version of the + (whether it's +, to, or and) but rather it is part of the title and should be included in some capacity since this isn't a case of a title being longer than max tag length.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza I don't think the +/plus/to/and is essential, but if you really do feel strongly about this, maybe you should create an answer expressing this, rather than discussing it in comments. That way the community can express they're agreement with you better. :)


















I'm gonna play devil's advocate and dare to say that we don't actually need them at the moment.

How many questions do we actually close? As far as I can tell, not a lot.

On bigger sites like SO, the canned off-topic close reasons are to save time when there are literally thousands of questions that need to be closed. But on Anime.SE, we have so few question closures that we actually have the man-power to consider each one on a case-by-case basis. Quite often, we end up debating the status of a question in chat anyway.

So in short, if it doesn't fit one of the existing reasons, I'd say we should just do the custom "other" close reason and explain our case. I don't think we don't have enough traffic to get a good picture on what the "average" off-topic question is like.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure I totally agree here; yes, we have the manpower to deal with each one on a case-by-case basis, but does that mean we shouldn't take advantage of the resources we have at our disposal?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric We could, but I don't want us to "try too hard" to make up reasons if we're not going to use them. The existing one that Shog added is good. But other than that, the point is that we don't get enough closures to get an idea of what the "average" reason is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that we shouldn't be *searching* for reasons, but I think we should at least hit the common ones. Shog's, as well as any in the FAQ that are explicitly labeled (but aren't related to other SE sites).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric I can't think of a single common reason besides the one that Shog came up with. And he probably went through the list of closed questions to determine that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Out-of-universe list questions comes to mind here. It's a reasonably new thing we've changed, so there aren't a lot of closed questions, but I think they definitely warrant their own reason as they're even in the FAQ at this point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric Wait, since when did we ban out-of-universe questions? Wouldn't that just destroy the [tag:tropes] tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Out-of-universe **list** questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric How many of those do we actually get? I'd go for a more generic one that applies to all inappropriate list questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial We've had several questions asking for lists of anime. Many of them are still open, but they should all be closed.


















Although I understand your concern, either you provided a bad example question or I just don't agree with you. That question needs to be closed, even if it is a question by a new user. You said it yourself in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4247/kenpachi-versus-shunsui#comment3514_4247a comment you left there:  


  The question you asked will invite opinion-based answers and might cause never-ending speculated answers and it means it can't really be answered. The answers won't have reliable source that can back it up since it is purely based on the user's opinions.  


Plus, if you read https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askthis in the help center, you'll see the question just does not fit the SE model. This is taken from "What types of questions should I avoid asking?":  


  you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”  


And just to finish things off, just read the first paragraph of the http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/06/the-war-of-the-closes/?cb=1latest SE blog post:  


  It pains me when I hear people say that our sites are unfriendly, or that we chase new users away. But it’s a hard problem, because our highest priority has always been the quality of content on our sites.  And it still is. We can’t lower our standards. We won’t.




Having said this, I understand that sometimes we may seem harsh on new users, and that could be solved by commenting instead of downvoting. However, that's not always the case, as some questions are just plain bad or simply do not fit the Q&A model we have. Now the important part here, is that whenever you close a question, you should leave a comment explaining why you did it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An addendum: Even more now than prior to the new close reasons, users are encouraged to edit their questions to be better. They will automatically be populated in the reopen queue if the user edits it, and we can decide that it is good enough to be reopened. That is ultimately up to the user, though, so it's important they understand *why* their question is wrong and let them fix it. (But "closing" it in the meantime is in no way harmful.)


















If done right, this (at least the new show) could be useful for generating questions about currently airing shows, which are likely to bring an increase in traffic during their airtime. If we are going to do that, we should probably pick something that looks to be relatively popular. Not necessarily the top show of the season, but something that a significant number of people are watching and which will bring in some traffic.

I'm a bit less enthusiastic about the older shows, mostly because it's going to vary who has seen what. Legal free distribution methods are also less common for older shows. I still think it could work, but it's not as convenient as watching a new show as it airs.

How to coordinate it seems like the biggest issue. First, there's not going to be a time block that works for everyone. In addition, it's not totally clear to me what we're supposed to discuss. Are we going to be watching the anime and simultaneously commenting, or watching on our own and then gathering every week to talk about the episode, or something else?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5most likely the latter (watch and then discuss).


















EDIT: These questions should be closed as "too broad", with a comment explaining that such questions are not allowed and linking to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/587/24How should we deal with out-of-universe list questions in general?. A separate close reason is not necessary in this case.



We have a bunch of old questions which ask for lists of anime or manga (out-of-universe lists). Some are still open, while others were closed for a fairly wide variety of reasons (which were usually controversial). Our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/587/24new policy on this is that questions asking for a list like this should be closed. Hence, I propose the following close reason:


  Questions asking for a list of anime, manga, characters from multiple series, or other out-of-universe lists are off-topic as they are impossible to answer completely and often opinion-based. See: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/587/24How should we deal with out-of-universe list questions in general?


It would be nice for this to be added as a custom close reason so that we can go clean up these questions. That would also alert future readers that such questions are no longer allowed here.

Here are some questions which would fall into this category:

These are still under debate, and are at least as common as the above, but in my opinion they're acceptable until they turn into invitations for people to post more examples without adding any further content. If a question of this form is getting lots of examples posted when it's already answered (which are not better answers than the original), it should be protected and/or closed under either this reason or "too broad". I haven't checked which (if any) questions like this deserve to be closed right now.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pet_Girl_of_SakurasouSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is an LN with a recent anime adaptation. The tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sakurasou-no-pet-na-kanojosakurasou-no-pet-na-kanojo is 26 characters, which just barely doesn't fit, so the user who created it https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4482/why-is-maid-chan-voice-actor-listed-as-in-ending-creditshere used https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sakurasou-no-petsakurasou-no-pet instead. This is a reasonable choice, but not necessarily the best one. There is an English name, "The Pet Girl of Sakurasou", which would fit at 25 characters if we used https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-pet-girl-of-sakurasouthe-pet-girl-of-sakurasou. Personally I've not heard the English title used much. 

What tag should we use for this series?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we tag Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I came here to suggest the english name.. it fits within SE's restrictions and _is_ valid. So I say use it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iKlsR That's a reasonable suggestion, but it should probably be an answer so that people can vote on it.


















The english tag name https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-pet-girl-of-sakurasouthe-pet-girl-of-sakurasou works as it is valid, legible and is nested within SE's tag naming restrictions so I say use it instead.

On your comment about the popularity of the english title, "sakurasou" is present in both so it should be found quite easily.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1, though still waiting to hear other opinions. Two of the three keywords in the two titles are the same, namely Sakurasou and Pet. Kanojo vs Girl are different, but it shouldn't hurt too much w.r.t. search traffic since both are common words in their respective languages anyway. We do also tend to prefer the English titles, at least when they're popular or recognizable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, people are probably going to type "Sakurasou" first and the autocompletion should show the corresponding tag. For now I'll just edit both of my questions for that tag to use [tag:the-pet-girl-of-sakurasou] tag.


















I've discovered this section of Stack Exchange and I like it.  However, the icon here is confusing me.



What is this?  Perhaps a Japanese character?  If so what does it mean?  Is it open to change?

I have seen other beta sites that have the blue background with something special (like the https://bricks.stackexchange.com/Lego one)



Also, there are multiple icons that are just the blue background with a couple letters from the page title, like https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/Board Games


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the icon?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the meaning, check out [this post](https://www.facebook.com/AnimeAndMangaQA/posts/556218247744619) from our facebook page. There we explain the meaning of that kanji, which is used in our community logo.


















This is the temporary icon given to us (this site, http://anime.stackexchange.comhttp://anime.stackexchange.com) by Stack Exchange.

It will (maybe) change when we graduate, and we can try to ask for it to be changed, if you propose an alternative, and it gets voted positively here on meta.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But what is the current one?  I've seen many similar icons that just have letters but this one id unique.  I'll add some more to the question.


















The icon is the kanji 画, which can mean either brush-stroke or picture (the latter seems to be the meaning intended here). It has many different pronunciations (my dictionary lists 9) so I won't list them all here. It is used in a number of art-related Japanese words, including the words for picture (画像), artist (画家), and to draw (画する). Perhaps most relevant for this site, it's also used in manga (漫画).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't speak for Jin (the Great Bacon-eating SE Design Overload), but I assume that since 動画 and 漫画 shared a character that it was used.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer That's plausible. As a note to anyone who doesn't know Japanese, 動画 is the Japanese word for animation (though *anime* is written in katakana as アニメ, being the shortened form of the word "animation" borrowed in Japanese, and doesn't include 画).


















Related to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/646/how-should-we-tag-sakurasou-no-pet-na-kanojoHow should we tag Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo?

I've searched on some sites that follow anime and manga to see if the Japanese have a shortened name for it, but so far nothing came up. Since I needed to tag a question and it was late at night I settled on Denpa-Onna, but there are a few other works that have that in their name.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we tag Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which other works have Denpa Onna as their title?


















The generic advice for how to name series tags is https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/521/24here but most of those do not apply for this series. 

Neither the English name "Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl" nor the Japanese title "Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko" fits without cutting something out. The English name would need to be trimmed to just https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/psychoelectric-girlpsychoelectric-girl, which is probably not the best option. I tried a http://www.googlebattle.com/?domain=%22denpa+onna%22&domain2=%22psychoelectric+girl%22&submit=Go%21Google battle and "Denpa Onna" is 20 times as common as "Psychoelectric Girl", which I think is the sort of extreme case in which we should be using the Japanese name. Personally, I'd never even heard of the English name before looking for it.

I think the best option is probably https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/denpa-onna-seishun-otokodenpa-onna-seishun-otoko which fits at 24 characters. We cut out the "to", in Japanese means "and", so there's basically no loss of information and all the keywords are present.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for this.. [denpa-onna] is also viable as it is the shortened name the wiki uses.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[denpa-onna] is another valid choice. I slightly prefer the longer tag as it has all the keywords, but IMO it's not going to make a significant difference either way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since a week has gone by, and no one else seems to have an opinion on this matter, I retagged the question according to this answer ([tag:denpa-onna-seishun-otoko] is now the tag in use).


















I'm not a fan of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/general-mangageneral-manga. It has most of the problems that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga would have had (hence why it's blacklisted), namely that it would be incorrectly applied frequently and too broad. It seems to subsume all other manga-specific tags, such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production, at least in principle. Furthermore, I literally can't imagine any other questions which would be in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/general-mangageneral-manga that are not already covered by one or more existing tags. Rather, when questions like this come up, we should find more specific tags for them.

In my view, a better tag for this question would be a fairly specific tag for this sort of question, namely https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/panel-arrangementpanel-arrangement or something similar. This would include all questions asking about the flow of a specific page of manga, and it could be useful for future askers in a relatively small number of cases. For example, I still get confused occasionally when reading shoujo manga, as (for whatever reason) it often has much more complicated arrangements than most other genres. There's quite a bit more to how panels are arranged than just "read left-to-right" so I think the tag makes sense, though it will probably be a low-volume tag.

Finally, regarding this particular question, I think it should be edited to be more descriptive. The OP isn't really looking for the "general rule" of what the right order to read the panels is. The general rule, insofar as one exists, is to read right-to-left, and the OP already knew this. There are exceptions to that rule, which is why https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/panel-arrangementpanel-arrangement isn't totally trivial, but that's the only simple "general rule" which exists. What the OP really wants to know is how he should read this particular page of manga and why it is not in the usual arrangement. He may have been looking for a rule that can be applied in all such cases, but with the number of exceptions and special cases such a question is probably closeable as "too broad". Making it specific to this particular page of the Naruto manga in both the title and question body would make the question more objectively answerable, avoid spoilers for future viewers, and pave the way for occasional future questions in the same vein about different confusing pages.

So in summary, the changes I suggest (both for this question and in terms of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/general-mangageneral-manga) are:


Keep https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto on the question
Add https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/panel-arrangementpanel-arrangement to this question
Remove https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/general-mangageneral-manga from this and any other questions
Make the question title and body specific to this page of manga

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`panel-arrangement` seems like a very niche tag, would there be any other cases would there would be some merit to using this tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer As I said, I've had situations while reading manga where I'm not exactly sure what's going on in a particular scene, so I can imagine using it myself occasionally. I tried to come up with something broader which would cover all questions regarding what is happening in a particular manga scene, but everything I could come up with either seemed too broad or to invite undesirable questions like "Where can I read manga X?". If you have a better suggestion then feel free to give it, as I agree [panel-arrangement] is a bit specific; I just couldn't come up with anything better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a note, in case anyone doesn't believe that panel arrangements can get pretty complicated, here's [an example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sVa8t.png) from the shoujo manga Oniisama e.... There are probably better examples if you look, but this was one of the first pages I saw and it's already not entirely clear to me what the "right" order is to read the panels in, at least at first glance. I do agree that no matter what [panel-arrangement] will be somewhat a niche tag, but this probably won't be the only question and at any rate a niche tag doesn't necessarily seem like a problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My vote is cast on this one. However narrow the subject, [tag:panel-arrangement] seems best fit for this kind of question.


















I think a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/general-mangageneral-manga would be considered a meta-tag per: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/

The reason meta-tags are a problem is that they do not describe the content of the question. They describe some other aspect of the question, like the author’s skill level, or the author’s motivation for asking it, or generally what “kind” of question it is (poll, how-to, etc.).
Meta-tags are actually a subset of a larger problem that I usually call dependent tags. These are tags that don’t say anything by themselves – you can’t tell what the question is about unless they’re paired with some other tag (or several of them). These tags are a problem because people don’t realize this and will often use that as the question’s only tag.

I propose https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-readingmanga-reading as it describes the content of the question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[tag:manga-consumption] to me seems like questions about things like manga sales (e.g. [this question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4503/24)), not how to read manga. I might suggest the term [tag:manga-reading] instead, which is a bit broader than the suggestion in my answer [tag:panel-arrangement] but still specific enough. The only issue with that name is that it almost invites questions like "where can I read manga X online for free" which we definitely don't want.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I can see that, I agree that manga-reading is better, I'll edit my post (consumption vs production - producer-consumer, was how i came up with the tag, comes from my programming background i guess). I don't think the tag itself will invite question like "where can i read" though, since in my experience, tags are something you add after writing a question.


















I think it can probably be umbrellaed under https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resourcesresources, maybe? I think questions pertaining to sites like nicodouga or 2ch are relevant as long as the question is about anime and manga, and not about the site specifically. In that sense, nicodouga or 2ch could be considered a "resource" related to the anime or manga in question.

The question about thesubwire.com is a little meta or borderline. The issue that I think should be raised is that sites like that are illegal. The subwire site specifically hosts translations of copyrighted works, which are protected by international copyright law from being translated without the copyright holder's consent. Subtitles, scanlations, and full-on translations of novels are all completely illegal and vary in degree how much the copyright holders are willing to pursue their rights.

I don't know what took down the site in question but asking for such a site, IMO, is like asking for fansubs.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5they don't host anything, all they do is list when the subs/scans/translations are releasedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ton.yeung It [appears they let you download stuff](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qevLi.png) but if linking to illegal material is ok with site policy, then it's a moot pointb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5those are links to torrents, not stuff hosted on their site (qualifies under safe haven)


















Why not simply use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sakurasousakurasou and note its full name in the description? Alternatives can be added as synonyms.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like this idea. This tag looks very nice compared to parts of the full name.



















  Questions on future events with regard to the production of an anime or manga are off-topic, as such details are only known to the creators of said works and should be checked on anime news sources. See: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27/what-do-we-do-with-questions-about-future-events-releasesWhat do we do with questions about future events/releases?


For questions on future releases, news and whatnot.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Doesn't seem necessary to add at the moment, but it's good to have here so that if it does become necessary we can add it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This has been implemented now, but I wonder if we could change it to be specifically about *unannounced* future events. As far as I know, asking about future events which have been announced is still considered acceptable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, you have a point. I'll change it accordingly.


















I posted links to Baka-updates and mangaupdates earlier and the links were removed with the reason being it was a link to an illegal fan sub / scanlations site. However Bakaupdates is neither a fan sub group or a scans group. They are simply just an updates website. There is actually nothing illegal about that website. They provide the info for the latest releases as well as the info for who subbed / translated them.

With that said, is there also a major difference between writing the name of the site and then adding the .com at the end to make it a link?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should sites like Bakaupdates be banned?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a note, many other useful sites track fansub groups for shows, such as AniDB and MAL. In addition, VNDB (probably the largest VN database in English) tracks fan-translations/patches. I think it would be a shame that we couldn't reference such sites just because they contain information about illegal downloads.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I referenced MAL in the same post as well, but that link was not removed. Only Baka and mangaupdatesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@atlantiza Just information shouldn't be enough to be ban-worthy. We really want to be as inclusive as possible, but maintain a professional image, which in my view stops just short of direct links to fansub/scanalation sites/groups with the intent of distributing the content rather than answering the question. Also, as a note, I've created what I hope will be a canonical list of such references [here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4696/24). Feel free to add your own (that's why it's community wiki).


















I don't think these should have been removed, as you're right that it only tracks edits and doesn't contain any links to the content (even if it did, it's debatable whether it should be removed). I've rolled back the edits. We're in the midst of a discussion regarding what content is acceptable to link to, mostly in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/anime-and-mangachat. When there is a consensus you can expect a new meta post announcing this and also the decision to be added to the https://anime.stackexchange.com/helphelp center. Until then, apologies for the confusion, but it'll probably continue to be a bit confusing until we have a clear consensus.

As a note, our policy is mostly about maintaining a professional image, not copyright concerns. Copyright is handled by Stack Exchange directly, and the community here never gets involved. Our goal in limiting the discussion of fansubs/scanalations is to maintain a professional image, but the boundaries of that are still rather rough.

In fact, we discussed this particular answer. The conversation begins http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/10704108#10704108here but got somewhat sidetracked. However, I think everyone agreed in the end that there was nothing wrong with these links.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In that case, I'll be happy to simply prefer to add anidb and mangaupdates links as reference links :S FWIW, there was an earlier meta thread where this was discussed and to my memory, the general consensus was that WP and IMDB links were fine and MAL, Anidb links were not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The aforementioned (and original) thread is [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/389/is-it-allowed-to-talk-about-the-use-of-external-sites-such-as-myanimelist/396).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@coleopterist As far as I can tell, that one is specifically referring to asking questions about external sites, e.g. "On MAL, how can I search for all magical girl anime between 1980 and 2005?".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point. I misremembered it.


















I think we should keep the same idea as for the culture questions. Using https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4737/274the question you mentioned, its title does not even require the mention of an anime or manga, and could be only slightly modified to remove the manga reference, and still receive an almost-identical answer:

I've heard you can several computers and use P2P technology as a front to force them to decrypt a certain file.
Has such a event actually happened before?

If we look at the specific X-Y questions you mentioned, I think we may want to make a special case.


X happened in anime/manga Y. Is this actually possible/could it happen in real life?

No, this should not be on-topic. This would imply that all anime-goers have an intimate knowledge of the subject matter they see as it pertains to real life. I can honestly say that I do not have such knowledge of mechas, basketball, or time travel, but I still enjoy anime which cover those topics and still remain knowledgeable about those anime.
Additionally, if we allowed this type of question, you could basically ask any type of question here! "Is it possible to do a feint like Ryūichi in Ro-Kyu-Bu SS?" You can see our scope expanding into territory that goes far from anime and manga.

X was explained in anime/manga Y. Is this explanation correct?

No, this should not be on-topic. It essentially relies upon the same information as above. If I can't explain how something works, in all likelihood I can't tell you whether or not someone else's explanation is accurate.

What are the real-world inspirations for X in anime/manga Y?

YES! This should be on-topic. This information is almost always specific to that anime or manga, and is sometimes explained within the media itself, by interviews with staff on the project, or by materials such as art books and pamphlets about the series. Even if a casual viewer does not know the answer to this, it is likely that an expert in that anime or manga does.
Basically, this type of question should be allowed because it does not necessarily require an intimate knowledge of any subject outside of the anime or manga in question. It will also often be the case that removing mention of the media will make the question unintelligible or difficult for an expert to answer.

TL;DR: I think we should adopt the idea of, "If the purest form of this question is not answerable by a typical expert in the referenced anime, then it is off-topic." We could even simplify it further and follow https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/611/274the same path as culture questions and say, "If we can remove references to the anime and manga and still have a standalone, answerable question, then it is off-topic."
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think I understand your answer, but I'm not sure. What would you say to the following two questions (both from Steins;Gate)? "Are Kerr black holes real? How accurate is their description in Steins;Gate?" and "What are the differences between the original John Titor and the version in Steins;Gate?". (FWIW, I could easily and comprehensively answer the first, but not the second.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM The first could probably be asked as "Are Kerr black holes real? How do they function?" on physics.SE or a forum, so it stands alone and is off-topic here. The second is a bit iffier, as it's harder to remove the reference to *Steins;Gate* and still have a coherent question, but I think the focus is still largely on the *real* John Titor, so I would say off-topic as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You could ask about Kerr black holes on Physics SE or read the wiki article. However, even if you understood everything they told you, you wouldn't be able to answer the S;G question unless you *also* understood the description of them in S;G, which unlike the other questions is nontrivial. For one, it's not really explained fully in the anime, only in the VN. Also, the explanation is broken up into several dialogues. It seems to me that question requires at least a passable knowledge of S;G *in addition* to some knowledge of general relativity, so I'm not sure if it belongs or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM The first question can be split into two questions. One asked in Physics SE about Kerr black holes and one in this SE specifically about Kerr black holes in S;G. It keeps everything relevant and on topic for both respective SEs. Although I do feel like having an answer that compares and contrasts the anime's version versus a real life version is on topic, so maybe that makes the question on topic as well. While some of the questions recently seem completely unrelated to anime, one can always rework the question to force an anime related answer. Perhaps people need to modify their Q's.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@krikara Okay that makes sense to me. With that in mind I agree with this answer.


















You can find virtually all major manga/anime online at a lot of random sites, but is it right to support these sites. 

I thought the reason YouTube stopped allowing these to be shown was because of copyright violations.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is is legal/right to watch anime/read manga online?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We aren't here to make moral decisions for you. It's true that if you're watching anime through an unlicensed source, it probably violates copyright law. The ethics could be debated a great deal, but neither meta nor the main site is the place for that debate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After some very lengthy discussions, we've agreed to **professionally not care** about copyrighted material ***if*** it complements the post it is on. Adding a manga panel or two to aid with the answer is cool. Answering a question asking about where to watch anime online is not.


















Sometimes, I find myself wanting to cite a Japanese text as evidence for an answer to a question on Anime.SE. Japanese sometimes includes phonetic annotations called furigana, which look like this:



The small characters in the upper line of text are phonetic annotations that explain how the characters in the main (lower) line of text are read. 

In order to faithfully reproduce Japanese text, furigana are often necessary. This is particularly important for anime-related media (light novels, in particular), which frequently use completely nonstandard "phonetic" readings for various kanji (cf. 禁書目録 as インデックス in "A Certain Magical Index"). 

Japanese.SE already supports furigana in markdown. The example above (https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/12552/why-does-the-%E6%96%87%E8%AA%9E-version-of-the-bible-have-so-many-nonstandard-readingstaken from Japanese.SE) was generated using the following markdown:


  元始{はじめ}に神{かみ}　天地{てんち}を創造{つくり}たまへり


It's possible to do this in raw HTML using <ruby> and its friends, but that gets to be https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rubykind of verbose and a pain to type out by hand each time. Can we get support for the {} Markdown shorthand here, too?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we get furigana support here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great suggestion. We'll pass it up.


















For example, the Japanese title of http://myanimelist.net/anime/15863/Ginga_Kikoutai_Majestic_Princethe 2013 Spring anime that has AHSMBs in it is 銀河機攻隊マジェスティックプリンス. When giving a romanization (as opposed to a translation, which would be "Galactic Armored Fleet Majestic Prince" or something), should we romanize it as "ginga kikoutai majesutikku purinsu" or "ginga kikoutai majestic prince"? In my experience, the latter style is overwhelmingly favored among English-speaking anime communities on the internet. 

I'm asking because I noticed that the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-kagaku-no-railguntoaru-kagaku-no-railgun and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-majutsu-no-indextoaru-majutsu-no-index tag wiki excerpts use the romanizations "Rērugan" and "Indekkusu" respectively, while the tags themselves use the English analogues ("railgun" and "index"). Should we standardize on one style or the other for tags and tag wikis, and if so, which one?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we romanize English words that have been borrowed into Japanese?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Possible duplicate of [Should anime / manga names / tags be in English (international title) or romanized Japanese?](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/35)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha I think this is a separate issue from the question you linked. I'm not asking _whether_ we should romanize, but rather, assuming we do, _how_ we should go about it for a particular class of words.


















This is a very good addition, but we should be careful about overusing it. Keep in mind that lots of users here can't read any Japanese, including Hiragana/Katakana. Using furigana is not a substitute for including a translation, and in cases where the pronunciation is important, a romanization of the text as well. Furigana are very helpful for a minority of users in a minority of situations.

I think most people would find them most useful when the reading of a word is important and the intended reading is not the most common reading. For instance, from the example posted, 元始 is usually read as げんし, so the reading as はじめ is not obvious. Similarly, 創造 would normally be read as そうぞう, so including the furigana here is helpful. However, the readings of 神 and 天地 are the most common ones and would be recognizable for most users here who know any Japanese. If the person doesn't know these, what they should do is look them up in a dictionary, not look at furigana and try to guess the meaning of the word. If you use furigana it basically forces everyone to read the tiny text in case it's supposed to be read differently, and for most users here who are able to read the Japanese text it's a nuisance for two of those four words.

With that in mind, I think we should agree to use this sparingly. My criterion would be that if it's useful for someone who is fluent in Japanese, we can include it, but if it's only useful for those learning Japanese then don't include it. So if, for example, a light novel uses a nonstandard reading and you want to quote it (e.g. the example posted 禁書目録), go ahead, but don't add it to kanji that would be read correctly by those who are already familiar with the characters. Our goal isn't to teach people Japanese here; it's to have questions and answers about anime.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. I think the primary use of furigana here will be to accurately quote Japanese passages that are accompanied by a translation, so that Japanese-speaking users who subsequently read the passage can evaluate it for themselves, and possibly edit the translation as necessary. (FWIW the reason this came up is that I'm formulating an answer to the bountied Accelerator question, and part of it involves looking at the word 向き{ベクトル}, which would be nice to represent correctly, for fidelity's sake.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, that would be a good example where it would be helpful to have the furigana, since basically no one would read it correctly without it.


















I've seen a couple of those recently, and the trend seems to be accelerating. We still have a couple more custom close reasons to spare, so I'm thinking of adding it as our second close reason.

The phrasing would be something like:


  Questions requesting illegal copyrighted and/or licensed materials is off-topic on our site.

Recently there was the addition of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/viewing-orderviewing-order, a meta tag intended to tag questions which request the chronological or intended viewing order or a particular series. The following questions were suggested to be tagged:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4695/what-is-the-chronological-order-of-the-monogatari-seriesWhat is the in-universe chronological order of the Monogatari Series?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2650/what-is-the-proper-order-of-watching-hakuoukiWhat is the proper order to watch Hakuouki in?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2249/which-anime-episodes-of-aria-correspond-to-which-manga-chaptersWhich anime episodes of Aria correspond to which manga chapters?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/368/what-is-the-chronological-order-of-the-episodes-of-xxxholicWhat is the chronological order of the episodes of xxxHolic?

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4881/in-what-order-should-i-watch-daily-lives-of-high-school-boys-seriesIn what order should I watch Daily Lives of High School Boys series?

The Sci-fi & Fantasy StackExchange has https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/suggested-ordera 'suggested-order' tag which is similar to this idea. That said, this tag does not seem necessary, but there are pros and cons.
Pros

All viewing-order-related questions will be easily accessible.
Anyone wishing to answer only questions related to viewing order can have this tag followed.

Cons

It is highly unlikely that there can be an expert in viewing orders. This was largely the reason for avoiding meta tags thus far.
There probably won't ever be a question that will receive an answer from someone who had https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/viewing-orderviewing-order followed, but not any of the series in question.

Should we keep https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/viewing-orderviewing-order, or is this another meta tag that should go by the wayside?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we need a 'viewing-order' tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alrighty then. Sorry for causing some trouble by creating this tag. I also noticed there is another (similar, in my opinion) tag: [tag:reference]. Not sure if there can be a specialist in references either, so you guys decide if you want to get rid of that tag too. Just bringing this to your attention.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1306322 No need to apologize. As for [reference], I'll bring it up with some others and we'll see if it merits a tag. Thanks for the mention.


















I think we should get rid of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/viewing-orderviewing-order. I come to this conclusion based on the points I made in the question: There will probably not be an expert on viewing orders in general, and the answers will likely come from people who are intimate with the tagged series.

In lieu of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/viewing-orderviewing-order, any viewing-order-related questions should be tagged with any and all series that it pertains directly to. Some examples:


"What is the chronological order of the Monogatari Series?" https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monogatari-seriesmonogatari-series
"I want to watch all the Pokémon movies; in what order should I do so?" https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemonpokemon
"What is the viewing order of Robotics;Notes, Chaos;Head, and Steins;Gate?" https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/robotics-notesrobotics-notes https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chaos-headchaos-head https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/steins-gatesteins-gate


However, as mentioned, I do not believe that these questions warrant their own unique tag. Additionally, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/viewing-orderviewing-order should be removed from any existing questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Per consensus here, and in the absence of dissenting voices, I have removed [tag:viewing-order] from all questions that had it (and done a bit of cleanup along the way).


















Our policy is that we aren't lawyers, and won't prevent you from adding scanlated images or video links to episodes if your answer to a legitimate post can be improved by it.

As a general rule, Fansubbing and scanlation distribution is illegal on most countries (as well as the US, where SE is rooted). We just don't care if it's for the sake of making a post more high a quality, and no one seems to care (from the copyright holder's place)

We do care when someone deliberately asks for such information, because the answer itself, in its core, would be about something which is probably illegal.

Note that asking where you can read/watch manga/anime legally is not off-topic on this site.

But tell you what, open a new [meta-tag:feature-request] about it, suggest the possible points that needs to be changed/removed/added, and see how the community reacts. If we get solid opinion that something is really missing from there, we'll change it. When writing, think this way: "No user should ever visit meta to understand what questions are on or off topic on this site".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would if I could :) The reason I asked this question in the first place is because I don't fully understand any of it myself. So I'd rather somebody explain it all to me, and only then I could come up with all the right points to include in that feature request post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1306322: Do you still need help? It might be useful if you come to [chat] and discuss it directly with us (there's a bunch of us there almost at all times)


















I wish to address the situation that lead to this meta question rather than the topic of the question.

It seems after chatting with the user that this question is related to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/635/how-should-we-deal-with-new-users-posting-links-to-illegal-material-in-commentsmy meta question here. The OP of this question inserted in a comment on https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4273/24this question links to a manga page on a scanalation site and a YouTube video of a complete anime episode.

In this case, the link to the scanalation site was replaced by an image of the page in question, which was relevant. The YouTube video was removed. These actions were performed by a moderator after I flagged the comment explaining that the comment itself was helpful but the links should be changed or removed.

In the case of the scanalation website, I think this was actually an improvement to the quality of the comment. The current image is more stable (being uploaded to Stack Exchange's imgur account, it's immune to link rot except in very drastic cases). It also doesn't require users here to visit a site of questionable legality to see the content. Because the comment was just referencing the manga and had nothing to do with the scanalation site, there was no loss in content. For on-topic manga references, these can and should always be done via uploading an image with the upload feature and linking to them with [link text](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XXXXXXX). Even ignoring questions of legality, this style of manga references should always be preferred to linking to a page from a scanalation site for practical reasons, whether in questions/answers or comments.

The YouTube link was more questionable in my opinion. At first glance I could not see how it was relevant. I suspect there was relevant content there, but it was basically impossible to access because the video was too long. YouTube videos can be made to start at a particular point, which really would have helped demonstrate that the link was useful. Alternatively the user could give a screenshot of the relevant point of the video if it's a single frame. In any case, this link is more debatable than the other one, if only because YouTube is a more reputable site and the link was removed rather than being converted. I believe removing the link was an acceptable action mostly because it was not helpful in its present form (as a link to the beginning of the video rather than to the relevant point in the video). Another good option would be to find the relevant clip as a shorter video and link to that. If any of the above actions had been taken, I think the link could have probably stayed, but in its present form it was not useful and made us look unprofessional.

With all of that said, while the actions were justified, these are very understandable mistakes. Our policy on fansubs and scanalations is admittedly a bit hard to follow. As a general rule, links to scanalation sites should be replaced by uploaded images to imgur. Beyond that, so long as the links you post are in good faith, helpful, and aren't actively promoting copyright violations, they aren't really a problem in my opinion.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm almost sure the link to Youtube video had a timestamp, but then there really was nothing else I wanted to refer to in that video apart from a certain still frame, so I should have made a screenshot instead. Lesson learned, I think there should be a note somewhere saying that if any user wants to refer to a single still image, it better be a screenshot uploaded to imgur through the usual SE image uploading interface.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't remember a timestamp on the video (though I could be mistaken), but yes, if you're referring to a single shot it's better to just screenshot it since I know that I couldn't immediately tell what I was supposed to be looking for in the video. I agree that this advice should probably go somewhere in the help center.


















I asked https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/5105/1651this question using the title "What show is this?"  Being familiar with SE sites, I realized that the title I used is no longer available for future questions.

Given that this community accepts these kinds of questions I can imagine this title being used again.  Perhaps it is a case where titles should be updated to be more specific, but I'm nor sure.  Is there a way that we can bypass the "A question with this title already exists"?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions with the same titleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps try using more descriptive titles in the future? I.e., What show is this that involves (brief description of the characters depicted).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer Kinda what I figured, but for the sake of new users with similar questions I thought I would ask.


















The solution is a more descriptive title.

Think about it this way, if you were looking the show on Google, what would you expect to look for?

For your case, I'd probably do something like:


  From which anime are the characters in this screenshot from?


Or something similar. You can even go as far as describe the characters to some extent (Blue hair, glasses, white and blue cat on the shoulder and a blonde, short girl with a pink cat on her shoulder).

Be specific.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was about to post a similar answer. My suggestion for the title was "What anime is this comparison of releases from?", but anything descriptive enough that it will be easy to find in the future for us and others searching for it is fine.


















Checking the revisions history in any of my questions, I noted that appears when my question was tweeted by @StackAnime, and two things called my atention:   


One of the question appears tweeted two days after I wrote my question,
but another 4 hours after.
https://twitter.com/StackAnime/status/375050200668442624One of the tweets shows exactly the title of my question, but https://twitter.com/StackAnime/status/375684453844398080another
tweet has "Can you answer this?" to the beginning.


All this makes me wonder if is someone who is tweeting the questions(I thought it was just a bot).  

So, if is a human, is more than one? this is gonna be forever or is just gonna be while Anime & Manga is in beta?
In any case, what's the criteria to tweet a question? or all the questions are gonna be tweeted sonner or later?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@StackAnime is a bot or a human being?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know the criteria, but it's definitely a bot. I'm not sure why it was tweeted more than once. As far as I know it's not supposed to do that, and I only see it being tweeted once in the revision history. This could be some sort of bug.


















The @StackAnime account is most definitely a bot. The specific inner workings of the bot has not been publicly disclosed.

According to https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/94593/1288this answer there is a "hotness" algorithm based on views over a certain period of time.  Which is likely to be similar to the algorithm that populates the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/recently active questions page. 

In the same answer, it's been noted that questions have to have a score of >= 1 in order to be tweeted. There seems to be https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/115899/1288another check to avoid tweeting questions that have close votes, unless there is an active a bounty on it.

I’m not able to use any functions that require JavaScript on (meta.)anime.stackexchange.com, i.e.: I can’t vote, can’t comment, the SE notification bar at the top doesn’t work, no hover pop-ups for users/tags, etc.

It works for http://stackexchange.com/users/1739979/unor?tab=accountsall other Stack Exchange sites I use.

I tried it with a different Firefox profile, tried it as guest, cleared cache etc. When I logout and try to vote up a question, nothing happens. If I try this on any other SE site, I get the Thanks for the feedback! pop-up, asking me to login.

In Chromium everything seems to work fine.

I’m using an older Firefox version (20.x) currently (can’t test it with the current version atm). If this should be the reason for the broken JS, then why is this not the case for all other SE sites? Tested it with the current version (23.0.1) on a different OS: same problem there, too.

EDIT: Updates

We only support the last two releases for FF, which is 22 and 23. However, while we don't guarantee it, older versions usually work.

In this case, it's probably something to do with the Hiragana support which is also enabled on Japanese SE - and we can't fix that for unsupported browsers. The best thing to do is just upgrade FF, if you don't want to do that, try a more recent version of another browser.

Still, at least for the time being, the version you're using will probably work on other sites, at least where Hiragana (and possibly MathJax) aren't loaded.

For reference, here's our https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/56161/which-browsers-are-officially-supported-and-what-else-do-i-needlist of supported browsers.

Edit

Reproduced by disabling local storage on FF - escalating to the devs.

This was in fact an issue in the Japanese support user script, which uses local storage to store preferences and does not deal with it being disabled, causing JS to break entirely - even on current browsers. As we strongly recommend but don't require local storage to be enabled, a fix has been pushed that will go out in the next build.

I do not think these questions are good, and that they do deserve downvotes. I object to them on two grounds:


These questions show literally no research effort. 
These questions are almost entirely unhelpful to other people. Images aren't searchable except by reverse image search, so unless someone comes upon the question by reverse-image-searching the exact image that the OP put in the question, they'll never find it.


I'm not asking for them to be closed, of course - they're on topic, and deserve to remain open (in keeping with various SE principles, including the principle that there are no questions "too easy" to be asked). It's just that they're also bad, and so I do think that these questions merit downvotes. 



Note that I am identifying a relatively narrow set of questions as problems here. Other identification questions that are superficially similar but to which I do not object include:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5105/What show is this? (at the time it was posted, all reverse image search results were in Japanese)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5187/What's the character in the poster hanging on the wall supposed to be? (reverse image search returns no relevant results)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5165/Can you help me identify what supernatural anime with white-haired protagonist this is? (non-quotative text descriptions are not generally amenable to search)

I don't think it's fair to say it shows "literally no research effort". As for point 2, the questions are absolutely helpful since they should always detail what's in the image (like on the piyo-piyo apron question). I'll write up a full answer when I get more time later or tomorrow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric If the questions do detail the contents of the image in some useful detail (like the apron question does), I agree that the question is helpful. That didn't cross my mind; very good point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see an image in the third example question (aside from the image in the answer).  The first example is particularly fantastic, and the second one is also good.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DavidStarkey The point I was making about the three questions linked here is that they're good (or at least not bad) identification questions, provided as a contrast.


















I don't see these questions as problematic. I will preface this by saying: If you wish to downvote, that is  your prerogative; the act of voting is anonymous and completely subjective. However, I would discourage downvoting, closing, and other such actions for the following reasons.

Many people do not even know https://support.google.com/images/answer/1325808?hl=enGoogle reverse-image search exists. Unfortunately I don't have any specific polls or stats on this, but I have had many people ask me the origin of a specific image, after which I point them to the reverse search, much to their astonishment. We are an anime and manga site, not a tech site, so we should not assume people to be familiar with anything beyond Google's basic image and text searches.

Additionally, the question itself will contain a lot of searchable, textual details. Let's take the piyo-piyo apron question for example: It contains a title referring to the term "piyo", as well as the apron, and then shows an image. If we then imagine someone, without the image, who searches "anime girl piyo-piyo apron" on Google, they could easily end up on our site. That's a win-win: We get traffic, and our users get an answer.

In essence, I am opposed to viewing reverse-image-searchable questions as "poor" because there is little awareness of Google's reverse-image capabilities, and because having such questions improves our chances of drawing in someone with the same question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would consider downvoting to be valid as there is a lack or research effort (unless of course the asker states they tried a "search by image").  However, your point about people not knowing of the service remains valid.  Giving an answer to their question that points to how you arrived as this answer helps educate the asker as well as answer the question, which ultimately is the most important part.  Additionally, closing is not an acceptable response. A close vote is not a super downvote and this is, for this site, a valid question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with your position as long as the premise that "the question itself will contain a lot of searchable, textual details" is true. I suppose that rather than downvoting, a more productive thing for me to do would be to edit in textual descriptions where they're not present. Thanks for bringing that up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One thing I'd like to add concerning the awareness of Google image search: Google and everything google related is blocked in China. Unless you've got yourself setup with a VPN out of their network, you're left with some less than accurate reverse image search engines like Tineye, SauceNAO, IQDB, etc. I tried a few reverse image searches on some of the questions using those 3 services and they all come back with incorrect results.


















For example, the currently top-voted https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4122/what-manga-is-this-image-with-a-depressed-girl-fromWhat manga is this image with a depressed girl from?. Should we tag that with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watamotewatamote?

The only other StackExchange site I'm aware of that has an analog to our https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request is https://scifi.stackexchange.com/Scifi.SE, with their [story-identification] tag. As per https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/671/should-we-tag-story-identification-questions-with-the-name-of-the-authorthis discussion on their meta, it seems their current position is to not retag once a source is identified. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should [identification-request] questions be tagged with the series of origin once someone figures out what that is?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I'm not misunderstanding the question, this already has an answer [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/450/274).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric You're right; I didn't find that. I'll delete this question now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No need to delete, we love duplicates :) They help us remember how much a topic was discussed, how requested a feature or a FAQ entry, etc. High rep users, vote to close as duplicates (I'm talking to you @Eric) OP and/or low rep users, flagging works just as great.


















Scifi.SE's situation differs from ours somewhat in that their [story-identification] questions almost invariably rely on remembered plot description and other relatively vague things, whereas our https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions often come with a picture, which allows us to unambiguously identify a correct answer. 

I think it would be good to retag with the source if either of the following are true:


The question contains an unambiguously-identifiable image.
The asker accepts an answer (or otherwise indicates that an answer is correct [e.g. by commenting, as some drive-by questioners are wont to do]).

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What would be the point of tagging the question?


















Recently there have been some questions which seem to have been posted intended as quizzes for users here rather than as legitimate questions. This isn't something I can prove, but given the nature and timing of the questions it seems like the answers were actually known to the OP at the time. Moreover, the questions were of the type that were probably not interesting to anyone else, e.g. identification style questions or extremely trivial facts.

I know that it's fine to ask questions that you already know the answer to, though in such cases it's usually good to write your own answer. However, is it still encouraged if the question is not likely to be interesting or useful to anyone else? Put another way, is it appropriate to downvote and/or vote to close questions where the OP clearly already knows the answer and is only posting to test us? It seems to me that all that kind of question does is inflate rep scores and fill our site with random questions that aren't really interesting to anyone.

As a note, even if it is acceptable to take negative actions against such posts, it should probably only be done once one is certain that the question fits this description.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we feel about questions that are basically quizzes?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, if they become a real problem latter like: "Hey, I'm in the 3rd season but I don't recognize this guy" the guy **being the darn MC!!** is to vote down those users until they actually give some trough before asking those kind of... questions? Unless there is some kind of plot behind why one could not recognize him.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have any specific examples?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly The ones that led me to consider this are http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5366/ and http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5363/, but I'm not actually sure whether those fall in this category. I'm more looking to see if there's a general consensus that such questions should/shouldn't be allowed, rather than trying to bring down those specific potential examples.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Trivial questions usually fall into the not enough research was made into them, so yeah, you can downvote in my opinion. I'll give a better answer when I'm next to a PC.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For what it's worth, Scifi doesn't seem too fond of this sort of question: http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/40813/what-place-is-harry-ginny-right-now-in-this-setting#comment77546_40813b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5another sample would be http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5254/who-is-this-anime-girl-character/5279#5279 before it got edited. were it is obvious the person knows this already


















We now have a Kabuto on the main site, who has already resurrected a dozen very old questions, with unhelpful answers. (Those who don't follow Naruto won't get the Edo Tensei reference, sorry about that.) 

From the answers posted, it appears that the said user looks at this site as a discussion board, which it is not. Not targeting the specific user, but what is the right approach to deal with it? 

It is impractical to post a comment on every answer telling them to stop, besides diamond moderators have already deleted a few answers, thus preventing comments (but without commenting why the answer was deleted - or at least I don't see it).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should we do about en masse resurrection of old questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Later this evening (say, 6 hours or so) I'll be on chat, will you be on to provide some more details?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5May not be necessary. I was referring to the answers by user brianahj. Logged in this morning and was surprised to see almost the whole first page filled with Naruto questions. Turns out they are just old questions which got bumped because of new answers by this user.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5PS: Posting *good* answers to old questions is definitely encouraged, but these "answers" were mostly just comments or copied the points from other answers.


















Let the users of the community decide if they're good or bad.

New users might not always know (or take time to read) the rules, but we shouldn't discourage them when they make mistakes. If a new user leaves bad/low quality answers, it's leave a comment explaining why and give them some tips to help them along (e.g. point to the https://anime.stackexchange.com/helphelp page). 

But if it persists despite multiple interventions, a downvote will suffice to send a message.

If the answer is not an answer just flag it for the mods. 

Afterall, we were all new users at one time.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, but when more than a dozen old questions make it to the front page, it pushes other questions down to the next page. Even deleting the "bumping" answer doesn't seem to restore it. Besides, I did not ask for "punishing" the user, just asked how to deal with it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't believe this to be a something that needs much attention. Sure the front page might be full of old naruto questions. But what of it? If someone is tired of naruto questions they can always filter it out using the "add an ignored tag" feature on the sidebar (on the main and question pages). If you're think you're missing out on new questions, you can always make or [feed](http://anime.stackexchange.com/feeds) for it or [sort tagged questions by newest](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=newest).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer It gives the impression that Naruto is the only thing we talk about here to new users. If I saw the front page as an unregistered user as it is right now ([All but one question is Naruto](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a6DME.png)), I probably wouldn't be interested in participating. That isn't to say that there's anything wrong with Naruto, but I don't know anything about it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I understand the sentiment, but no one can deny the fact of Naruto. This is definitely something the community needs to work on... but aside from certain titles, there are not many mainstream or long running popular anime/manga to ask questions about. But I do admit we need to start working on our site image... but the question is how and where to go?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer Why should I filter out a tag and miss all the new questions, just to skip some old questions? Also, what if the user digs out several questions from various different tags? Should I ignore every tag, just because a newbie doesn't know to read the site guidelines before posting? Sure, everyone is a new user at some time, but every new user doesn't start by trolling the site. I certainly did not, and I know dozens of users who did not. You are effectively saying that if someone is driving on the wrong side, then you should ignore them and take another route!


















As of now, we have both /questions/tagged/tagstags and /questions/tagged/taggingtagging as tags on meta, and I don't see any convincing reason to keep both. 

Currently, there are 6 questions tagged with /questions/tagged/taggingtagging, versus 52 tagged with /questions/tagged/tagstags. 4 questions are tagged with both. As such, it would probably be best to make /questions/tagged/tagstags the main tag, and synonymize /questions/tagged/taggingtagging to it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we synonymize [tags] and [tagging] on meta?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm inclined to go with tagging rather than tags, since the questions asked are about the action of tagging, and not about the actual tags mechanism.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha For what it's worth, [MSO has](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/tags/synonyms) "tags" as the main and "tagging" (and a few other things) as synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, wouldn't want to break the streak. :)


















I think that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legend-galactic-heroeslegend-galactic-heroes is the way to go, no matter which synonyms we get for it.
I think people may be most likely to type legend first, when trying to find the tag for this series. As such, this seems like the most reasonable way to go.
Although I feel the same way about partial titles in tags, I think this case would be better of with one.

Also, I do not think https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lotghlotgh should be a tag. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since nobody seems to have any objections to this plan, I've retagged the question to [tag:legend-galactic-heroes]. If you could use your moderatorial powers to add [tag:ginga-eiyuu-densetsu] as a synonym pointing to that, that would be awesome.


















Some questions about games are allowed here. Broadly speaking, anything anime-style is allowed here, which means that games based on anime are allowed, as well as some other closely related types of games such as Visual Novels and some JRPGs. However, we do restrict the questions to be about the story rather than the gameplay of such games. Questions about gameplay of video games (as well as some story-related questions) are on topic on http://gaming.stackexchange.comArqade.  

It's also not clear to me whether fanon games (like the one you posted) are on-topic. This isn't something we've really discussed up until now unless I'm missing something. Assuming I'm not, that's something we'll have to decide, and it's a tricky issue since we do allow questions about things like doujinshi which are also often fanon. My gut feeling is that this probably is off-topic here, but I can see arguments both ways. However, that's probably a topic for a different meta post.

There isn't a separate tag for video game related questions, and I'm not sure it makes sense to make one since we've removed the other medium-specific tags such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/visual-novelvisual-novel and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/moviemovie. You should use the series tag (in this case https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto) and specify in the question which game you're asking about. If the series tag doesn't exist yet, post it anyway with some other tag and make a note for what you think the correct tag is, and someone here will create it for you. Depending on the context, there may be other tags which are relevant (such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise), but none that apply universally.

This is quite old, but I just found it today while going through the flagged posts. I cannot understand what this comment on the flag decline means.



When I saw at this question, it had 4 close votes, so I flagged the question because I honestly felt it should not be closed. I have also mentioned this clearly in my comment along with the reason. 

The reviewer (diamond moderator, I presume) declined my flag and asked me to "vote to close" instead in the future. 

What exactly is this supposed to mean? If I believe that a question should not be closed, then I should vote to close anyway? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What does this flag declined comment mean?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Someone probably misread your flag. Let me check it out for you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the question had 4 VTC and you feel it should be left open, you should go to the review queue and vote to leave it open. If three people (I think) vote for a question to be left open, those votes will go away. Also, I believe that is the only way for the votes to go away (other than the question being closed). Although I can't answer for this flag review in particular, in the future you should do what I described above, rather than flagging the post. Especially because I think not even mods can clear those votes (presuming that is why you flagged it for moderator attention).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Yeah, that makes sense. The response given to the flag decline was confusing. I will do that in future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It isn't a big issue, but I want to point out that close votes review is only available to users with X reputation. While I did have the required X reputation, but at that time, it did not occur to me that I could use the close votes review. Nonetheless, someone without the X reputation won't be able to use this method. (Not complaining about it, this is how the site design works, which in many ways is a good thing.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat The votes only go away after a fairly long period of time, on the order of several days. If the question is already at 4 votes to close, it's probably too late to try to get them to expire. I'd conjecture that it would be more effective to leave a comment or start a meta post related to the closing of the question. Also, mods do have at least one way of clearing close votes on a question, by closing and then reopening it. That's not ideal but I've seen it used in cases like this on other sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM You're right. But that period is reduced once three people vote to leave the question open. See [here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/139836/208518).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Yes, I'm aware of that. However, even with removal from the queue and accelerated aging, I think that questions with 4 close votes are very likely to get a fifth before the first one ages away.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Happy I declined that flag. I guess I probably misread the flag and was confused in why you wanted to flag it. I didn't think there was any need to initiate any action so I declined it. I probably meant to say that you should vote to close/reopen in the future instead of flagging it.


















This question https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/5866/99What happens to Mr 3? contains a minor factual inaccuracy (Mr. 3's ability is wax, not clay). It doesn't affect the core of the question though. The https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/5867/99answer points it out, and then answers the core question. 

From an etiquette perspective, I have two questions:


Is it better to edit the question to remove the inaccuracy, rather than pointing it out in the answer?
What should a third user do in this case? Edit both the question and answer, or just leave it as it is?


Note: I use this question and answer only as an example to illustrate the point. Not nitpicking either of the users. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to deal with minor factual inaccuracy in questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can always leave a comment, and let the OP correct it. Or even if he doesn't correct it, at least people can see your comment with the correct info.


















I came up with a rough idea of some random concepts I threw together. This is more or less just a mock-up montage. Obviously we can't use the images as they're copyrighted content, but they serve as an idea of what could be placed there instead.

Here are two early revisions with color balance testing.

https://i.imgur.com/rGos8aY.png
https://i.imgur.com/FwXNpxs.png

Here is a third version with characters from Uchouten Kazoku in the banner, the lolis and buttons I showed in other answers, and the brush icon that @iKlsR posted, and some color changes. Personally I vastly prefer this revision, because it adds some Japanese culture to the header and makes it a bit more audience-neutral.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEKa2.png

NB: Personally, I like these designs better with a light topbar (https://i.stack.imgur.com/G98pM.pngclicky), but I don't know if we have a say in that.

Fonts


Anime Ace (banner and headers, used in manga scanlations)
WeblySleek UI (body, just used for a simple look)


Images

Colors


I chose blues and greys as a lot of manga and anime sites do the same; MyAnimeList, CrunchyRoll, Daisuki, AnimeNewsNetwork, and others

Badges could be shurikens etc. Definitely some chibi, our mascot should be chibi for the site icon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Needs moar Gundam.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The second one looks pretty good.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Really like the top right one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the bottom concept for main/meta design (full color - main, outline - meta)


















Assuming an anime or manga fan work is reasonably well known, are questions about it allowed?

For example:


http://stefangagne.com/sailornothing/Sailor Nothing
http://yugiohabridged.com/Yu-Gi-Oh! Abridged

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about fan works allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What kind of questions?


















Just tossing this one out there. Here is my proposal for how the badges should look. A final design could be decided on but shuriken are pretty prevalent in anime and could work well.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess, given the number of downvotes on this, it's probably worth clarifying why I did so. Shuriken don't strike me as particularly  anime-related. At best, they're associated with action shows, and at worst with just Naruto. I couldn't say the last time I've seen any in anime, but it's probably been dozens of shows. With that said, I'm not incredibly opposed to it, but for the reasons laid out in [my answer](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/753) I'd rather avoid anything that seems specific to one or another genre.


















I like what https://rpg.stackexchange.com/RPG did with theirs. In particular - 


The guy on the left and the dragon on the right, is a combination of outline and filled
There is a grid background


I think these design elements should be included on the front page since our site also discusses anime and manga production. Perhaps having the scene go from manga-ish from the right to anime-ish to the left.

I came up with a minimalistic banner, it doesn't differ from the current one too much, but I think that'll cause less disruption to the site than a brand new one. It also shouldn't offend anyone too much ^_^

Manga Temple speaks for itself, it's a font that is similar to those that are used in Manga, and are recognisable to be so.

I chose the subtle Sakura/Spring Blossoms as they feature in lots of shows, and not just shoujo.



Alternatively, maybe something could be based off this if it's not prominent enough.

Related to: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/398/99Shouldn't we have just one "retag" tag?
Have a look at: https://anime.stackexchange.com/revisions/5921/1https://anime.stackexchange.com/revisions/5921/1

A new user posted a comment within the question asking for retagging, and chose https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismsymbolism as the tag. Would it be a good idea to have the retag tag visible by default, similar to how discussion, feature-request, support, and bug show up here on meta?

While I agree with Madara's answer there, there is a possibility that a new user who wants to ask question on a series we haven't tagged before, would be confused, especially if they are new to Stack Exchange network as well. 

While they could arbitrarily choose some random tag, it is much cleaner to enable them to use the retag tag more easily.

It seems like more work to maintain than it's worth, considering there are usually people in chat who see every question and can fix wrong tags when an incorrectly tagged question arrives. I'd like for us to be more welcoming to new users with questions about series we don't have tags for, but I'm not sure if this hackjob is the best way to do it, since it's not how tags are supposed to be used.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Uhm, yeah, it doesn't occur quite as often, so the way it currently stands is fine with me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The only problem is that if a new user asks a first question on a "new" series, and sees that their tag is not available, they might mistakenly assume that this site is restricted to certain series only, and leave. I guess it would still make sense to have some kind of a "if you don't know what to do, use this" tag, until the user has 100 reputation. This also ensures that users who get the "free" 100 reputation from other SE sites would be above the threshold.


















What is Nico Nico Douga?

http://www.nicovideo.jp/Nico Nico Douga, a video sharing site from Japan, much like YouTube.

Why embed Nico Nico Douga content?

If you do directly to the video link, it requires you to log in in order to view the video, but if the video is embedded, you can watch the video without logging in.

Why Nico Nico Douga?

A lot of interesting anime/manga/otaku subculture memes (for better or for worse) originated from NND, one of the most notable ones are "Bad Apple!!"

By allowing embedded link access we can possibly allow users to better reference or expand upon the origin of these memes and other subculture references from sources not typically available on via sources like YouTube. E.g., Use better and up-to-date comparisons of MADs from NND for reference to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3916/are-mad-and-amv-synonyms-for-anime-music-videothis question. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow for the ability to embedded Nico Nico Douga videos?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As an addnum, do we want to be able to embed YouTube videos as well? Do we need that one?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I'm in favor of this, I think getting Youtube embedding is a higher priority. Also, unless I'm mistaken, Nico doesn't allow embedding without prior permission, which could be more work to get than it's worth.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't really like embedded video in general. In the particular case of NND, @LoganM is correct to point out that there are technical issues surrounding embedding. A better solution (IMO) is to use [Nicoviewer](http://nicoviewer.net/), which basically allows you to view videos on NND as if you were logged in. (Nicoviewer isn't embeddable either, but it removes the barrier to viewing that exists on NND.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[MMCafe](http://www.mmcafe.com/nico.html) seems to do the same thing and has an English interface (not for the NND embed itself, but for the embedding page).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM When Nico Nico Douga updated their site to version "(9)" they apparently got rid of the annoying restriction of the referral domain to embed their videos with the player.


















The question in question is https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/6021/49this one. It asks for a list (although not explicitly) of anime script writing competitions in Japan, and falls under https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production.  

The question is currently [on-hold] as off-topic, with this reason:  


  "Questions on making your own anime or manga are off-topic as they involve specific expertise outside the scope of this community. See: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/6/49Are Questions about “How to make Anime and Manga” off-topic?"  


However, the question is not quite about making your own anime or manga, but rather about what script writing competitions exist. The reason for questions about making anime/manga being off-topic is that they "involve specific expertise outside the scope of this community". Thus, a question asking for a list of competitions does not fall under this category, since a more knowledgeable/informed member of the community is likely to be able to answer this, with relatively little research.  

Still, the question may be considered off-topic for another reason: it asks for an out-of-universe list. These are generally considered off-topic, as per https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/587/49our latest discussion on that matter. Note, however, that this was considered the general action course on this type of question, and the post states that "exceptions will be made depending on how well-defined the scope of the question is".  

So how should we handle this question?
Should it be left closed as is? or should it be closed for another reason (being an out-of-universe question)?
Or should it be reopened? If so, is the scope well defined enough, or should the question be edited?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this question asking for anime script writing competitions On or Off Topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it's a question about how to make anime, but a question about competitions to create anime. Much like asking what film award competitions are being offered in a country. The OP should probably better define the time frame and scope of this question (e.g. What major prize competitions in anime are/have been offered annually? In Japan? In other countries?). There is a set number of these (along with ones in different categories) that happened in Japan each year, so if we focus on the major ones, the list shouldn't be too bad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer I have the same opinion. Let's see what other people have to say about this.


















I am in agreement with Krazer on this one. I would say this question should be reopened, provided it can be scoped better.
First, this is the close reason given:

Questions on making your own anime or manga are off-topic as they involve specific expertise outside the scope of this community.

This question does not necessarily involve making your own anime or manga. I never intend to be a movie producer, but I still find myself curious about movie awards, film festivals, and indie script writing now and then. The two are related only tangentially, if at all.
However, this question does mention that the OP's intent is to enter these competitions. (This was edited in after the initial close, though.) This should not be included in the question.
Second, I believe this differs from our typical list question issues. In fact, one of the most prominent reasons for disallowing them is the simple issue that https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/588/274you generally need to know about a huge number of anime in order to answer them. That's not an issue here: There are only a finite (and not a large) number of anime script-writing competitions, and an answer really need only cover the major ones. It is possible that the OP wants to know about minor ones as well, but that at least needs to be clarified in the question.
Keep in mind that major carries a different definition for different people, but in this case I think it can generally be agreed upon. That said, here is how I would ask the question; it's brief, but I think it's to the point and still a reasonably acceptable question.

What are the more well-known anime script-writing competitions?
I'm familar with the http://animeka.jp/Animeka anime script-writing competition, but it doesn't seem like there are many others out there. What major or well-known script-writing competitions exist for anime works?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with the wording you propose for the question. +1


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/6028/99This answer (quoted below) was confirmed to be factually incorrect when Naruto Chapter 656 was released.

Actually, issue #1 means first manga release of beginning of the year.
So it means there's no Naruto manga until the first week of January.

I seek clarification on what is our policy on deletion of this answer, because site policy/guidelines on two different pages seem to be mutually conflicting.
The https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/deleted-answersWhy and how are some answers deleted? page states:

Answers that do not fundamentally answer the question may be removed.
This includes answers that are:

commentary on the question or other answers
asking another, different question
“thanks!” or “me too!” responses
exact duplicates of other answers
barely more than a link to an external site
not even a partial answer to the actual question


Although the above answer is incorrect, it doesn't seem to violate any of the bullets. However, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/trusted-userTrusted User Privileges states:

When should I vote to delete an answer?
You may vote to delete answers in the following cases:

The answer is extremely low quality: There is little to no scope for improvement
The answer doesn't answer the question; it may be a comment or a separate question altogether.
The answer is not much more than a link to another page. Link only answers are not allowed on Stack Exchange.


It could be argued that a factually incorrect answer is "extremely low quality with little scope for improvement".
Which of these versions should a trusted user follow when deciding on whether to cast a delete vote on an answer?

I've seen it claimed many times that *moderators* should not delete answers for being factually incorrect, but I can find no information suggesting that the community is supposed to follow the same rule.

No. This would be allowing people to directly give links to illegal sites which provide downloads and fansubs.

Here's the text from the link looper posted above related to deleting answers:


  You should Delete a post
  
  
  If the post is rude or offensive [possibly flag]
  [QUES] If the question has been https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/138686/how-long-should-i-wait-before-deleting-a-closed-questionclosed for a while
  [ANS] If the answer asks another question
  [ANS] If an answer is actually a comment (such as asking for more info, thanks!, etc.) [possibly flag]
  [ANS] If the answer is incomprehensible and you are at least a bit familiar with the subject.
  [ANS] If the answer duplicates another, better answer to the same question (e.g. a link-only answer where another answer provides the same link with an explanation).
  [ANS] Is obvious spam (tries to sell you cheap sunglasses) [possibly flag].
  [ANS] Note that wrong answers should not be deleted: deletion is for answers that “aren't even wrong”.
  


So "just" being wrong is not sufficient to be worthy of deletion if it doesn't have any of the above problems. It does not seem that there is any way for me to remove my deletion vote on that answer, so it'll have to stay there unless there's some way I'm not aware of.

[How does a trusted user remove their delete vote on an answer?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/209433/202356) I am assuming that the OP won't be deleting and undeleting the answer any time soon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Happy Yeah that's what I figured. I'm fine with a mod deleting and undeleting the answer if they want to clear the votes, but I have plenty more deletion votes so it's not particularly important. I'll leave it up to them to decide whether to clear the votes in this case, but I don't think we should set a precedent that mods will do this anytime an answer mistakenly gets a deletion vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I guess there's no great harm done by a few delete votes. If the OP has an issue with it or it accumulates enough delete votes to actually get deleted, then it is appropriate for the mods to intervene. For now though, I think we are done with this.


















In light of certain questions asking about content that may potentially violate the site's content policy on sexually explicit content (aural, written, and visual), should we impose a policy or restriction against these question or disallow them completely? 

I personally don't see any long term advantages in allowing them, but I'm okay iwth it if we try to keep things from being too explicit. The only problem with such a solution is how to educate new user on what is and is not acceptable. The type of enforcement, in the long run, might be more trouble than it's worth.  

Adding a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nsfwnsfw tag seems to be as counter-intuitive, much like the short-lived https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spoilerspoiler. We might be able to use the spoiler tags in some way to cover up the images, but the fact of the matter is that the content still maybe sexually explicit. 

So I ask the community, how do you think we should handle this matter?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we handle potentially NSFW content from questions and answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that even if we do enforce it for visual and linked content we will still need to consider the written content of the question or answer (and any comments associated with either) since they have the potential of becoming explicit as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21/is-dicussing-hentai-allowed ಠ_ಠb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@looper that is about the topic, this is about the content.


















Could be that the NSFW images be hidden in "spoiler" quotes blocks and inform the users that behind there's NSFW content. Is an idea.

Like this:



NSFW:


   here goes your nasty/explicit image/content

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem here lies in that even if the content (assuming that it is potentially explicit) is initially hidden the content still exists on the site, which is still a violation of the content policyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer ah, huh? I was thinking if the content ever gets tolerated... BTW, what about DxD and such... where the thing is too ecchi?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rather than the actual image, I think a link would prove better.  That way the image is never loaded unless you understand the link in the spoiler tag is NSFW and click it.  Perhaps thinking about adding a mature version of the spoiler feature so there is no confusion about what the spoiler means.


















While I am aware this goes into the meta part, I have no priviledges to do so. 


  The suitability of this type of question is up for debate. Until such issues are officially resolved, this question will be locked. At the moment, the current opinion of this type of question involving the identification of adult-orient anime is that it is not suitable on out site, but your opinion and suggestions in the matter are welcome in the meta post mentioned above.


Except I dont have priviledges to chat, comment, or ask or answer at the meta. This question is the only way I can voice any of my opinions.

Because if it's the former, the main problems will lie in the answers, I guess.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user2898 The problem is that StackExchange (the parent company of this site) prohibits sexually explicit material. Personally, I have no problem with it as long as it's clearly labeled NSFW. (and in your case it is since you included "Hentai" in the title) But we need an official response from the StackExchange.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/755/how-should-we-handle-potentially-nsfw-content-from-questions-and-answers


















As far as I know, this site does not have a policy against posting of any sexually explicit content beyond the http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policyStack Exchange content policy, which states that:


  Sexually Explicit Material. Accounts that use Stack Exchange to post sexually explicit or pornographic material, or links to it, will be suspended.


This is rather vague to me. Certainly, pornographic images or links are included, but it's not clear to me that written descriptions of sexually explicit events qualify in all cases. For example, I'd expect a textbook explanation of sexual intercourse would be allowed and on-topic on sites like https://biology.stackexchange.com/biology. Given that SE was willing to create a http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3303/sexualitysexuality site, it's pretty clear that the policy isn't just "any mention of sex is against the rules". Exactly where the line is drawn is up to SE, but I'd assume that we want to be as lenient as possible on this while remaining compliant with the SE global requirements.

On the other hand, we've https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/21/24already discussed whether asking about Hentai is allowed, and the strong consensus was "yes, so long as it is done in a 'scientific' way". While that post is about whether the topic is allowed at all, the answers also suggest a particular policy for policing such content. Specifically, it could be inferred from the answers there that, so long as the question is written with "grown-up" mature language, it should be allowed. We've had a few good questions about hentai series as well. 

So, in my opinion, unless and until we hear back from Stack Exchange directly for clarification on exactly what is covered by the content policy, we should proceed with allowing questions about sexually explicit material so long as the questions themselves are not sexually explicit. Questions which do not have pornographic images/audio/links and which use the most scientific language available when mentioning about sexual events should not be a problem in my view. For what it's worth, that seems to be the policy on https://movies.stackexchange.com/Movies & TV as well as on the failed http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3303/sexualitySexuality site. If a question fails to meet these (and can't be fixed by slight changes in language) it probably qualifies as spam/offensive and I'd think that in most cases having it deleted that way would be preferable to having moderators enforce the policy.



In the interest of users here, it would be good if such posts generally have some sort of indication or warning so that users who do not want to see that content won't accidentally do so. I'm not proposing this as an official policy, but as a strong suggestion to askers. The warning could be in the title or at the top of the question, and could be as simple as e.g. including "hentai" in the title. Use of spoiler markup as suggested in Braiam's answer is also probably a good idea.



For https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6191/hentai-identification-requestthe question which lead to this meta post, in its current form I would say it is allowed, and actually a very good example of exactly how one should ask an ID-request question about a hentai series. The images (in their current form) are censored appropriately. The text uses the terms "fellatio" and "masturbate" rather than more vulgar equivalent slang terms. The title of the question has the word "hentai" which serves as a warning to anyone casually browsing the site. In its current state this should be unlocked. The history should also be wiped since that does contain images with nudity.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Worth keeping the *intent* of such rules in mind... Folks use these sites at work, folks use some of these sites *for* work, and we're not helping anyone by getting them fired - or getting our network de-listed in normal SFW search results. Beyond that, there are probably legal concerns with hosting straight-up *porn*: US law requires to limit the folks *participating* to ages 13+, but we don't have any kind of age-check set up for *viewing*.


















It's pretty safe to define 'explicit' as any content that a normal user of the site would not want to be observed observing. It's content or links to content that you wouldn't want your spouse / children / parents walking in to find you viewing. In other words, it's offensive or embarrasing to the average user of the site.

This is a subjective call, and always will be. If you find that you'd have to explain your browsing habits to someone looking over your shoulder, it probably crosses the line. If images we served in your browser cache could cause you to have to explain your Internet use to your I.T. department at work, we've got a problem.

We also allow anyone over 13 years of age to participate on any of our sites, and that's something that we ask people to keep in mind. 

What I recommend is narrowing the discussion quite a bit. Should we allow questions about hentai, or not? That in and of itself alleviates you from needing to judge this as it's posted. If hentai is off-topic, then surely requests to identify it are also off-topic. Most questions that you get https://anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=hentaidirectly about hentai seem to be identification requests.

You could just as easily allow the topic in general, but close or delete posts that make people feel uncomfortable, or would be likely to do so. However, that puts you in the very awkward position of:


Judging them individually
"Why was this one left but mine closed?"


That may be the way to go if it's worth the added toll of dealing with a few horrible questions every so often. If there's enough good that you can get out of hentai as a community, then just make sure to err on the side of caution when evaluating questions. If you think this might be a little on the inappropriate side, then it probably is, and at least needs editing. 

I don't have enough knowledge of hentai, the culture around it and the appreciation of it as art - so I'm not well equipped to guide you there. Another CM will probably join in on the conversation.

The reason for bringing this up now was a [particular question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6191/hentai-identification-request) which was a bit borderline. Because of that it was decided that we should be more explicit with regards to what sort of content is allowed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I updated my answer. If you feel that there's enough value in the topic to support it by default, then you just need to be diligent in evaluating it. It's hard to define what's _bad_ in this sense, other than _you know it when you see it_.


















I agree mostly with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/759/261Tim Post's post (lol), some things I'd like to point out:

I personally think we should permit:


Discussion, plot (is there plot in that stuff?)
Identification requests


But not allow


Explicit links




First of all, we want to avoid explicit links given our audience. Posting a link to such content is nearly the same as hosting that content here. A spoiler block wouldn't really help much.

However, I don't see a problem with discussion and identification requests (once again, avoiding explicit content links). The only way an user would be stumbling upon any kind of inappropiate material would be by doing an actual Google search for the subject, which is clearly none of our business.



Regarding the usage of a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nsfwnsfw tag, it doesn't seem necessary to me if a question already has the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentaihentai tag.

Sure it might quickly be edited, but say the first user to see it is at work or something.  We don't want to get people in trouble for stuff like this.  In regards to your plot point, some shows are not exactly hentai but can still get quite non-family-friendly.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6224What does the "teehee" expression mean? and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2995/What is the origin of this facial expression with one's tongue sticking out? both involve expressions in which a character's tongue is sticking out, but I don't think the "teehee" question should be regarded as a duplicate of the other one. Should the "teehee" question stay closed as a duplicate of the other one?

The "facial expression" question comes with specific examples, at least one (if not all) of which are parodies of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiya_Co.peko-chan, as Krazer points out. However, I don't think a reference to peko-chan is necessarily something where a character is trying to cover up a mistake they made, which I believe is the expression being asked about in the "teehee" question.

"tehepero" is a word that refers to specifically this latter usage (http://blog.livedoor.jp/seiyumemo/archives/7022095.htmlJapanese source for definition, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJfU4-tVBl4Japanese youtube video of it being used outside of anime). The "teehee" question may even be too much of a "culture" question (see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/610/Where should we draw the line with "culture" questions?) for this site, but if the question stays, I don't think it's a duplicate.

Full disclosure: This issue is complicated by the fact that the tongue of tehepero may have it roots in peko-chan (http://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E3%81%A6%E3%81%B8%E3%81%BA%E3%82%8D(%E3%83%BB%CF%89%3C)Japanese source), and even if it doesn't, it's certainly been associated with her (http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/video/2028230/full/Japanese source 1 http://blog.livedoor.jp/amecome/archives/52045381.htmlJapanese source 2). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are these two tongue-sticking-out questions really duplicates?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alternatively, they're not duplicates because the "teehee" question was just about the English word "teehee", rather than its Japanese cognate "tehe" etc. But of course then it wouldn't be on topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems like I also was a bit to fast with my close vote. I guess the question is more about the laughter/expression Teehee that ussualy accompanies the tongue sticking out trope


















The points you make are good. I was on the fence with this one. I didn't vote to close as a duplicate when I first saw the question, but just linked to the other question. When I later saw it in the review queue, I deliberated quite a bit before deciding to close as a duplicate. I think when I did decide this, I was probably focusing too much on the particular instance from the image, and not enough on the actual question (which is at least nominally quite different from my earlier question).

Anyway, the two tropes are not obviously the same, so the question probably deserves to be reopened for now. The better course of action would be to add an answer linking to the other question and mentioning that the two are related. If others think it is too broad or not anime-based for the question to stay open it could be closed for other reasons, but calling this a duplicate is probably a bit of a stretch.

I've voted to reopen the question.

Update: the question has been reopened

The https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/referencereference tag is, in my opinion, a pox upon Anime.SE. 


One cannot be an expert on "references". However, one can be an expert on some related topics:


Some references are Japan-cultural and can be tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cultureculture; some are puns/etc and can be tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/japanese-languagejapanese-language. Both of these are topics on which we have experts. 
Some references are to other franchises. For these, we have two options. If the asker knows what specific franchise is being referenced, the asker can tag that specific franchise. If not - well, we could tag it with hypothetical https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga tags, but this is an anime/manga site, so those are basically implied.
(Are there any other cases I'm missing?)

This tag is bad for SEO. If it were used consistently in all questions that are about "references", I estimate we would have at least 40 questions with this tag, putting it in the top 8 tags on the site and thus swamping more interesting, franchise-related tags. 
This tag is "http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/meta-tag-like" (https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/403/what-is-the-status-of-meta-tagswhich is bad) - it cannot stand alone (and indeed, does not stand alone on any of the 19 questions in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/referencereference tag so far). 


I think we ought to do away with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/referencereference. Thoughts?

EDIT (Dec 20): Given that there is some support for removing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/referencereference and no opposition, I'm going to start going through the questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/referencereference and eliminating the tag (plus doing whatever other cleanup is necessary) at the rate of 2-3 a day (so as not to swamp the front page).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we want the [reference] tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think I was the one who tried to get this tag to be used more frequently, but I don't really care for it anymore. The original motivation was that reference questions can often be answered even if the answerer doesn't know anything about the source material. In practice though it's not terribly common. If you want to delete it, given that no one has expressed any strong reason for keeping it, I say go ahead.


















In the recent bumps, I have noticed https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2825/titles-where-characters-are-in-trapped-in-a-game#this question as an allowed question.

It seems that it wasn't closed because the scope was reasonably defined. Thus I want to ask, what exactly constitutes reasonably scoped as per https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-sitestatus? Not to mention, the question is perhaps prone to rapid change as well. How can we determine that it isn't?

Going back to the actual question, I honestly don't feel that the number of series that qualify can be considered as a small list. I can probably name a hundred series that will work for the given question, which will easily fill a nice long wiki page.

Regardless of whether this question should actually be closed or not, where exactly is the line drawn for such type questions where it is considered to be reasonably scoped? It seems like reasonably scoped depends on personal opinions and close votes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to determine the status of a list question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We had [a chat](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/417/where-can-i-get-a-transcript-of-the-past-chat-cast-discussions) about this early on when the site first started and we determined that in order to not [sound too strict](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/6697?m=7903169#7903169) we decided to use the words "reasonably scoped." Initially, what we didn't the list to be too long, but we also didn't want to penalize the asker when they don't know whether the list will be long or not, and thus is how this wording came to be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've forgotten some of the history, but it seems to me that this ought to fall under our "list of anime" ban. IIRC that one is more recent than the chat that we had.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I personally like lists, but it is truly unfair when a list requesting for `zombie genre` gets rejected while a list for `in or trapped in a game` gets accepted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It can get closed with a change of scope as too broad and left around. What we should do is prevent the broken window problem.


















I declined this flag. I thought it would be better to leave the progression of comments intact in case other new users were to want to stumble upon this and had similar ideas (e.g. make it a graphic/spreadsheet/comparison chart).

Unless the comment stick out like a sore thumb, I personally believe it is up to the poster on whether or not their comment needs to be removed.

For future reference, if you want a string of comments deleted, please set a custom flag (or ask up in chat) with an explanation, this way it gives us a better context of the events that conspired.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I mentioned in my (now deleted) comment, Stack Exchange doesn't support markdown tables or spreadsheets or anything like that. A graphic seems like a bad idea, especially on a CW post, since it would not be easily editable if anything changes (which it will).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I personally think you should have left your comments just in case some other unknowing user and the same idea. Upvoted comment are given precedence over non upvoted comments when there are more than five.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for your second paragraph, I was under the impression that deleting comments which are no longer relevant without user consent is [standard practice](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19757/184716) on all SE sites in order to reduce noise. As for another user coming up with the same idea, that may happen, but I think the likelihood is not really that high, especially since the post has changed significantly since that suggestion was made and the suggestion to "include features" was essentially implemented, just not in the same format.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyway I'll accept it if the policy on this site is more like "don't flag comments unless they're a serious problem". That's somewhat different than most other SE sites though AFAIK.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You do bring up a fair point about. Personally, I just don't want to alienate any new or infrequent users with the stricter policies other older SE sites have in place (mostly due to their larger user base), since we still relatively new. We've had previous clashes with the literal enforcement of certain policies from other SE sites, when the site started, I don't want to admonish those users for not knowing better. It doesn't hurt to break from the mold at times, but if you feel it is becoming more of an issue that needs to be addressed, then feel free to bring this up at any time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not really for the moment. This is a recreation site, so I'm not as worried about signal to noise ratio and things like that. Really I just flagged because I wanted the hats, otherwise I probably would have turned a blind eye..


















We currently have no tags for anime licensors or streamers (examples of which are Crunchyroll, Aniplex of America, Funimation, Madman, etc.). Would we benefit from adding them?1

I think that the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6266/is-madoka-magica-the-dvd-version-on-crunchyrollIs the version of Madoka Magica on Crunchyroll the DVD version? provides an example of a question which could potentially benefit from a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/crunchyrollcrunchyroll tag. Also, it seems like a hypothetical https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/crunchyrollcrunchyroll tag would meet some criteria for a good tag:


It is possible to be an expert on Crunchyroll (e.g. an avid user or even an employee), and I can imagine some users actively watching the tag (not that it matters right now given our activity level, but, you know, maybe someday)
It can stand alone in some contexts (e.g. questions about Crunchyroll as a service, rather than specific offerings of theirs - but would these be on topic?)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/crunchyrollcrunchyroll would not be a meta-tag - that is, it would describe the content of the question, rather than "something else", whatever that is


However, I could be overlooking some potential downsides to this type of tag. What do you folks think?

EDIT (25 Dec 2013): Absent any opposition to this proposal, I have added the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/crunchyrollcrunchyroll tag to the question mentioned above, and will keep an eye out for other places this type of tag could be relevant.



1 Of course, these tags, if implemented, would only be used on questions that are actually about the licensor or streamer, not just those that happen to tangentially involve a licensor/streamer, e.g. a question like "I just watched X on Daisuki and wanted to know why Y did Z in episode Q" should not be tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/daisukidaisuki.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would tags for anime licensors/streamers be a good idea?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that we've discussed whether questions about how to use external anime/manga sites [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/389/is-it-allowed-to-talk-about-the-use-of-external-sites-such-as-myanimelist/396). Not sure if that should apply to services like crunchyroll which are part of the anime industry though. Anyway IMO it's a pretty good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also think this is a good idea, especially if we can find a way to attract experts or official staff from these services to our site.

Specifically, the tag on the question needs to be first replaced by something else. Then one has to wait for the tag deletion script to run, which happens once per day (typically around 3:00 UTC if I remember correctly). After that you can add the correct tag. I've done this a few times so I know it works. It's an annoying procedure and usually easier just to get a mod to do it here or in chat if there's more than one or two questions.

Lately the quality of some https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions. with no sort of audio-visual artefacts (e.g. an image, video, or sound clip), have been very lacking in quality.

I believe it's time we set some minimum requirements for such questions. We can look at how other SE sites like https://scifi.stackexchange.com/tags/story-identification/infoSciFi and https://movies.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicMovies and TV do it, or be like https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5128/revisiting-the-identify-this-game-banArqade and forbid these "tip of my tongue" question that do not include some sort of audio-visual artefact.

The closing of this https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6703/where-can-i-find-spanish-subtitles-for-dragon-ballWhere can I find spanish subtitles for Dragon Ball legally? question suggests that unofficial subtitles are illegal.

Sure, you can legally produce a translation yourself of a work that you have the right to view.

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27/what-do-we-do-with-questions-about-future-events-releasesQuite awhile ago, I asked the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3372/will-there-be-a-continuation-of-sword-art-onlinehttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3372/will-there-be-a-continuation-of-sword-art-online and recently the answer to this question came available and was wondering:


How should we treat questions that ask about future unannounced events? 
And if allowed, how broad (in terms of timeframe) should we allow these questions to be ?

Lets see if the community's opinions have changed.


















I've noticed that recently we've been seeing a lot of discussion related to changing the tagging structure, which is probably a good thing. However, one point that keeps getting brought up over and over again is that "general tags (anything not a specific series title) will always tend to be the most used and selected for SEO", which is presumably a bad thing. I wonder why we can't change that a bit.



To explain the background to those who aren't active here, there are at least 2 types of common tags here on Anime SE. The majority of all tags are series tags. These refer to a specific anime or manga series. Some examples are https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/death-notedeath-note, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sakamoto-desu-gasakamoto-desu-ga. They are undoubtedly the most useful tags for anyone searching on Google to see in the title. This is rather similar to language tags on Stack Overflow. However, unlike computer languages, of which there are maybe a few dozen languages in common use, there are tens of thousands of series we could feasibly ask about here, and many of them are short enough to only warrant a few questions. It's hard to imagine us ever getting hundreds of non-duplicate questions about, say, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/madoka-magicamadoka-magica, as there just isn't that much content to the series. It's nonetheless an incredibly popular cultural phenomenon which is guaranteed to bring in lots of traffic. The long tail here is quite long, and it's not hard to find examples of questions with thousands of views that have very small tags, e.g. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5484/how-are-white-album-and-white-album-2-relatedHow are White Album and White Album 2 related?

Conversely, we have some tags which are not about an individual series, but are still very useful or necessary for users here. They're not really "meta" tags since they're clearly defined when to be applied and can often work on their own. Hence I'll call them "general tags". https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production is an obvious example of a tag we couldn't do without. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cultureculture and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/japanese-langaugejapanese-langauge are also incredibly useful and important tags for answerers here as they indicate what sort of knowledge and information are needed to answer the question. But these tags can easily get far more questions than all but the largest series. Furthermore, these tags tend to be mostly useful for users here; they don't really contain any words that would trigger hits on search engines. These are analogous to some non-language tags on SO (things like [image] or [math]), but here they're much larger on a relative scale.

An undesirable thing happens when one has a question that uses both tags together. The general tags almost always have more questions than the series tags. Hence they're the ones that are put furthest to the left on the question. Typically, they will get appended to the page title that search engines see instead of the series name. They do little for SEO, so whenever one has such a question it's always a tough decision whether to include the general tag in hope for better answers by existing users or to not include it in hope for better visibility among the broader anime community. That isn't a decision that we should have to make.



Hence, I propose a simple method to alleviate this. Tags should be selectable as "lower priority" (or some similar terminology). For SEO purposes, if a lower priority tag and a normal priority tag are on the same question, the normal one will always be selected first to be appended to the page title regardless of which tag has more questions. Other than that, nothing else needs to function differently. If all the tags on a question are low priority, it will select one of those the same way it usually does.



This could be a mod-only feature. We don't have that many general tags here, and we probably won't get more at an appreciable rate. At most, it'll be a few dozen tags which need to have this set. The positive effect is that it could make hundreds of questions more searchable, especially in more niche areas where we especially need more experts.

note: I suspect there are other sites with similar issues, e.g. https://movies.stackexchange.com/Movies and http://gaming.stackexchange.comGaming. However, I don't know for certain as I'm not that active on these sites. What I do know for certain is that this feature would fix the problem here. Hence I'm proposing this here, but if it's a good idea it could be implemented elsewhere as well.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Low-priority tags for SEOb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wow, Movies & TV has this problem even worse than we do. Of their top 20 tags, only `breaking-bad`, `dark-knight-rises`, `batman`, `game-of-thrones`, and `star-wars` are about a series/product/franchise. Solid feature request; +1.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I +1 this feature request. I'd love this to be escalated to Meta SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin We've been somewhat careful to avoid some of the very broad tags here which are on Movies & TV like [tag:plot-explanation] and [tag:character]. However, I think the problem will only get worse with time, so eventually we may have it as bad as they do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I knew this had come up before. See [this post on meta.Arqade](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/2266/allow-tags-to-be-blacklisted-specifically-from-appearing-in-the-html-page-title) - Grace Note requested basically the same thing, and Jeff said no. Granted, that was two years ago, so it may be worth trying again, especially because most of our tags are demonstrably non-meta. (We could probably do without [tag:symbolism], though...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Part of the fix they used for Arqade seems to be to include 2 tags rather than 1 in the title. That would also probably work here in most cases, but it seems less than optimal to me. Given how long some of our tag names are, we'd run the risk of cutting off part of the question from the visible portion of the title. By contrast, a blacklist or low priority setting wouldn't seem to have any major problems here and would not be too much to maintain.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retag should be on the list of lower tag priority.


















Terminology - This tag should be used in questions regarding terms and their use.

Consider these two questions:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6787/what-does-tsukkomi-meanWhat does tsukkomi mean? and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6793/what-does-canon-mean?noredirect=1#comment7958_6793What does canon mean?.

When I asked what canon means, I actually had no idea of its definition. I see that everyone loves using this term based around anime and manga, and I get the vibe that people use it to describe something as legitimate, but I truly didn't know what it meant (not a troll question).

With that said, my canon question is closed for being off topic, but the tsukkomi question was kept open. In general, both words seem to be associated and used with anime, however, the titled question itself does not pertain to Anime whatsoever.

The only real difference I see between questions is that the tsukkomi question cites a manga description, thus enabling it to be on topic. Otherwise it would be offtopic if it didn't include any anime references and the answer doesn't require any anime references.

In terms of relevancy and usage, I do believe canon is a more common word associated with anime than tsukkomi. Based on that, I would like to think that it can be an on topic question. Perhaps rephrasing the question as What does it mean when an anime is referred to as canon? would make it on topic.

What qualifies as on topic terminology questions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What types of Terminology questions should be accepted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The former is asking about a term used to describe a character in an series (like "tsundere"). However the latter is asking about what a common literary term (like "irony") means. One is in relation to a specific series (examples given), the other is a general definition question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer The titles are pretty much the same. From what I understand, canon can also refer to a character in a series. Thus I can also use canon to describe a specific character from a designated series and it will also be on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's funny because it seems like tsukkomi is an accepted question due to being a Japanese word used in a manga description. If you replaced that with an English word, it immediately becomes off topic. Or if you delete the manga description, it also becomes off topic. If you take the tsukkomi question, and replace every tsukkomi instance with another Japanese (adjective) word, they should all be considered on topic. And this is problematic.


















This seems quite similar to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cultureculture questions, and I think https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/610/where-should-we-draw-the-line-with-culture-questionsthe same rules mostly work here. Terminology questions should be anime-specific, not just anime-inspired. Questions about in-universe terminology are always allowed. What follows is for general terminology questions.

Standard English literary terms and terms which are used to describe fiction generally are off-topic here, as they are never anime-specific. We can generally assume that readers of this site know what terms like "climax" and "character development" mean and questions about these aren't really about anime at all. Such terms are generally covered well by Wikipedia, and sometimes also by other network sites such as https://writers.stackexchange.com/Writers.

Good terminology questions should be about terminology that is mostly/solely used in the context of anime/manga/etc, originated from anime/manga, or means something different in the context of anime/manga than other types of fiction. Some examples of terms which fit this are https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/894/what-does-moe-meanmoe, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4754/where-does-the-term-waifu-come-fromwaifu, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2276/what-are-type-a-and-type-b-viewersType A vs Type B. None of these would be well-known to someone who is not knowledgeable about anime and otaku culture.

There's a grey area when a Japanese term that is used commonly in Japanese culture is also used commonly in anime/manga. Some terms like this are https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6787/what-does-tsukkomi-meantsukkomi and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5831/what-is-an-omakeomake. Neither of these really means something drastically different in the context of anime than in other media. However, these are terms that most non-Japanese viewers would only encounter in the context of anime/manga, so the question may still be useful to anime viewers. In this case, I think we can allow the question on a case-by-case basis if it is likely to be useful for future readers and something that would probably be asked again. Such questions are borderline and it should be decided by the community exactly where the line is.

I don't think there is a set list of criteria which will work in every case like this. One minimum requirement is that it can't be something answerable by a simple translation. So "What does kokoro mean?" isn't going to be acceptable unless the term is being used in a nonstandard way in some work. The term needs to be at least a bit difficult to translate into English in a single word or phrase, so that a simple dictionary check doesn't immediately answer it. It also needs to be at least somewhat common in anime/manga. As I said, this is a grey area, so I'd suggest just using your best judgement.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Grey indeed. If the asker has no idea what a specific word means, then they themselves cannot determine whether it is on or off topic. There are certain words that pertain directly to anime culture whereas other words address Japanese culture in a general sense. There is no way to tell if the question is actually on topic unless you know the word.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@krikara I don't see a problem with that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel that it is unfair to users. There is no consistency with terminology requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@krikara There are plenty of other areas which we haven't yet discussed either and don't have a community consensus on, and no can tell what will happen with those either. I'm not saying that this will forever be a grey area. Just that right now it is, and will remain that way until we get more questions on this line which force us to consider it more seriously.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW I do think the policy I've posted above is what we've been doing fairly consistently. Anime-specific terminology questions are clearly the highest voted questions in the tag, while the borderline ones are sitting with only a couple of votes and sometimes downvotes as well. Your question is the only one I've seen about terminology that's clearly not acceptable by the rules above, and the only one that's currently closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess it just somewhat bothers me that anime-specific questions are widely accepted while anime-general questions are nuked out of orbit. Reason being if I simply just altered my question to make it anime-specific, it could become on topic. Assuming that the tsukkomi question fits the criteria from Help Center, we can use the same template and replace tsukkomi with words like Otaku(geek) or Tanoshii(fun). The question is OT by help center, but then needs to pass OT judgement by users. This is a problem in itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The actual tsukkomi question is pretty general too, only referencing a manga description.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you're getting confused somewhere. Anime-specific terms are obviously fine here, because we're a site about anime. Questions which are not specific to anime in any way are not fine, because we're not a site about everything else. We aren't a site for translating Japanese, for explaining English terms, for teaching you science, or for expanding your cultural understanding of Japan. Only for answering questions about anime. I don't know what you mean by Anime-general (that's an oxymoron), but general questions which are valid in a much larger context than just anime aren't in our scope.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for "tsukkomi", it's a grey area as I said because most English-speaking readers will only know it from anime/manga, and it's not uncommon in anime/manga. By contrast, "tanoshii" is obviously not okay as it's just a translation. "Otaku" is probably okay because it doesn't literally translate to "geek" without losing some context, especially since [otaku themselves are often on-topic](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/524/).


















I had a design idea that I'm still trying to conceptualize. The idea is to treat the main and meta portions for the site each like on side of a two-sided anime storyboard or manga manuscript. The front site (main site) has a more finished product with colors, tones, filled in bubbles, etc, while the opposite side (meta) is much rougher with draft lines unfilled/not typesetted bubbles, and mostly in black and white. 

The main idea is to treat the back and front side is if there it were a like window some what mirroring each other. Sort of like a light and dark world, but instead a colored and non-colored world. For an example if in the colored world we see a person's face, in the non colored world we see the back of their heads, like looking at two-sided of a coin from different angles or a perspective inside a room surrounded by two-way mirrors:



Or front and back covers:

We discussed this before at https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/541/are-anime-physics-questions-a-good-fit-for-our-siteAre "anime-physics" questions a good fit for our site?. There I answered that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics isn't a very good tag in my opinion. This is a followup to that with the intent to either clarify or delete the tag.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics is, in my opinion, very vague. It seems to deal with almost any in-universe mechanics for any series, as well as certain tropes which exist in multiple universes (see e.g. http://www.cs.utah.edu/~duongsaa/more_htm/jk_100animeRules.htmthis page). The https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicstag wiki seems to me to imply it's for this latter category, in which case I think it's entirely covered by https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes, but a lot of the current questions in the tag don't fit that. I don't really know when I'm supposed to apply it. I don't understand why https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6876/why-is-steins-gate-in-the-beta-attractor-fieldWhy is Steins Gate in the Beta Attractor Field? isn't tagged with it, but https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6854/why-do-some-anime-characters-never-grow-oldWhy do some anime characters never grow old? is. 

To me it seems like a meta tag. I can't imagine anyone actually being an expert on anime physics, at least as broadly as it's being defined here. It has all the problems of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-abilitiescharacter-abilities which we removed earlier for much the same reason.

Should we remove this tag? If it is going to stay, what objective criteria can be used to make the tag clear, useful, not a meta tag, and not a duplicate of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is [anime-physics] a tag we should keep?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still agree that questions of this nature [do not need a tag](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/541/are-anime-physics-questions-a-good-fit-for-our-site#comment1031_542). +1 for removing it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First of all, I as an OP of question [Why do some anime characters never grow old?](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6854/why-do-some-anime-characters-never-grow-old) didn't tag my question with anime physic, but actually I quite like this tag, some question and answer seems good to me but the other has too much speculation and opinion. Maybe we can change it to something better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ShinobuOshino To be clear, we're not talking about removing the ability to ask questions related to anime physics. We're talking about the tag itself, which would not affect any existing questions. (That is, no existing questions have *only* that tag.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The consensus seems to be to remove the tag. I'll be removing it from a few questions at a time until it's gone, to avoid flooding the main page.


















As of now, the question that shows up on https://anime.stackexchange.com/abouthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/about is this one: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/what-are-the-added-values-of-ecchi-to-a-seriesWhat are the added values of ecchi to a series?. This is an alright question, but I don't know that it necessarily is the question we would want to be the "face" of the site, so to speak. 

Do you suppose it might be better to change that question to something more mainstream, like a question on Naruto or FMA or a trope or something? (I recall reading somewhere that mods have the ability to change which question that shows up there; if not, never mind this.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we change the question that shows up in /about?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can only change the introduction part above the "Ask questions, get answers, no distractions" part.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer You obviously know better than I do, but [this post by a mod on CSTheory](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2676/suggestions-for-our-about-page) claims that mods can edit the question that is displayed. Or is that because they're graduated and we aren't or something?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My bad. I just noticed that option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The current available options are the ecchi one and the [DBGT](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/361/was-dragon-ball-gt-made-by-fans) one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For reference, the criteria for a question to be available are [here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/163947/what-determines-the-questions-available-for-selection-in-the-about-page). Basically, it needs to be short and have at least 2 short answers, one of which is accepted. Also no "crazy formatting".


















I can see reasons for removing as well as for keeping.  If it were up to me, I see no harm in keeping the tag.  Given Logan's comment, removing is probably the better option.

Reasons to Keep


Users that like questions about a certain anime, but do not like questions that would fall under the "anime-physics" realm can easily ignore those ones.
Users that like thinking about the mechanics behind things could enjoy these questions, regardless of where they come from (and maybe even find some new anime/manga in the process)


Reasons to Remove


Many of these questions are within the realm of their respective series, so just the anime/manga name should be sufficient
Those that go beyond one show fall under the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes
When used with a tag of lesser popularity, this tag will take over and be appended to the title


I also want to discuss the claim that having an anime-physics expert is unlikely.  While it is unlikely that any user could be an expert on all  https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics, it is also unlikely for a user to be an expert on all https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request.  Of the three, I think anime-physics is probably the most likely to master.  After all, the question is asking how a mechanic could work using the known laws of physics while also including any sorts of special cases (i.e. magic)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The biggest current reason to remove it IMO is one that you've missed. Currently the tag has 14 questions, which makes it around the 30th largest tag. When it is used in conjunction with a smaller series tag, "anime-physics" will be appended to the page title rather than the name of the series, which means the page will not show up in most search results. There's already several examples of this, e.g. http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/how-is-misakas-railgun-so-destructive. This is a problem with all general tags, so we need to make sure the ones we do have are actually useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did not know that.  Updated the answer, but I think removal is probably the better option.  Is there a reason why the system would not pick the first tag listed instead?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags are ordered by frequency. I think the method was designed for SO and works there because there are a few big language tags which are the useful ones. It doesn't work as well here because our general tags are bigger than our series tags in some cases. I've [put in a feature request](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/803/low-priority-tags-for-seo) which would alleviate that, but the chances of it happening are low.


















Quite frankly, I have no idea what "anime physics" even is. Unless someone can provide a good definition of what things are and are not covered by the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics tag, the lack of a solid definition for the topic is reason enough to do away with it. 



Regarding David Starkey's discussion of being an expert on various things (which I would comment on, but this is a bit long for a comment):


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request - you're right, one cannot be an expert on "identification requests". As long as we allow questions on the topic, though, we kind of have no choice but to allow this tag as an exception.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes - I think one can, in fact, be an expert on "tropes". This expertise comes from wide-ranging experience consuming anime and related media, and understanding what commonalities exist in many different anime, and why they exist. This is, admittedly, a bit difficult to characterize, but I think we can agree that somebody who has watched a lot of anime understands why the protagonist sits in the back row by the window, or what the "anime sweatdrop" means, or whatnot. 
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics - until I know what this actually means, I have no idea whether or not one can be an expert on it.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with the point you make on tropes.  As for anime-physics, I could be wrong but I would define it like this: "explanations of how a particular mechanic/system works inside the anime world using real-world science when possible".  Example could be something like "How much energy is in a Kamehameha attack", to which the answer could draw from formulas in real-world physics relating to things like crater sizes and what-not.


















I would suggest the following wording instead:


  Questions about speculative events with regard to anime or manga production are off-topic.


I could throw why we don't accept them in the close reason but at 12am I wouldn't trust myself. BTW, links to resources explaining why or where they can get their information is useful, so users doesn't get all bitter on us.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed - pointers to major anime news sources (for sure, [ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/); what else?) would be a very good thing to have.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin: If you agree, vote it up :) It's easier to sum up meta support as question/answer scores.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Madara Oops, I thought I did.


















Can we get a close reason for recommendations and/or list questions? These seem to be coming up more frequently so a custom close reason would be great. Something like (I wrote this in 30 seconds so it could use tweaking):


  This question is off-topic because [list questions are considered not a good fit for our site]. However, once you have https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7237/how-does-reputation-work20 reputation you can stop by http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/our chatroom and ask some of our community members.


The braced part could link to a meta thread such as https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/470/274this one but I leave that up to discussion/moderator consensus.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A close reason for recommendations and lists?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are "too broad" and "primarily opinion based" not good enough? IMO either of those is fine for most of these questions, and a link to the help center can be given in the comments fairly quickly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM In some cases I don't think they're specific enough. They seem misleading (IMO) in the sense that a "too broad" list question might beg for a more narrowly defined list question; "primarily opinion-based" on recommendations is likely fine, though a custom close reason is just more informative.


















Tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology is only used on 4 questions. In the few questions it is used, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production is a better fit.

We're already having https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/808/is-anime-physics-a-tag-we-should-keepa similar discussion about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The [technology] tag seems a bad ideab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now there's only 1 question tagged and it's off-topic about visual novel game development reverse-engineering :\


















Here are the four questions that currently bear the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology tag:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/313/gilgameshs-ancient-fighter-planeHow does Gilgamesh have a futuristic fighter plane? - on this question, the use of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology is very much like the now-proscribed use of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-physicsanime-physics. As such, I have taken the liberty of removing it.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/28/how-do-you-extract-texts-into-a-text-format-that-you-can-copy-and-paste-from-visHow do you extract texts into a text format that you can copy and paste from visual novels? - this question is about technology that specifically affects the anime-consuming experience (or, in this case, the VN experience). There are no other tags that could go on this question as it currently stands. The only tag that might fit is "visual-novel", but that tag does not and should not exist, so I'm not really sure what to do about this. 
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5355/what-did-the-c-control-production-use-for-their-cel-shadingWhat did the [C]: Control production use for their cel-shading? - as you point out, this use of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology is subsumed by https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production.  
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7265/animes-and-mangas-about-cold-warhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7265/animes-and-mangas-about-cold-war - this was a bad question (a recommendation request), has been closed, and will eventually be deleted, so there's nothing to worry about there. 




The two valid questions with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology (the second and third) fall into two categories - technology used by the anime consumer, and technology used by the anime producer. 

For the latter, I think it is clear that we should just go ahead and tag it with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production. I don't see any benefit to having tags for things that are strict subsets of "anime production", because I find it vanishingly unlikely that we will ever have people here who are experts on anime production technology but not the rest of anime prodution. 

For questions about technology used by the anime consumer, though, I can see some merit to the tag, if such questions are considered on-topic. Judging from the closure of the question, though, I guess the verdict was that these questions were not, in fact, on topic.1 This being the case, we basically have two options: either go around actively killing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/technologytechnology every time someone uses it (and sticking a big "DO NOT USE THIS TAG" notice in the wiki), or finding a better tag for this question (but as I noted above, there probably isn't a better tag).

1 I do not agree with this and will probably make a meta post on the topic at some point.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's worth pointing out that the VN question was during the private beta period, and was fairly contentious then (see http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11/are-questions-about-technical-aspects-of-visual-novels-on-topic). It's probably worth considering again what to do with these sorts of questions.


















According to the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commentComment privileges page, only after gaining 50 reputation can a user comment everywhere(on posts by other users).


  Comment Everywhere
  Privilege Type: Communication Privilege
  Awarded At: 50 Reputation


It is known that a user with even 1 reputation can comment on their own posts but cannot do so on posts by other users but seeing this https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5765/is-dracule-mihawk-really-the-strongest-swordsman/5767#comment8803_5765particular comment has raised issues on this feature. How can https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/3679/user3679a user with just 1 reputation comment on a question which was not posted by them? It mostly seems like a bug unless there was a change in the Communication Privilege feature.

FYR, this is that comment(in case it gets deleted later).

Then if your points in that another site is **revoked**, you still has the bonus 100 points **BUT** others see it as just 1 (if you don't have any other points aside from the bonus ) you still have the privilege as a 100 point user and you would be shown with 1 reputation. has anyone experienced this?


















This is /questions/tagged/status-bydesignstatus-bydesign, and no, the user doesn't have the ability to comment everywhere yet. 

♦ moderators have the ability to convert answers to comments. It happens fairly frequently here that new users who don't understand our policies will post answers which do not answer the question. When these answers are flagged as "Not an Answer" or if a moderator sees them before they're flagged, they'll delete them, but if the post makes sense as a comment the moderators will sometimes choose to convert it. That's what happened here, and as far as I know the only way that a <50 rep user can comment in places other than their own questions/answers and answers to their questions.

Here's a screenshot of what the deleted answer looks like for someone with the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-toolsmoderator tools privilege (currently at 2k rep):



As a note, this user still can't post more comments on that post (as far as I know). If you try to respond to them, they can't talk back.

We just got https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7572/will-there-be-a-second-season-of-rwbya question on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rwbyrwby (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBYWikipedia). Is RWBY on-topic? 

Relevant facts:


RWBY is not anime, because it is not Japanese.
RWBY is (or claims to be?) inspired by and/or patterned after anime.
We accept questions on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avataravatar, which seems similar to RWBY as far as "anime-ness" goes. 
There was an old https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/is-animation-or-comics-inspired-by-japanese-culture-or-styles-considered-on-topimeta thread on this topic. It is not authoritative, but it does contain some opinions that may be of interest.
There was also a more recent https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/415/should-we-expand-our-scopemeta thread that has a very good breakdown of the issue by LoganM. 


Having never seen RWBY, I have no opinion on this matter myself.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is RWBY on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A more recent meta discussion which is relevant: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/415/should-we-expand-our-scope. I don't know if RWBY fits the criteria in my answer (I'd never heard of it before today) but that's what we should base the decision on IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`RWBY is not anime, because it is not Japanese.` this should be an invalid argument, if you translate anime it becomes cartoon, there should be no limitation in that regards. Anime is not Japanese animation or at least to Japanese people its simple animation or cartoon as it would be called in the US.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Prix Now that's just silly. Are you arguing that Spongebob Squarepants should be on-topic here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a huge difference between being silly and wording something completely wrong and yet trying to make it feel right and technically speaking yes it should be open to any cartoon, there is a difference between Japanese animations yes but there is quite a list of nice animations made else where as well and its no like people will start posting about Tom & Jerry or Mikey Mouse and even if they did or do I don't see a single problem with that, after all it will be achieving its goal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Prix I suppose if that's your opinion, that's fine, but I'm pretty sure you will find _huge_ opposition to the idea of allowing questions about all cartoons irrespective of their origin. That just isn't what this site was created for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then the first thing that should change is the name and goals, either way it will be down in a few months. Like it or not your statements still stands wrong `RWBY is not anime, because it is not Japanese.` you should at least change to `RWBY was not made in japan, should we consider it off topic?` or something alike.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Prix, your argument is relativist, and therefore fallacious. You have to draw the line (get it?) somewhere and you can't be all-inclusive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NobleUplift yep I may be, however the wording `RWBY is not anime, because it is not Japanese.` is not right, regardless.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I definitely have to say RWBY is an anime whether anyone likes it or not. Anime is just another word for cartoons. there's are some differences, but really not that much.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This discussion should be carried out on the meta that @LoganM linked, not here. This particular topic is about whether or not RWBY fits our existing criteria. If anyone wants to discuss what those criteria *should* be, please post on the relevant topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Prix I think whether RWBY is anime or not is not a grey area, or an opinion. Almost all definitions of the word anime that I've seen boil down to basically "cartoon made in Japan" http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anime In Japan, they might call all cartoons anime, but in English that isn't the meaning. Some cartoons might be in the spirit of anime, and even indistinguishable from anime unless you knew otherwise, but they still wouldn't be anime.


















I think it should be counted as on topic. 

Right now we are also accepting close to manga things such as Manwha/ Korean web strips.

I think anime like and anime inspired series should be allowed aswell.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This isn't a question about whether or not anime-like or anime-inspired is allowed or not, but more of does RWBY count as anime-like or anime-inspired. Just cuz wiki says they're anime-inspired doesn't mean its true.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ton.yeung I would say yes. Even though it is not fully anime-ish I think the anime style is still dominant in the series and should be counted as anime inspired


















Option A': Implement more stringent quality control on these questions primarily with downvotes, not close votes.

Yes, we need some quality control on this front. However, the intended way to deal with a poor question on SE sites is downvotes. Close votes should be reserved for questions that just won't work in our format, not ones that are probably answerable but low quality. I wrote https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/792/24an expansive answer explaining the difference on a related question and when to do what.

This may seem contradictory to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/437/downvoting-new-users-whose-questions-dont-meet-our-criteriaDownvoting new users whose questions don't meet our criteria, but it's really a different issue. That was a case of a decent question that needed to be closed because it's off topic and not something we cover, but didn't need to be heavily downvoted since it wasn't unclear or low-effort and the policy was (at the time) fairly obscure. Bad ID requests are on topic and answerable, but low quality/effort. They should be downvoted but not typically closed unless they fail some other criterion for closing.



For this to work, we actually have to have users willing to downvote stuff. That seems like a limiting factor right now for whatever reason, but I'd encourage everyone to be more liberal with downvotes when you think they're justified (not just in the case of ID requests). I've seen many questions and answers that I considered poor despite many upvotes. Starting now, I intend to downvote these whenever I see them, not just when I consider it to be obviously wrong or problematic. 

We also need me (or someone else willing) to write some sort of /questions/tagged/faqfaq for new users who want to understand how to ask a good ID request. I've been planning on doing this for a while (as my linked answer above says), but I've lost one nearly complete draft and some other stuff came up that diverted my attention. I will hopefully be able to do it this weekend, but if someone else wants to take it off my hands then feel free to offer.

Downvoting a questions doesn't subtract from your rep like down voting an answer does. The function is there to weed out bad question and answers. It's sometimes that one sentence that invalidates the question or answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer some questions obviously scope the problem which is very helpful - http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7517/i-cant-remember-this-animes-name - says its from Netflix so it's got a reasonable chance of people knowing what it is. But for http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7320/what-is-the-anime-title-of-this on the other hand, I don't know if that description is enough to go on for someone who could research and/or ID it and I'd be inbetween ignoring and downvoting it. (That might just be me though :P )


















I think the fact that it's in the anime section of Crunchyroll and is anime-styled, like Avatar means that it should on topic. 

If you didn't know it was an American production, it'd be a pretty safe guess to say it'd originate from Japan, whereas many other Western animations are easier separated visually.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think "it's in the anime section of Crunchyroll and is anime-styled, like Avatar means that it should on topic" is a definitive guideline... They're a business, its in their interest to reach as wide an audience as possible. We're a special interest group, which means we need to be a bit more selective to stay relevant. It *is* however, IMO, a valid and relevant point.


















When you select to flag a question to be closed as off-topic there is 3 options which seem to have been added for the site with the other 2 looking like the generic options that all Stack Exchange sites have.

Now when a Recommendation List request question comes up and we select to close it it would be good if we could have a "Recommendation List" option there and if it works how i think it does, the comment that's automatically posted should also detail that it's off-topic but also indicate that with 20 Rep the question could be asked in the Chat Room.

I see 3 benefits to this


for people like me who post a comment first about it being off topic before clicking on "close" it would save up on the double comment
The OP would be notified about the comment to their question, reading it they may have work to get the 20 rep needed to enter the chat room, this could lead to more new users staying longer
For Mods who can close a question by themselves, it would look more welcoming to a new user to see this rather than a This question does not appear to be about anime or manga within the scope defined in the which we get when use the "other" option


NOTE: i should point out that i ask this based off my understanding on how the closing works and is subject to be completely wrong
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we add a "Recommendation List" to the list of off topic close flags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We already have 3, which as I understand is the max for most sites. We'll need to remove one to add this. Not that I'm opposed to that (the "Creating your own anime/manga" one has basically never come up since it was added so that would be a decent choice), but it's something to think about. For now though, linking to http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic in a comment (which explicitly mentions recommendations as off-topic) is probably sufficient.


















One question per question please. That's the policy everywhere, that's the policy here as well.

If you encounter this, I propose editing to remove all other questions, and leaving a comment for OP to ask his extra questions one at a time.

We need to stretch the line somewhere, this is it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I assume this can be handled by requesting the OP edit the question, and if not simply closing it as too broad? As in, should we be editing the post ourselves?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric: I'll expand my answer. I propose editing to remove all other questions, and leaving a comment for OP to ask his extra questions one at a time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, we should also let the OP know that he can see his original post via the edit link. I know *I* didn't know how to see edits when I first started.


















I just asked a very subjective question about Evangelion (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7722/is-the-evangelion-remake-a-remake-or-a-sequelIs the Evangelion Remake a remake or a sequel?) to with I really want only opinions and not really a concrete answer. So I would have liked to add a discussion tag to indicate this. Why doesn't Anime & Manga manga have one? I know from personal expience that a lot of questions about anime are more oppinions than factual question with factual answers. 

And maybe it is just me, but a cold Q&A like SO would be kinda dull. There are times when you simply want and oppinion and there are times when you want an answer. Especially for something like Anime and Manga. Taking into considerations the reaction to this question (https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/145/should-we-explicitly-allow-discussionsShould we explicitly allow discussions?) I think it would be well worth it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should there be a Discussion tag in Anime & Manga?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why did this question get three downvotes?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MiharuDante Meta works kinda differently from normal Q&A, this is simply to indicate that the feature-request was shot down.


















Well, there are different channels for you to take then. This isn't a forum, and as such, isn't fit well for a discussion.

If you have enough rep (Which you do) you can always join us in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697chat for discussions and whatnot.

If you don't want to use chat, then sadly Anime & Manga Stack Exchange isn't the place to ask your subjective questions. :(
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I get it that this is more of a Q&A and hell if I would allow something like this in SO, but with my own question for example I would love to have mark of the responses to refrence and point to. (Chats do not have this.) And is it really that bad for Anime & Manga to become more of a forum than a Q&A?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@idra: First off, chat *does* have bookmarked conversation and stars. You can use the in your advantage. Second, it's not about being bad or good. This is the type of site it is.


















For the inevitable launch of our site community we need to come up with a mascot design to help us promote ourselves. 

To the community, I'd like to ask you to share your ideas on what kind of mascot would best promote and represent and promote community.

They can be just about anything, lolis, chibis, robots, animals, ships, etc. Be creative and try you best at creating a new, original concept. It doesn't matter if you can draw or not, even a description is fine. 

Please try to follow this format when proposing an mascot:


  Name: (What is the name of your Mascot)
  
  Description: (Description of the mascot, provide any background behind you character and/or why you chose to create them)
  
  Charm Point: (What is the "trademarked" aspect of them that sets them apart? It can be a pose a catchphrase, an special action/attack pose, or something else all together)
  
  (Anything else you wish to include. E.g., Hobbies, blood-type, extended family, favorite food, favorite anime/manga, whatever idols do, etc.)


The top voted mascot suggestion may be commissioned into a work for the our site launch. 

Try to keep things safe for work and do your best for the future of our community!

I'm looking forward to what everyone has to offer! 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5SOS! The Great Anime.SE Mascot Idol Search!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I thought we already had Sakamoto, the fire-breathing walrus...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe we should have periodically changing mascots. For a lot of the fansub sites, I enjoy seeing a different banner and mascot on every refresh.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mysticial that would not be very maintainable in the long run. Once we decide on a character, maybe we can use different "versions" of it for promotion purpose.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5while I'm thinking about moe character, I think it's a good to choose a character that related with Q&A such as detective character for example like [Conan](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KRCdnZ_7ou4/UfX4Ar4RAXI/AAAAAAAAkr0/pw7MOYiGbRE/s1600/150510-detective-conan-conan-cover.jpg)... But it's just my opinion...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we really be coming up with full character proposals? I have a few ideas for points or aspects of a character, but I definitely couldn't flesh them out into a full character, and I'm not sure that would be the most useful thing anyway for @Jin and whoever ends up designing the character.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a side suggestion, I think that once we have our mascot, we should rename and re-avatar the Community bot to w/e we chose. Give them a bit more purpose/presence/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMO we should have multiple bot characters different from site's mascot, each with their own personality and active in different times of the day. Would feel like there's a lively gang working in the HQ.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds like a good idea. I'm guessing it has to be original.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm a little bit confused as to why we even _need_ a mascot in the first place. Do any other SE sites have one? And if we do need a mascot, why does the mascot need a "description" or a "charm point"? Surely the mascot will just be part of the imagery that shows up in the site's design?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Each site represents a certain community with special needs, catering to which could greatly improve overall user experience and the site's value. For example, mathematically-themed SE sites have cool formula markdown, and the UX site has a really great interface, as expected from UX fans. Personally, I don't know of a popular anime and manga themed community that doesn't have a mascot. It only seems natural to have one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1306322 [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/), [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/), /a/, [/r/anime](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime), [AniDB](http://anidb.net/), [MangaUpdates](http://www.mangaupdates.com/), and [AnimeNewsNetwork](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/) all lack mascots AFAIK (granted, some of these may not meet your definition of "community"). Can you give some examples of anime-themed communities that do have mascots? Because I wasn't aware that was really a thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In any case, if we are going to have a mascot, I still don't see why we need anything besides visual features like "red hair" or whatever. All of the answers so far have some sort of elaborate life story for the mascot characters, which strikes me as really excessive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess we just need to come up with a better list requirements for the mascot then, with reasons explained for each requirement.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If Appearance is kept then Personality should be aswell since explaining one's personality will help in how the character is drawn particularly with facial expressionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we might need to take a step back and research more what site mascots are all about and come up with a more detailed set of requirements. AND get more attention from active users somehow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For example, maybe create a huge list of various character traits, vote on them and select from the most prominent ones. Try different combos, see what looks appropriate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, this hasn't got anywhere. I'm sure if we ask some people on SE outside A&M they'll at least give us a hint on how to go about creating a mascot char for a site.


















Name: Ai-chan 

Description: Highschool detective. Carries a magnifying glass wherever she goes and determined to find out answers to all of Anime & Manga Stack Exchange's questions! 

Having moved on from simple highschool mysteries, Ai now works as professional sleuth and tries to solve all of A&M's puzzling questions. She's still a highschool student though, so she mightn't get all of them ^^;

Raggedy hazelnut hair and wears a pale blue sailor fuku uniform (could have a summer version also). 

 

When she's not solving mysteries, you can find Ai unwinding with a good light novel/manga on the sofa.

Charm Point: Very enthusiastic about finding answers and always tries her hardest. She gets very upset when she can't find an answer to a question (it's cute though).  

When stuck on a particularly hard mystery, Ai scrunches her face up in intense consentration until she has a vivid realisation. I can imagine an exclamation mark over her head when she finds a solution

Blood Type: A

Age: 17

Star Sign: Gemini

Favourite Anime/Manga: Lupin III

Seiko-chan (惺子), 18 years old, high-school student. (name roughly means "sincere child")

She's knowledgeable, kind, honest, helping and straightforward. And good-looking, of course.

Seiko-chan represents the greatness of StackExchange community, and, in their turn, users are inspired to become great like her.

She loves experiencing various emotions the world of anime and manga can offer through inspiring adventures, fantasy, dramas; alluring romance, ero-manga; light-hearted comedy, slice of life; more serious seinen and josei, sci-fi, sports, and whatnot.

Seiko-chan's favorite drink is tea. Different kinds of tea, which perfectly fit the mood and allow for best entertainment experience.

She also enjoys cosplay and has some friends who share her infatuations.

Anime and manga just happen to be one of her main interests in entertainment. And so this is for many users, so don't forget to join http://chat.stackexchange.com/the Chat for some on- and off-topic discussion!



[end of cool part]

Forgive me if I messed up with the Japanese, for I am lvl 1 in it.

If anything, I'd go with Shaft's art style for realistic proportions, attractive body figure and serious, yet adventurous feeling. Along the lines of Hanekawa Tsubasa of Monogatari series.

I imagine it would be pretty awesome to have a random rotation of header backgrounds of Seiko-chan with various cups of tea, reading some manga or watching anime, if anyone is up to the task of drawing them.

Seiko-chan's friends could partake in her cosplay parties, parodying famous scenes and characters in the site's header and footer.

I'm opposed to cliche mascot characters with standard trademark elements, and StackExchange deserves much better. Which is why I thought of the above. Feel free to be inspired by this thought, and create your own unique proposition worthy of this site.

Name: Sakamoto (Type Unicorn)

Description: Sakamoto is one of the the most charming unicorn you will ever see. While our site has meidos and lolis (also waifus), there's severe lack of unicorns. Unicorns have been a popular subject across many SE sites and SE meta memes. 

Sakamoto is the gear that makes things turn, he digs through old questions and bumps up unanswered questions that have been buried under the sands of time. He sifts through the flags and delivers them to the moderators. He keeps tally on upvotes and downvotes. He the one responsible to compiling organizing the review queues, writing the labels to the tags and making sure the feeds arrive on time! He gives it his all so visitors from around the world can have a good time on this site! He's the one that gets things done behind the scenes!



Design not final. May be subject to change. In case you are wondering where the original archetype comes from, this is the http://genesis-horizon.wikia.com/wiki/Unicornunicorn from 'The Horizon In the Middle of Nowhere' series. (I have yet to figure out an original design for him, so this serves as a placeholder for now.)

Charm Point: Sakamoto's charm lies in this simple, nondescript design. There's enough detail for a shape, but not too much detail to bog him down. This makes him easy to draw and  be reproduced by others. His uses his magical horn (which doubles as a drill, a "giga-drill") to get things done around the site since he technically has no hands. While it doesn't seem like it, Sakamoto can actually fly thanks to his magical tail, which is actually a harisen.

He's round like http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/10/meet-bubbles/Bubbles, the official SE mascot, but he's not flat, instead he's like fluffy and soft to touch, like a dango. He has little-bitty feet that go "clop-clop-clop" as he walks. His cute little eyes and button nose can disarm even the most unloving brutes. If he was a http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/ServantServant That cute radiant blush of his up his Charisma to A Rank (Saber only has Charisma that is B Rank) and light even the darkest of places.

Blood Type: O

Birthday: Dec. 11, 2012 (12/11/12)

Hobbies: Organizing the logistics of Anime.SE, spotlighting old questions so they can get answers, delivering bounties that have been awarded, handing out badges to helpful users, delivering notifications, delivering feeds to the chat rooms, and much much more~

tl;dr: This site needs more unicorns.

It's been announced that this site will graduate. That's great news and it's a testament to the hard work that our community has put into maintaining quality content, especially given how this site could have turned out. Looking at the http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/31538/anime-mangaArea 51 metrics, all the numbers are pretty good. While there are still areas we could stand to improve on, none of them are serious issues. However, there is one thing that bothers me about our graduation, which is a number that's pretty easy to overlook:



We currently have only 16 users with over 3k rep. While that's more than 3 times the "excellent" level criterion, I still think it's too low for a graduated site. It's not a problem now, because most of the important privileges are way lower than that. But once we graduate, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questionsClose/Reopen Vote Privilege will be raised to 3k rep. That means that there will only be 16 users on the site with that privilege. Currently, by contrast, there are 73.

16 seems rather low to me. If you include the moderators (I expect we'll continue to have at least 3), that would be only 13 regular users to cast nonbinding votes. Of those 13 users, 3 haven't been seen in the past week (some longer than that). That's not a huge problem, but we can't count on them to be regularly voting on these things. So realistically, there'll be something like 10 users who can cast nonbinding close votes. We'll still need 5 votes to do anything though. So basically, except in the very obvious cases (which mods can handle on their own anyway), it will be quite difficult to close anything without a strong consensus. Practically speaking, it may just happen that mods start closing things once they get 2-3 other close votes, but I'd rather let the community handle this as much as possible and reserve moderator intervention for the exceptional cases.

It's not clear to me that the transition from 73 close voters to 16 will be a smooth one. It could create problems for us at least until we get more 3k users. I don't know how long that will be, but I expect it would at least be a few months, if not longer. It would also mean that even a single user at this level leaving the site would have a noticeable effect.

For comparison, of the http://area51.stackexchange.com/?tab=launched10 most recent graduated sites, only the oldest 3 had fewer than 30 users at this level when they graduated. The average was 33.8 at the time of graduation (more than twice ours), and the lowest was 23. We'd be far below any of those if we graduated today. Admittedly, we aren't graduating today, but I think we should consider this on the premise that we will graduate relatively soon, and if it turns out to take a while, then the problem may correct itself. In any case, I fully expect that eventually we'll have enough 3k users that closing/reopening question will never be something we have to worry about, but I'm not sure we're there yet.

So, with regards to this situation, here are my questions:


Is this actually a problem, or am I just paranoid? It could be that we've reached a point where we don't need so many close voters, e.g. if the current high rep voters are already mostly handling it.
If this is a problem, is there anything we should do about it? If so, what? The only things I can think of are requesting to delay our graduation (how long?) and voting more (how would we encourage this?).

If they graduate the site, there will be no way that I will be able to do anything else on this site and it will probably take me a year just to reach 700 reputation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MiharuDante While this isn't directly related to the questions I was asking, the best advice I can give you for gaining rep is to answer questions in which you're an expert. Once you get a few solid answers under your belt, they tend to accumulate rep without even doing anything. It's not that hard to gain over 100 points from a single in-depth and well-referenced answer, especially for popular series.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's actually not that easy to get a lot of rep here. In order to answer a question, you often need to have seen the show. And then for the most part, only others who have seen the show will upvote you. Personally, I've seen over 200 shows. Once a week there will be a question on one of them. A subset of which I can answer. Of which only another subset am I able to get there first before someone beats me with what I wanted to say.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally I think our questions/day ratio is more of a concern than the amount of high repped users considering the visits/day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko Our Q/D numbers could be improved, but I'm not convinced it's a critical issue. For comparison, we've actually been getting more questions per day right recently than [Movies & TV SE](http://movies.stackexchange.com/), which nonetheless has 35 users at 3k rep and hasn't graduated yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MiharuDante: it's also worth noting that (most?) means of gaining rep here aren't related to the moderation privileges as well.



















  If this is a problem, is there anything we should do about it? 


Yes. Get your house in order! And don't forget to vote!

There are enough folks with enough privileges right now to do a thorough spring cleaning. Get rid of crap, up-vote hidden gems, elevate good questions and bury mediocre ones. https://anime.stackexchange.com/unansweredStart here

Those 180 users with 200+ rep? You can all vote. Up and down. This is one of the most important privileges on the site, the one that effectively controls all the rest... So use it!

If you follow this advice, by the time y'all graduate you'll have a site that doesn't require large numbers of high-rep users... But you'll have plenty of them anyway. So get to work...

There are sites which host legal material that is free. CrunchyRoll is an example of this (though there is a premium version). They do their licensing through advertising.

In this case I think it's best just to do some basic research. Sites like CrunchyRoll, Funimation, and YouTube generally have licensed materials; in the case that they don't (specifically with YouTube), it's YouTube's job to handle the legality of the embedding, not ours. Worst case scenario, they'll take down the video.

From my perspective, what we want to avoid is linking to sites that are clearly just for streaming/downloading fansubs or scanlations. These are generally unofficial (and thus unlicensed, and illegal).

So, I'd say, yes, feel free to link to channels such as Funimation's.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The main problems with linking to any content are the ethical and the legal one (IANAL). Linking to a illegal site can cause legal trouble for SE (and that is why we flag and take them down) because people may think that SE is referring the linked site. And is unethical because if you consume a content, you have to pay to the content owner in some way. As キルア said, when you use one of the legal sites, the royalties are already being paid somehow.


















The current tag is not 100% accurate to begin with.

The official translated name would be Kiss×sis instead of Kissxsis. Following google trending  http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Kiss%C3%97sisKiss×sis Is a term only used in japan and would be bad for SEO.

Also I don't find this to be the same case as Rosario+vampire. As there it was mainly a issue about the fact that the + would split up the tag into 2 different tags, which is not the case here.

As for its current naming it will hit both http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kissxsisKissxsis and http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kiss%20x%20siskiss x sis searching, broadening the SEO.

For http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kiss%20siskiss sis hits both kiss x kiss and sis x kiss. Which are both pretty common typo's on the series.

There for my suggestion would be maintaining its current tag for SEO, or changing it to kiss-x-sis as this also maintains SEO.

As was suggested https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/867/49by Shog9-sama, I hereby call upon all the users to help with some site cleanup, so that we're all tidied up for our big graduation party~  

I'd like to ask the community:


Are there questions we want to get completely rid off?  
Questions left open that should be closed according to new policies set recently?  
Or maybe questions you feel are closed and could be reopened with some editing or because of new rules?  
Are there any good and possibly underrated questions that should be upvoted and/or featured and are there any bad and/or overrated questions buried?  


Meta posts such as https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/834/49this one have also arrived at some consensus, and its effects should also be rolled in (and /questions/tagged/faqfaq'ed as well, for new users).

Before our big launch we should clean up the house, so that we won't have a hard time managing once many users lose some of their privileges.
Plus, this is a great time to get a fresh face before a possible swarm of new users (due to our launch), making sure all (or at least most) of our decisions and actions toward posts are consistent (avoiding questions like "Why was mine closed and this one left open?").

Please leave your answer with what you think needs some cleaning up.
Whatever the community decides needs some cleaning up will later be compiled into another meta post with some guidelines and all.

Now unleash the maids!

If there are any _egregiously_ bad answers, downvote them (and cast deletion votes if available).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We should also focus our attention on [this SEDE query](http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/174662), which lists the questions that have the most views, and which are thus the "face" of our site in a sense, since they draw the most search engine traffic (about 38% of all views are on these 50 questions). As usual, upvote, downvote, edit, flag, delete, post better answers if you have them, etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for "Now unleash the maids!" and the following imageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yet another thing: we have some users that don't speak English as a first language. This is, of course, totally fine, but it might be nice to go through and edit some of these users' posts for grammar and general readability.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Add to the check list the tag wiki's/excerpt for attribution.


















For the most part, no, we should not be reopening most of these sorts of questions.

The reason we don't allow questions about unannounced future events is that we aren't a news source. We'd be spectacularly bad at these sorts of questions if we allowed them. No one here is likely to have any knowledge related to these things that is not public. Even if we did, it would be impossible without a legitimate source to provide an acceptable answer. As a result, there are at least two big problems with such questions. One is that most of them will never be answered, or even answerable. That isn't the case once an announcement is made, so it isn't an issue for this class of question.

However, the other problem is that once an announcement is made, the question is essentially immediately obsolete here as soon as it is answerable. The information gets posted on every major anime website, literally overnight. http://www.animenewsnetwork.comANN, http://myanimelist.net/MAL, http://www.crunchyroll.com/Crunchyroll, and even http://www.wikipedia.org/Wikipedia will all have the information readily available for anyone searching for it. We aren't helping anyone find information that they couldn't already get by going to any of these places (as any reasonable person would do). That's still a problem for the question in the OP, and at this point even if we reopened it and answered it I'm not sure it would actually help anyone.

The argument above that we shouldn't reopen the question just because the answer is covered other places does have its flaws. We tend to be pretty lenient towards even relatively low-effort questions here. However, there's another good reason we don't want this sort of question open. It sets a precedent for lots of future questions, almost all of which would need to be closed. In that sense, it's a huge broken window. In the early days of https://stackoverflow.com/Stack Overflow, many questions not about programming were asked, and some had pretty useful answers even if they were off-topic. However, a lot of them ended up inspiring a large number of copycat questions which were generally of low quality. This is a big part of why SO began more aggressively closing off-topic questions. This is probably a good lesson to take from SO despite the fact that we're a very different community in terms of standards. Keeping the question closed helps to avoid this copycat problem.

So no, there shouldn't be an exception for most of these questions. The only ones that deserve to be reopened are ones that a reasonable person might ask after hearing the announcement. For instance, if someone had asked "Which light novels will the second season of SAO adapt?" before it was announced, that question could be reopened after the announcement. The run-of-them-mill "Will X get an anime?" questions should not be reopened though. To phrase that a bit differently, questions asking about and announcement are allowed, but questions asking for an announcement are not.



As a note, in my opinion, questions of the form "Will X get an anime?" should typically be deleted fast enough to avoid this issue anyway. There's really no reason not to delete the questions in this case. There's nothing the OP can change to make it an allowable question. In addition, for whatever reason questions like this seem to generate a lot of undesirable traffic, since they're arriving here on a broken window. We should be deleting them fairly quickly rather than leaving them closed and undeleted indefinitely.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a reasonable stance, but it seems at odds with the comment you made on [the question about Fairy Tail ep 176](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/6571/1908). The SAO S2 question is, at this point (deletion notwithstanding), a question about a future _announced_ event, and thus the same sort of thing as the Fairy Tail question, for which the consensus appears to be "leave open".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin The difference I see between those questions is the following. In the case of Fairy Tail, as I understand it, the break in the anime was always described as a hiatus, meaning that the airing of more was announced. When that would happen was uncertain though. So the question was always on-topic. In the case of SAO, it was likely but unannounced that there would be more, so the question was off-topic when asked. (cont.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...In the case of Fairy Tail, a person who was already aware of the announcement that there would be more to the anime could still reasonably ask that question. The same is not true of the SAO question if it were asked today. If the SAO question had not been "Will there be a continuation of SAO?" but "When will SAO season 2 air?" then I'd be somewhat more in favor of reopening (especially as this info was not part of the original announcement).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, yeah, that makes sense.


















We have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonball-gtdragonball-gt and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball, the latter of which has a space between "dragon" and "ball". As far as I know, in English, the names of these shows are "Dragon Ball GT" and "Dragon Ball", so it seems like we should change https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonball-gtdragonball-gt → https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-gtdragon-ball-gt.

(Is this an utterly trivial matter? Yes. Am I a pedant? Also yes.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Consistent spacing in the Dragon Ball-related tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes plz [dragon-ball-gt].


















Do we want separate tags for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_PilotToaru Hikuushi e no Tsuioku (The Princess and the Pilot) and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pilot%27s_Love_SongToaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta (The Pilot's Love Song)? 

I haven't seen/read Tsuioku, but it seems like we might have a situation where these are two separate series set in the same universe, which happen to intersect one another sometimes, in which case the Railgun/Index precedent suggests that we should introduce a separate tag for Tsuioku (probably princess-and-the-pilot, since adding a the- at the beginning of that takes it over 25 characters).

(I ask because https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8104/is-charles-the-pilot-of-the-seagull-planethis question could use a tag for Tsuioku if in fact we want such a thing.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags for the Toaru-verse (no, the other one)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Think Fma is pretty much the same right, currently using only 1 tag for all the different ones. Even thou some are totaly differnt.


















As part of the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/875/2159preparations to the graduation of the site, I'm proposing to review of all the existent tags wiki/excerpt and write those that aren't still written.

What should you look for:


It's a dump of an out-site resource? write yourself one.
Has inaccurateness? Update it.
Doesn't exist? Write something original
Too short? Expand it.
Not sure what to do? Ask in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-Chat!


For you lazy like me efficient users, http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/revision/175433/224687/tags-with-tag-wikisI modified some query in the SEDE to find the ones that are currently written and pasted it below which have more than 10 questions. http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/revision/175433/224693/tags-without-tag-wikisThis other query will find the ones that still doesn't exist, so you can find tags to write a master piece!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's cleanup the tag wiki/excerpt!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've mentioned this before, but perhaps it's time to standardize formatting of tag wikis for series tags? Not a huge issue but it's a lot easier to do before we graduate since the number of users able to review will drop after graduation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Sounds like an excellent idea. Thoughts: I'm not sure we need very much content at all in the body of a tag wiki for a series. For very general information like "what is this series about", I think it makes the most sense to just provide a very brief description (~excerpt-sized or so), followed by pointers to places like Wikipedia, MAL, etc for further reading. (With extra information where necessary, of course, e.g. FMA vs. FMAB, disambiguating the Type-Moon universe, etc.)


















Note that though all users may propose edits, you must have a certain amount of reputation for your edits to go through immediately without review - 1000 rep for edits to questions/answers, and 4000 rep for edits to tag wikis.

Answering


https://anime.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=newestAnswer unanswered questions! - Given that this is a question-and-answer site, perhaps the most unseemly thing would be for us to have a large number of questions without answers. Scroll through this list every so often (perhaps https://anime.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged?tab=mytagslooking only at questions in tags where you've already answered a number of questions) and see if you can't answer a question that hasn't been answered.


General editing


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/untagged+or+retagHandle questions that need retagging - Some questions end up tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/untaggeduntagged. If these questions are on their way to deletion, you can just leave them be, but if not (e.g. if they are closed as a duplicate or something), you should assign an actual tag to the question. 
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/201240/cleanup-find-posts-that-could-probably-use-some-copy-editingFind questions that could probably use copy-editing - This query uses a number of proxies for finding posts that could probably do with being overhauled in terms of capitalization, spelling, grammar, etc. 
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/203954/cleanup-find-code-formattingFind questions that use code formatting - There are some legitimate uses for code formatting (e.g. simulating tables), but they are few and far between on this site, since this isn't a programming-related site. Users often incorrectly use code formatting when they should use quote formatting; use this query to identify those instances and clean them up.
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/303982/posts-containing-google-redirect-linksFind questions and answers containing Google redirect links - Occasionally, users may copy-pasta links directly from Google search result, which are turned into a big mess of redirect link courtesy of Google. Edit all those redirect links into direct link to the intended page.


Salvaging


https://anime.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=Delete&daterange=last30daysEvaluate questions with existing deletion votes (requires 2000+ rep) - This is part of the standard set of moderation tools, and allows you to see questions that have received at least one deletion vote in the past 30 days. If you think the question should be deleted, cast your vote. If you disagree, leave a comment explaining why or otherwise make the question better. You can also look at questions that have recently been deleted and cast undelete votes where appropriate. In general, you should only vote to delete posts that are either 1) very old and reasonably bad; or 2) egregiously bad and utterly beyond salvation.
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/revision/320023/414049/list-of-posts-with-pending-delete-votesEvaluate questions and answers with existing deletion votes (Data Explorer) - Same as above.
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/303966/posts-in-danger-of-automatic-deletionPreemptive evaluation of questions in danger of automatic deletion - Review the question and see whether the question is worth keeping on our site. If you think the question is good, upvote the question to minimal threshold (score +1 for question with owner, score +2 for question without owner). If the question has already passed the threshold, there is no need to force yourself to upvote it if you find it mediocre. Do not blindly upvote/downvote everything in the list


Tag wikis and excerpts


http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/175431/cleanup-find-markdown-in-tag-wiki-excerptsFind tag wiki excerpts that probably contain markdown - Since the page for editing a tag wiki doesn't include a preview for the excerpt, some users will use markdown (mostly italics) and expect it to render correctly. However, tag wiki excerpts do not permit any sort of markdown. Click through the links in this query and edit out any markdown you find in the excerpts (and fix anything else you find while you're there!). The query should also catch furigana formatting (e.g. 日本​{にほん}), which will render successfully in the excerpts (since it's client side) but will also mess up spacing, and hence should not be used anyway.
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/198067/cleanup-find-tag-wikis-with-blank-excerptsFind empty tag wiki excerpts - All tag wiki excerpts should have something in them, even if it's as straightforward as "[series name] is a [anime/manga/etc] by [author]". 
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/200384/cleanup-find-long-tag-wiki-excerptsFind long tag wiki excerpts - Tag wiki excerpts should be reasonably concise. Look over this query and remove excess verbiage from excerpts if you can do so without making the excerpt unclear. Pay particular attention to those that have a "YES" in the "Truncated?" column.


Images


http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/180619/cleanup-find-images-not-hosted-on-imgurFind images that aren't hosted on imgur - Users sometimes hotlink images from other sites in their questions and answers, which can be a problem for us if the hotlinked site takes down the images at some point. These images should be rehosted on stack.imgur.com (hit Ctrl+G when editing). Note that this query won't catch images hosted on sites beginning whose URLs begin with the letter i, e.g. imageshack.
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/189404/cleanup-find-images-without-proper-alt-textAdd alt-text to images that don't have it - for the sake of accessibility/searchability/whatever, it is generally helpful to have some sort of alt-text for images. Click through the posts in this query and add alt-text to any images that don't have any.


Japanese-related


http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/180823/cleanup-find-seo-unfriendly-romanizations-in-titlesFind macrons and circumflexes in titles - We've found that questions containing words with macrons (e.g. Yūji, Kyōko, etc.) don't tend to show up when people google for the un-macron'd words (resp. Yuuji/Yuji and Kyouko/Kyoko), which makes for bad SEO. Macron-containing words in titles should be respelled to avoid the use of macrons.
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/196749/cleanup-find-furigana-that-uses-curly-bracesFind posts that use {} for furigana - Mobile users are better served by furigana that uses 【】 rather than {} whenever feasible, since the former is significantly more readable inline. 


Comment cleanup


http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/201239/cleanup-find-comments-that-are-probably-obsoleteFind comments that might be obsolete - While I'm not a fan of aggressively deleting comments, some comments are obviously obsolete and not worth keeping around - for example, comment chains that go like "You should include this fact in your answer" / "I have included this fact, thanks". Look through the comments shown in this query, and evaluate which of them should be flagged as obsolete. This query is not perfect - do not go through and flag all of them willy-nilly!


Miscellaneous


http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/199825/view-recent-edits-to-tag-wikis-and-excerptsView recent edits to tag wikis and excerpts - https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/232332/224428In the absence of a built-in way to sort tags by most-recently-edited, this is a kludge to emulate that in SEDE.

There is an automatic deletion script that runs which will delete it after 9 days, that is to make sure OP has enough time to improve his post and get it reopened.


















My personal opinion on  https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangakamangaka and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangakamangaka needs to be used when the question pertains directly to a specific mangaka, the job of being a mangaka, or the work a mangaka does.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production by contrast can be any part of development of manga, including the work a mangaka does.


So, we have something like a Venn-diagram: some questions may have both tags and be full legitimate, but there will still be questions with just one or the other.

As for specific questions (in order of "newest" in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangakamangaka):


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7233/is-there-a-list-of-banned-manga-artist-whose-work-are-not-translated-into-englishttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7233/is-there-a-list-of-banned-manga-artist-whose-work-are-not-translated-into-englis - VTC'd, I don't know how this wasn't closed sooner. Tags? Probably https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangakamangakahttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production, but really, who cares? I think the question should be deleted.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6162/is-dwun-wdwune-based-on-yoshihiro-togashiIs Dwun (Wdwune) based on Yoshihiro Togashi? - Should remain, and keep https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangakamangaka as it is specific to a mangaka.

There we go. I think #1, #7, #8, and #11 can have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangakamangaka removed, but these definitely need a case-by-case look.

I'm not sure that's *necessary*, but it does seem like the experts in each category would not be the same. Perhaps bring this up in chat sometime to get some more community input?


















Lately if been skimming around the questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request to see if I could manage to answer some. And noticed that allot of questions either put a whole question in there like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6887/what-is-this-manga-with-a-female-protagonist-that-changes-genders-and-personalitWhat is this manga with a female protagonist that changes genders and personalities based on the rings she wears?

and it seems the question titles start to go even broader in variety with the latest post being
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8190/i-beg-for-help-kind-stranger-identification-request-pleasehttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8190/i-beg-for-help-kind-stranger-identification-request-please
(besides the fact this Identification request definitely should be removed from the title) I was wondering if we maybe should adopt a rule in naming identification-requests 

The options I taught of myself if it is deemed necessary would be either. 


Just use universal naming, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7594/i-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-mangahttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7594/i-cant-remember-the-name-of-this-manga

  The following is outdated and exists solely for archival purposes


Hey you! You're probably here, because you asked an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question that was "put on hold" or "closed." 
If you would care to know why, please take sometime to read https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2490/a-new-users-guide-to-our-site-and-whats-wrong-with-their-identification-reque/2491#2491this meta. 

In short, these guidelines are here to help us help you find what you're looking for. We realize you can't remember everything, but every bit of detail you can remember (no matter how insignificant it may seem) can be a lot of help. All we ask for you to fulfill, at minimum, three (3) of these guidelines.

If you are unsure of what you need to include, please look over the checklist in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2661/lets-help-id-request-users-help-themselves-with-a-floating-checklist-guide-forthis meta.

Please note that questions with ONLY an image(s), audio, and/or video(s) are https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2725/policy-review-image-only-id-requests/2726#2726off-topic.

Taking cues from sites like TV & Movies.SE, Sci-Fi.SE, and Arqade, I've come up with the following guidelines:


  An https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request should have as many of the following points as possible:
  
  
  Any description of the leading/recurring character(s) (i.e. physical description, behavior, etc.)
  Any description of any distinctive features, including the plot and related elements (e.g. girls who are soda cans that do battle, or i.e., the setting, the plot)
  What the genre or cinematic style was (e.g. mecha, sci-fi, fantasy, shonen, shoujo, seinen, noir, cyberpunk, etc.)
  What the drawing/animation style is like
  When and where you saw it (if you saw it when you were a kid, don't give your age, give the approximate year, and month if possible)
  Who the publisher, licensor, and/or distributor was
  Type of media: TV show, OVA, movie, manga, web-series, one-shot, etc.
  Any image(s), audio, or video(s) related to the series (an exception may be made for questions with one or more of these items)
  
  
  If you are unsure of what you need to include, please look over the checklist in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2661/lets-help-id-request-users-help-themselves-with-a-floating-checklist-guide-forthis meta.
  
  For a detailed example and explanation of how to properly ask for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions w/o any audio-visual artefacts, please read https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/783/what-kind-of-policy-should-we-adopt-for-current-and-future-identification-reque/792#792this answer.
  
  For a more in-depth explanation of the why we're asking you to provide such details, refer to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2473/63this post.


In addition to the above guidelines, here are some suggestions to improve the quality of your https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions:


  Make Sure To Have A Descriptive Title
  
  All https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions should have a title that is phrased or edited to be phrased as a question containing at least one pertinent detail from the body of the question. Vague titles like "Requesting an anime identification" or "What is this anime show?" will lower the visibility of your question by fellow users since they'll have to click on it to find out what it's about. This shows a lack of effort on your part. Why should someone make an effort to help you if you can't properly format the question in your title?
  
  Don't Ask Too Much All At Once
  
  Please limit your https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions to ask for only one series or piece per question. Questions asking us to identify multiple unrelated media will only dilute the quality of responses with partial answers.
  
  Try Searching For The Image First
  
  Please questions with ONLY an image(s), audio, and/or video(s) are https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2725/policy-review-image-only-id-requests/2726#2726off-topic. If you're looking for the source of an anime image try doing a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618/how-can-i-identify-an-anime-using-reverse-image-searchreverse image search search yourself.


We want to maintain a consistent quality for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question and have no choice but to enforce a minimum standard of acceptable quality. 

We're not asking you to write an essay, but we expect you to at least make an attempt to fulfill the bare minimum, so we have some solid leads to go on:


  The Bare Minimum
  
  As a bare minimum your question needs meet three of these guidelines. If you are unsure of what you need to include, please look over the checklist in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2661/lets-help-id-request-users-help-themselves-with-a-floating-checklist-guide-forthis meta.

Please try to doing a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618/where-is-this-picture-from-how-do-i-use-reverse-image-search-to-find-the-sourcereverse image search yourself.
  
  Even if the aforementioned minimum guidelines are met, if the description provided is determined to be too ambiguous or generic, it will be put on hold as:
  
  
  "Off-Topic: This question does not meet our minimum standard for identification-based questions." 
  


Even if you question has been closed, it doesn't mean that it's the end of the line. Please try to review your question and make an attempt to addition details. 

If you are unsure of what you need to include, please look over the checklist in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2661/lets-help-id-request-users-help-themselves-with-a-floating-checklist-guide-forthis meta. 

If you need help, feel free to reach out to the moderators or other users. We'll try to help you as best we can.


  Reopening a Closed/On-Hold Question
  
  If your question has been https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2491/63"put on hold" or "closed", it's not too late to edit your question to include more details, we'll be more than happy to reopen your question once other users have reviewed and determined that there is sufficient detail to go about to helping you identify what you're looking for.

In that case, the other points are typically mostly useless for the purpose of identification anyway, and in most cases wouldn't be known to the OP. Almost all questions we've had of this kind in the past haven't satisfied the, but as far as I know [only one](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7438/what-is-this-shoujo-manga-pic-included) is unanswered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should description of plot elements or events also be part of the list?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Try Searching For The Image First" is a nonsense. If the OP was able to find the image of the serie he is asking about, and had small knowledge about the serie beforehand except for the name, finding an image for the sake of the question rules in this SE site would automagically answer his question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LuisMasuelli you underestimate the laziness and technical expertise of the average internet user. More than half of them don't even know they can search for a word in a browser using "Crtl+F." Site the SO and SU expect a minimum level of technical expertise when using their site, but we're a recreational site about Japanese cartoon and comic. Even though we're part of the SE family of site, expectations are set pretty low, since most of our traffic comes from the great wilderness that is internet search engine results.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LuisMasuelli Just like "homework" questions on certain SE sites and questions asking ppl to write code solutions without showing any work, we're telling users, if you just want us to do your work for you, sho that you've at least made an attempt yourself and why it didn't work. "I'm lazy, do this for me" is not an acceptable reason.


















You need to remove the tag from whatever questions it's currently on (at the moment there are none so you're already done with that). After that, just wait for the tag to be automatically removed. This should happen daily at 3:00 UTC so long as it isn't being used on any questions at that time.

Elaborating on Senshin's answer, I believe it should remain.

Counter Arguments to Senshin

Every single question tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismsymbolism is also tagged with something else, suggesting that it doesn't really stand alone. 

This can be said for of other tags, really the majority of tags which can "stand alone" are those for series. Tags like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismsymbolism are like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/theme-songtheme-song or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes, adding the series you are talking in your question about can allow others who may know the answer take notice especially with how the Favorites Tags Function allows one to have question highlighted (we see tags being used to try and draw attention with with request lists where a user will use the anime they mention or the most popular anime as their tags). 

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/theme-songtheme-song has only 2 questions which it is used stand alone and they are more general to music themselves, out of the rest of the questions https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3135/1587one was tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismsymbolism so while one could have removed https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/theme-songtheme-song and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toradoratoradora since Toradora was mentioned in the question title and we would assume the theme song with the use of ED, however the question may not have gotten the initial exposure had these tags not been included.

You can't be an expert on "symbolism" in general

This is true, at the same time, no one can claim to be an expert of any one series tag except for the original creator and only because they have inside knowledge,

ie. I may know allot about the Nasuverse (Fate/, Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai) but Kinoko Nasu is the only one who can be called an expert, he created a lot of the themes in the Nasuverse and only he can say without speculation what happened between Brunestud of the Crimson Moon and Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg. 

In school for about a semester (12-14 weeks approx) my English class studied the symbolism used in a movie and in "A Man of all Seasons" and this was also the case for the exams. The same in my Media class when studying Nuclear Weapons used in 007 Goldfinger and Dr Strangelove and the symbolism of them as reflect during the time they was made. while we was not learning to be experts we was taught the techniques to identity and research symbolism and some people are interested in learning the symbolism behind what they see.

Notes

Since this is our 16th-most-used tag, it will show up in the page title of any question that isn't also tagged with one of the top 15 tags, which isn't that great in terms of search engine search ability.

Actually I think I read a question on a meta regarding tags and having some sort of definable rating to stop something like this though I can't remember where exactly of it's status

Personal opinion

I believe we should keep it as there are plenty of anime which people may ask about the symbolism of certain plot points and the like, eg.


Luffy giving his straw at to Nami before fighting Arlong
The Devolving Butterfly to a Leaf in Revolutionary Girl Utena
The colored scenes in the Monogatari


Not everyone will understand them right away and sometimes the symbolism may not be in any anime but other works such a literature of history and in my opinion if a question is mainly asking about symbolism she should have it as a tag especially if it's seen over a number of different titles
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding the tag overriding, I have [this feature request](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/803/low-priority-tags-for-seo), which is probably what you're thinking of, but it's quite unlikely to be implemented. For that reason we shouldn't base any policy decisions on it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the context of Stack Exchange, "expert" just means "someone who knows a lot about the topic". As far as this site is concerned, someone who has watched all of the Naruto anime and read all the Naruto manga would probably be an "expert on Naruto".


















this is the first time I'm in meta, so I don't really know how it work but but one of you suggesting me to ask this on meta

I want to reopen my question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8051/is-there-any-famous-doujinshi-artistis there any famous doujinshi artist? but it close as too broad, I already tried to make it not too broad by adding this


  Maybe not world wide but national wide? 


but apparently it's not enough, how can I make this question not too broad?

Thanks for your concern 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Request to reopen question because closed as too broadb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The scope of possible answers to your question is quite broad. It's like asking are there any self-published independant music artist that are famous nationally? It depends on the genre and audience. Some people might have heard of them while others haven't. What you need is something gauge them by (like in an award ceremony). E.g. best selling artist, most listened downloaded, most talked about in X year/quarter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As what @Krazer has said you might want to define what genre and audience yoiur looking at but also if you happen to be refering original doujin or doujin based off an existsing series, if the latter you might want to define the series cause a well known Yuru Yuri doujin circle may be unknown because they are eclypsed by Madoka dujin circle.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5zargin also said in his comment, maybe you could ask about those who became well know enough they decided to go pro limiting answers to say the past decade or so, from what i remember Type-Moon was originally a doujin circle


















What is the criteria for this and are we allowed to ask questions on animes shows that are usually Yaoi or Yuri related in nature? Please do not get this confused with Hentai!

An answer would be nice. I would like to know since it seems that hentai related questions seem to be allowed. Not sure why though?

Answers are appreciated.

Note: I am asking this question because I was planning on asking questions related to a Yaoi such as Jonjou Romantica. What is your opinion on this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is Yaoi and Yuri on-topic on A&M.SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should point out, in Japan, the terms Yuri/Yaoi include all works of those themes including hentai, it is in the west that the terms particularly relate to henati. if you happen to be in the west and you want to mention Yuri/Yaoi but make sure no one confuses it for Hentai you can use the terms Shoujo Ai (Yuri) and Shounen Ai (Yaoi). that being said, anyone who is really invested in Yuri/Yaoi who can give you good quality answers will know that when you say Yuri/Yaoi you not talking about only hentai


















Being a fan of both Western comics and Japanese manga, I notice that a massive difference is that Western artists like Stan Lee will create a character and then allow other people to write stories based on their character (in exchange for royalty fees). Japanese artists never do that, and that's probably the reason why most manga series end while Western superheros have been going strong for decades.

I've never quite understood why this is so. It would appear to be profitable for Kishi to license the Naruto universe to other artists, and let it grow and go on forever. Is there some reason most artists don't do this? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would it be on-topic to ask why few (if any) Japanese manga artists license their characters out to other artists?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you talking about the practice of spin-off series by different artist? It's a perfectly valid "manga-production" question. I believe that it's usually handled by the company that contracts the author I believe, with some input by the author. Sometimes the author does multiple series at once, like the author or Magi and the Sinbad spinoff.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Heh, are you asking if you can ask it, or are you asking it? In any case, yes, this question is on-topic. Would you like it moved to the main site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great! I wasn't sure, so I posted the full question here. I'll rephrase it and add examples tonight, then I'll ask it in the main section. Thanks!


















Sometimes I get confused about this, should I tag my question with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-majutsu-no-indextoaru-majutsu-no-index or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-kagaku-no-railguntoaru-kagaku-no-railgun? And I ended up using both tags for my question.

Based on the question about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2675/how-are-a-certain-magical-index-and-a-certain-scientific-railgun-connectedHow are "A Certain Magical Index" and "A Certain Scientific Railgun" connected?, these two anime are the same. Or so I understand the answer, maybe I got it wrong?

And I saw a question about https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/308/should-multiple-continuities-have-individual-tagsShould multiple continuities have individual tags? and according to Kuwaly's answer,


  For Neon Genesis Evangelion, and in general, I think having a policy of fewer-is-better should be used when regarding tags


Don't you think the same policy should apply for Railgun and Index? Can't we just make a synonym or something?

I don't think that it's a good idea. Index and Railgun are two series that play in the same universe and share some characters, but that's all (only one arc is happens in both animes yet (and doesn't share much, actually), the others are completely independent. I don't know about the Daihasei Festival Arc, but it seems like they are independent, too). One could have seen Railgun without knowing of Index (or the other way round) and can answer the question if it is really about Railgun. 

Index and Railgun are just too distinct to be handled with one tag, imo.

FMA 2005 is only known as FMA (because that's the name) and FMA BH is known as FMA, too (because it's the story of the manga FMA) Nobody could see which storyline is meant if both tags are usable and "FMA" is chosen 2.) It's just an alternate storyline with the same main-characters and the same beginning. Railgun/Index is different because it only shares the universe.


















I was reviewing low-quality answers and stumbled over this one: https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/8395/122https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/8395/122

Below the answer, there's the following note:


  We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed.


"Okay", I thought, "then let's vote to delete it" because it seems like a guess. However, the following reasons for deletion are available:


No comment needed
This is an commentary on another post, not an answer
This is a "Thank You" comment
This is an "I have a problem, too" comment
This is a different question posted as an answer
This is a link-only answer (and not spam)


I don't know what I should choose if the answer has no explanations. Should such answers deleted in the first place?

Are questions about crunchyroll (and other popular anime-focused software) on topic here?  I figured the users most likely to be able to answer a question about crunchyroll would be here, but there is a webapps SE site.  I know Arqade takes questions about Steam, which in itself is not a game.

I will think about it. Sounds like a possibility.

I think allowing questions about CrunchyRoll as a service has three issues:

1. You will get a better answer elsewhere.

It is highly unlikely that the people on our Q&A site will know better than CrunchyRoll support, a related forum, or the https://webapps.stackexchange.com/Web Apps Stack Exchange.

2. There won't be many of these questions.

Aside from individual issues of people who already use this site, there will be few issues brought up at all. This isn't to say we want more—I'm simply getting at the fact that there's no need for us to permit these as it's not going to bring down our current quality standards to ignore them.

3. It has great implications.

Say we allow questions about CrunchyRoll. What else do we allow? MyAnimeList? Hummingbird.me? The domino effect of allowing such questions would be grand.

Therefore, with these said, I am against allowing questions about CrunchyRoll in general.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. This is exactly right. Also we must take into consideration that really asking questions about CrunchyRoll is not really on topic at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MiharuDante The entire _point_ of this discussion is to determine whether or not questions about Crunchyroll are on topic or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it is ontopic though. The reason: Questions talking about CrunchyRoll are not anime or manga and should be based on statistics, plot holes, characters or settings in a Anime or Manga or Identification Requests so long as they are related to A&M.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**1 -** You may get a better answer elsewhere, but frankly if you wanted to ask any question on this site to the company making the anime/manga, then you would "get a better answer". **2 -** Frequency of questions is a poor excuse.  Over half of our tags are only used once ([page 8+](http://anime.stackexchange.com/tags?page=8&tab=popular)). **3 -** Limit the topics to legal sources that are anime-focused.  We can have a discussion on what sources we allow and if new ones pop up we can discuss those later.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**1** - Not true. If you email a company asking them about their anime or manga, they'll ignore you. CrunchyRoll is a user-oriented service. **2** - I'm not talking about an unused tag; I'm talking about questions regarding services in general. All those once-used tags are about specific anime(s), so they all fall under one category: anime questions. **3** - Legal sources that are anime focused? That's *huge*. Though, I admit, this is the least worrisome of the three points, IMO.


















I think that following Arqade's policy on Steam (cf. https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6890/why-are-steam-questions-on-topicthis thread on meta.Arqade) is the right way to go about this. In particular, there is definitely merit in allowing questions about services operated by licensed vendors of anime/manga/etc, such as Crunchyroll, Funimation, etc. Whether or not services operated by other parties (e.g. MAL, etc.) should be on topic is a separate issue (personally, I am ambivalent about this). 

Note the following, partially in rebuttal to Eric:


"You will get a better answer elsewhere" has never really been a good reason for deeming things off-topic on StackExchange. The entire point of SE (as I see it, anyway) is to become the place to get the best answers for your questions. Certainly, there will be some questions that are only answerable by Crunchyroll support ("I can't log into my account halp plox"), but there will be others that are answerable by ordinary folks like us (e.g. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6266/is-the-version-of-madoka-magica-on-crunchyroll-the-dvd-versionIs the version of Madoka Magica on Crunchyroll the DVD version?). 
The largest community of experts on Crunchyroll/etc on StackExchange is almost certainly found here, not on Webapps.SE or anywhere else. 
I disagree that the implications are "great". There is a finite and short list of services that are Crunchyroll-like, about which I propose we accept questions. In fact, let me list most of them: Crunchyroll, Funimation, Daisuki, Aniplex Channel, Madman, and maybe Hulu and Youtube. There's probably a few UK/Australia services I missed there, but you get the idea - there aren't that many of these services out there.


This being the case, I propose that we revise our list of on-topic things to include something in the vein of https://gaming.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicArqade's "Game-specific hardware and utilities" that accurately outlines the types of anime services that are kosher for this site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**1** - Yes, we'd like to become the place with the best answers. But can we answer anything about CrunchyRoll better than their tech support, whose sole purpose is to answer those questions? Absolutely not. **2** - But the people who use CrunchyRoll here do not necessarily have answers about it, just like users of Microsoft Word should not be the target of Word-related questions. Additionally, having the knowledge here shouldn't make it on-topic. **3** - That's already seven, plus the two I listed above. Where do we stop?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric **1** - No, but there are some questions we can answer _just as well_ as their tech support (cf. the one I linked), and those questions would be well-served by being asked here, where they're more findable. **2** - I see what you're saying, but I don't think there's much of a dichotomy between users and experts when it comes to Crunchyroll/etc. **3** - We stop when we've listed all the anime streamers. Streamed anime is a niche market, and there aren't all that many players in it.


















To make my answer as simple as possible-

No, CrunchyRoll is not on-topic. My reason for this is this...


  Questions should tend to be related/affiliated towards to Anime or Manga. The purpose of this site is for people to ask about identification-requests of forgotten animes or characters you may have forgotten or would like to find out and would like to know about, statistical questions such as "Who watches the most anime", or questions that ask about an anime/mangas plot, characters, places or terminology that you may not have understood.


Just because CrunchyRoll is an anime-focused software does not mean that it is on-topic on Anime and Manga because as the name implies it does not say Anime Software and Hardware.

We try to encourage questions that ask about something specific and relevant to an Anime (Show/TV-Series), Manga or Light Novel.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If this is the case then all questions about anime-production, manga-production, and japanese-language should be off-topic.  None of those are "about something specific and relevant to an Anime (Show/TV-Series), Manga or Light Novel" any more than crunchyroll is relevant to watching an anime.


















I have noticed that the first thing a new user does on this site is...


  Asks a question about recommendations on what anime to watch next and vice versa.


I think we need to make this more clear on Anime and Manga.SE. We should clearly state in the tour not to ask questions such as this. But this is where we come to problem number 2...


  Almost every new users does not read the Tour section of our website


So what would be the recommended action for this? Also when flagging questions like this what should I flag it as?

Off-Topic or Opinion Based. Both these options however don't exactly sound right though. Should we make a new option in/under "It should be closed for other reasons"?

I'll first let you know to keep in mind that you can undelete (your own) questions freely.

As for your main question, there is a set of criteria for keeping reputation on a deleted question (or answer), which can also be found https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/5222here:


The post must be at least 60 days old.
You must have earned a net score of +3 or higher to keep the reputation.


So, if you have only one upvote on a question, you would lose that reputation.

To be frank, though, a single +5 isn't worth worrying over if you think the question isn't a good one to keep around. On the other hand, if you simply already know the answer, you could post an answer yourself. (See: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/29850When to delete your own question)

I was recently reviewing a new users first post when I noticed this....


  This is a new user's answer to an old question. Watch for hidden gems, non-answers, and spam. 


I've seen this notification/banner a hundred times and not once did I think about the words "Hidden Gems" until now. So what are they?

Heres what the banner looks like.



Answers are appreciated. :)

According to https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/40354the Stack Exchange glossary, this is the definition of a hidden gem:


  This term refers to a post that is surprisingly outstanding in quality, especially coming from a new user. Those are hard to find and rare, so keep your eyes open!


Basically, when a question is left abandoned for a while and then answered later (a month or more), or by a new user, that answer may not get noticed, particularly if the OP doesn't frequent the site. So, even a very good answer might get no upvotes or recognition, which does against the Stack Exchange ideal.

So in the review queue, make sure to upvote and bring attention to posts like this!

Additionally, the standard methods like sharing questions/answers in communities who are interested in such topics are great ways to make sure an answer gets some attention.


















I was interested in writing a short research paper or analysis paper on the anime Shin Sekai Yori, however, I was not sure what type of thesis or main argument/idea to pursue/think about. I had a couple of ideas but wanted to discuss them with this site.

Is asking for such a request on or off topic?

Also, once I have decided my topic, is it on topic to discuss some of my analysis of the anime on this site? Or just ask for general suggestions on what people might feel/think on the topic?

While I still think that https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/896/should-we-get-rid-of-the-symbolism-tagwe should get rid of the symbolism tag, there does not appear to be a strong consensus in favor of doing so. This being the case, somebody who has a good idea of why we should keep the tag needs to clarify https://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/symbolism/infothe tag wiki to make it clear about which questions it should be applied to. As of now, the excerpt reads as follows:


  This tag is for questions looking for meanings, either explicit or subject to interpretation, behind a character, a setting, an action of a character, a plot point.


What does this even mean? What is "the meaning behind a plot point"? Is this for questions like "Why did X happen in anime Y"? If so, there's probably at least a few hundred questions to which this tag should be added - and I don't think we want that. So this needs fixed. 

Whoever fixes this should also fix the body of the wiki, which currently reads:


  Use this tag when the aim of the question is to clarify the intended (or not) meaning of a character, a setting, an action of a character, a plot point, ...
  
  This is a complementary tag, it should be used in addition to some other tag that specifies the franchise in question (e.g. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto for a question regarding the meaning of something that happens in Naruto).


Again, it needs to be made more clear what questions merit having https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismsymbolism applied. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Somebody please clarify the [symbolism] tag wikib2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel that it's a weak tag and should be merged/synonym-ized with tropes, if anything.


















As someone who always looks before I leap, I can say honestly that I wouldn't ask for anime recommendations here. Even on Stack Overflow, my first Stack Exchange site, I made well sure to check the rules more than once over and ensure that I was within bounds.

But that's not what many people do... and probably not what you want to hear. Nor is the rest of the post, probably, but I think it needs to be said anyway.

We need to not worry about people asking for anime recommendations. The close reasons exist for just this; people will skip the tour, will ignore the warnings, no matter how in-your-face they are.

Here's a couple examples of this. First, on all SE sites, to the right of the question box, it says:


  We prefer questions that can be answered, not just discussed.
  Provide details. Share your research.


And yet, people post questions https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/7199/274like this one, or https://stackoverflow.com/q/16872291/1438733this one on Stack Overflow.

Another example is on a subreddit I frequent, where posting links to videos is strictly banned. When you hover over the "share a link" button, it says in a BIG RED BOX, "do not use this to submit videos". There's also a big red box for submission guidelines, and more red boxes on the actual submission page saying not to do it. What do people do? Ignore them all.

It happens, and it always will happen. Many people ignore what they're not looking for. When you see a recommendation question, just hit it with a close vote, leave a comment, and move on. That's how we have to deal with this; there is no way to stop people from asking off-topic or bad questions. If there were such a thing, Stack Overflow would not have 100k+ questions with active close votes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know it always happens, it cant be stopped and its quite true what you said but im not really actually looking to stop it (that's a bit too optimistic), I was just wondering if you were a new user to this site what would be the first question you would ask?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I want to know this due to the fact that many new users seem to ask similar or the same questions. Perhaps its the sites name that they misinterpret. (Not asking to change it though)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MiharuDante Since I never considered myself an expert on anime or manga, I came here to ask questions. So, if [the question I asked first](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/811/274) hadn't yet been asked, it'd be that one. I'm not sure I'm a typical user, though; I'd say the questions that most meta-goers would post are vastly different than a typical user's.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The tour is kinda like with the Terms and Conditions in setup/installation programs, even if you try and force a person to read it before they can continue they'll just scroll to the bottom and hit next.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Adding to what @Eric said about the the box on the right, there's also a link to the [Help Center](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help) which from there you can access the tour, so to get to the tour it's just 2 clicks away. even if we make it more obvious it would only be an improvement of 1 click. if a user can't do 2 clicks to the tour then they aren't going to read the tour even if it was one click away


















So there's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irregular_at_Magic_High_SchoolThe Irregular at Magic High School, right? I just asked https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8829/does-that-weird-translucent-thing-the-girls-wear-serve-any-specific-purposea question about it and provisionally tagged it with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mahouka-koukoumahouka-koukou. Should we stick with this, or pick a different tag? 

We can't use irregular-at-magic-high-school (30 chars) or mahouka-koukou-no-rettousei (27 chars). We could go with a shortening of the Japanese title, like:


mahouka
mahouka-koukou (what I picked)
mahouka-koukou-rettousei


Or, we could shorten the English title, but I'm not sure that there is any shortening that makes good sense (unless we could just do magic-high-school, but that omits the important word "irregular"). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should the tag for Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magic High School be?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am happy with any really, but I definitely wouldn't go for one too long. I might go for the third dotpoint though as it is in my opinion it seems more "complete".


















Excerpts
I propose that excerpts for series contain the full name of a series in Japanese (romanized; there's no point in tossing kanji/kana in there - yes, I know I'm responsible for adding a fair bit of unnecessary Japanese text to the excerpts; I now realize that was stupid). They should also contain any official English localizations of the name and any common ways of referring to them that aren't necessarily official. The names should be ordered from most used to least used.
A reference to an author/director/producer is also helpful to situate the excerpt in context. In most cases, we need not include any other information.
So, for example, here are how some of these would work:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shingeki-no-kyojinshingeki-no-kyojin - Shingeki no Kyojin (or, "Attack on Titan" or "The Eotena Onslaught") is a manga series by Hajime Isayama. (lol jk)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kara-no-kyoukaikara-no-kyoukai - Kara no Kyoukai (or, "The Garden of Sinners") is a light novel series by Nasu Kinoko. (note that we don't include "The Boundary of Emptiness" which is a literal translation of "Kara no Kyoukai", but isn't actually used as a title by anyone)

Now, there are some excerpts that will need additional disambiguation or references to other related tags. We should do so while still maintaining economy of space:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist - Fullmetal Alchemist (the manga; the 2003 anime; and the 2009 anime, subtitled 'Brotherhood'), or "Hagane no Renkinjutsushi" is a series by Hiromu Arakawa.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball - Use this tag for Dragon Ball (the manga by Toriyama Akira and the original anime) as well as Dragon Ball Z. For Dragon Ball GT, use [dragonball-gt].
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monogatari-seriesmonogatari-series - The Monogatari series is a light novel series by Nisio Isin, including Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari, Kizumonogatari, etc.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion - Neon Genesis Evangelion ("Shin Seiki Evangelion") is a 1995 anime series produced by Gainax. Use this tag for Rebuild of Evangelion, too.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-majutsu-no-indextoaru-majutsu-no-index - A Certain Magical Index ("Toaru Majutsu no Index") is a light novel series by Kazuma Kamachi. See also [toaru-kagaku-no-railgun]. (and correspondingly for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/toaru-kagaku-no-railguntoaru-kagaku-no-railgun)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fate-zerofate-zero - Fate/Zero is a light novel series by Urobuchi Gen, and a prequel to [fate-stay-night].

What I'm basically getting at here is that we don't need all this cruft like "...is a shoujo manga series written by such-and-such" or "...consisting of 13 volumes and 42 episodes plus 3 OVAs" or "...in which John Q. Protagonist fights the demons and saves the world" - for the most part nobody needs that information to pick the right tag.
Wikis
I'm not as concerned with standardizing the wikis as I am with standardizing the excerpts, because the wikis frankly aren't that important. As long as they don't grow into enormous unmaintanable monstrosities, whatever, you know.
A few series tags may need to have some clarification about where they should be used (FMA, Raildex, Dragon Ball, and so forth), for which a sentence or two should suffice. Other than that, the only thing I think ought to be a mandatory feature of a tag wiki is a link to the Wikipedia article for the series - or, when there is no such article, a link to the next-best resource, which might be ANN or MAL or something.
Other than those basic requirements, I think that we should allow the tag wikis (but not excerpts) to develop organically - the tag wikis for https://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/naruto/infoNaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/fullmetal-alchemist/infoFMA, https://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/one-piece/infoOne Piece, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/bleach/infoBleach all seem like perfectly reasonable ways of approaching this - one piece of promotional art, a brief summary, a listing of related media, and links to relevant Wikipedia articles.

If we can agree on this, I'd be happy to go through the series tags and 1.) reformat the excerpts per my proposal; 2.) leave the tag wikis mostly untouched except to add Wikipedia links where they are absent; and 3.) cull any cases of plagiarism found in the tag wikis.
Update 2 May 2014: I have basically implemented this proposal for tags with few questions, but will leave tags with 6 or more questions untouched; see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/957/1908here for more details.

If one of you mods is bored and feels like indulging my pedantry, please perform some or all of the the following renames, so as to get the tag names to match up with the correct spacing for the series in question.

I believe we've been through this in another issue.

You can't judge a question by its answers. You can't close a question because the answers on it would be off-topic. Because the asker can't know that in advance.

If the OP asks a question that by definition is off-topic (the question, not the answers). Close it. If it isn't that obvious, asking here on meta is a right course of action.

A question is to remain open until decided otherwise. And if we do decide otherwise, the change will be reflected here on meta and in the help center.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I don't really disagree with letting these questions stay open, these questions strike me as similar to "you forgot a close-parenthesis" questions over at SO, which _do_ get closed. Those questions are treated as off-topic, even though the asker couldn't know that in advance (if they did, they would have added the close-parenthesis and not asked the question in the first place!).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin: Well, in that case, there's a fundamental difference as though *why* these questions get closed. They get closed because the regulars are sick and tired of being human debuggers for people. We aren't there yet. So I say we accept this relatively small margin of error, it's not substantial enough for us to worry.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds fair enough to me.


















I think they should be separate since that series is it's own original story (though there are cameos from the preceding series) rather than a continuation of it's predecessor. 

This is not unlike the relationship between "A Certain Magical Index" and "A Certain Scientific Railgun" series.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good. I've updated the corresponding tag wikis to reflect the relationship between the two shows.


















In tags that are the names of real Japanese people, in which order should we put the people's names?

That is, should we have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hayao-miyazakihayao-miyazaki (Western order) or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/miyazaki-hayaomiyazaki-hayao (Japanese order)? 

Note that this post is not about the way names should be ordered in questions, answers, or tag wikis - only in the names of tags themselves.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Name order for tags like [hayao-miyazaki]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I call myself Madara Uchiha, and not Uchiha Madara, mainly because this is an English speaking site, and just like we write in English here, it's expected by users that we follow English naming conventions etc.


















As it stands, we already have the following tags, which seem to have evolved more or less organically:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hayao-miyazakihayao-miyazaki
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ken-akamatsuken-akamatsu (okay, I changed this one from https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/akamatsu-kenakamatsu-ken for consistency)
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/makoto-shinkaimakoto-shinkai
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mamoru-hosodamamoru-hosoda
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mamoru-oshiimamoru-oshii
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osamu-tezukaosamu-tezuka


All of these are in Western order (i.e. Given-Family). 

I propose that we institute, as an Anime.SE policy, a strong preference that tags for real Japanese people continue to have their names in Western order unless there is a very compelling reason not to do so. 

(We were already doing this, of course; the purpose of this post is basically to formalize the pre-existing practice for future reference.)



Note: we could add synonyms like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/miyazaki-hayaomiyazaki-hayao pointing to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hayao-miyazakihayao-miyazaki, and it would certainly do no harm, but it's also not necessary - when you're searching for tags or entering tags on a new question, typing in "miyazaki" will bring up all tags that have "miyazaki" as a word, including https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hayao-miyazakihayao-miyazaki, even though "miyazaki" isn't at the beginning of that tag. 

If synonyms are implemented, this proposal should basically be read as requiring that the main/master tag be in Western order, with the synonym tag(s) being whatever else.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Couldn't we also just synonym them to each other?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx See edit.


















Over the course of the past few days, I've gone through each tag with five or fewer questions (with a few exceptions; see below) and:


Cleaned up any existing tag wiki/excerpt content, slaying wikiplagiarism where I saw it
Created excerpts where they weren't present and initialized wikis with, at minimum, a link to Wikipedia or the next-best alternative
Renamed a few tags where appropriate


I would like to invite the rest of you to triage the remaining 80-ish tags - this means every tag with 6 or more questions at this time, plus the following tags that I skipped over for whatever reason (unfamiliarity with the topic, no idea what's actually supposed to be in the tag, etc.):

Basically, it would be helpful if you folks would go through the remaining tags and 


Clean up any thing that needs to be cleaned (formatting, grammar, etc.)
Made excerpts reasonably concise, in line with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/938/1908this proposal
Ensured that there was no wikiplagiarism


I'm not going to do this myself because


It doesn't make sense for a single user to make unilateral changes to content that will be seen by a large fraction of the site (i.e. major tags like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production, etc.)
Multiple heads are better than one for this kind of thing.
I'm tired.


On the bright side, now that the massive backlog of excerptless tags has been taken care of, I imagine this should be much easier to keep pace with in the future. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey folks - want to review some tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also did some of that with ~80 tags!


















I've been examining some tags and saw that in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/conventionsconventions tag, we have exactly 3 questions, all of them are closed (2 as off-topic, one as too broad).

Now the questions themselves weren't that 100% great, but the question is, are convention questions on topic at all? If so, what isn't on-topic, and what is? Do we want any questions about conventions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we want questions about conventions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Doe we have any experts on conventions here that can answer such questions? I know I can'tb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we're going to accept [questions on anime clubs](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2852), conventions also seem like a natural topic as well. (Admittedly, the topicality of clubs is also debatable, which is partly why I'm bringing it up.) It may be hard in practice to come up with a good question for this site on this topic though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it would be helpful if somebody who knows stuff about conventions would post some example questions as answers here so that we can evaluate their topicality.


















I think that we should keep an open mind on the topic, but at the same time better define the scope of these questions (which comes down to objectivity and subjectivity, the location of the poster, and interests [cosplay, doujinshi, VN, etc]). The 1st question about AMVs is off topic due to being more of a legal question, of which we have no expertise in (unless someone here is secretly or is planning to be a bar certified copyright lawyer). The second one about cosplay is considered to be a recommendation question (thus off-topic). The third one was deem to be too broad, but also very opinion-based.

Think about your audience

Think about what type of people you want to use the site. While we don't necessarily want subjective question and answer on which anime convention is the best, some more objectified question like what the largest anime/manga convention in X country can be helpful for people just getting into the anime and manga subculture.

Think about the topic

Question not on the specific topics of the events of the venue, but more about the venue locations like: "I'm going to X convention, what are some ways I can get to the site via Y mode of transportation?" should be off topic. Question about the events and topics might be more appropriate. 

"What are the major attractions/events/speakers of Z convention?," or "Who illustrated the catalog for Q convention?"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So if I asked for example: What is the largest convention in Australia?, would that be on topic Just wondering on this.


















I'm saying this from experience. When I posted https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8567/where-can-i-find-ratings-of-anime-ops-and-edsmy question about OP and ED ratings, I couldn't find an appropriate tag by searching "rating", "site" and "list". I didn't even think to look for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resourcesresources.

Here's the tag's current excerpt:


  For questions to help users find useful and valid resources that other community members may use on a variety of subjects related to the topic of the site. 


Even though it has the word "site" in it, it doesn't show up when you write "site" into tag section.

I propose to add tag synonyms https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-siteanime-site, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rating-siterating-site, and maybe https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-listanime-list so that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resourcesresources would at least show up in tag section.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Resources tag is difficult to find for new usersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I encountered the same problem. I was asking a question about where to watch animes whithout subs legally and didn't know what tag to add. Not once when asking questions like these do you think of "resources".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Although I am not a technically a new user [82 days so far and counting] and I had difficulty finding it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MiharuDante your question and Krazer's edit inspired me to post this proposition. When I asked my question, I was a 1 year user and I had this problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1306322 To be fair, this isn't a particularly serious issue, simply because we don't get many questions that merit the [tag:resources] tag. High-rep users that are aware of the tag can just edit it in when appropriate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is that there's no one-size fits all solution for this. The proposed tags synonym are a bit arbitrary and are only helpful in fringe cases. Instead, I think we need to better educate users about what non-series tags are available and how to use them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer I think it's easier to retag manually for now, and even when question rate rises, but I don't think teaching users (btw, how?) is going to be easier than adding a number of obvious tag synonyms.


















I am wondering, assuming the minimum stanard of quality was met, would a question asking to ID a Doujin be on topic? here is an example one:

I am looking for a Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Doujin i spotted while randomly searching for images on google
The pages i saw i think were at the end and of it. it shows Presea pregnant (probably in her final trimester) and Alicia with her. Presea mono-logging saying how she's going to name her new baby after Fate so it seems to hint at being after the anime where Presea made it to Al-Hazard and was able to resurrect Alicia.
I'd also want to know if it's Safe for Work (SFW) or Not Safe For Work (NSFW). if it's NSFW i'd like to know how Presea got pregnant.

If IDing Doujins are on topic, should we restrict the IDing to be be that of known series or should we also allow Original Doujins?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are ID Requests on Doujins ontopicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's okay if the question is well written and has the necessary amount of info to uniquely ID the source, but your chances of actually getting an answer are pretty much zero.


















We've had a lot of very minor tagging issues where a tag is improperly named by just a hyphen. Here's a partial list of them. I'm sure I've forgotten some, but these should be enough to demonstrate that it's a common situation.

Currently, the software catches these situations and blocks the creation of the new, correctly hyphenated tag for any users except ♦ moderators. This is typically desirable, but in the case that the initial tag is incorrect, it makes it quite difficult to correct for ordinary users. We have 2 options to do this:


Request a moderator to merge the tag into the correctly named tag. While they can do this, it can easily get missed or forgotten, and moderators have better things to do than fix low frequency tags all day.
Edit all existing uses of the tag to something completely different. Wait until 3:00 UTC for the tag deletion script to run. Retag all questions. Copy the old tag wiki onto the new tag. This requires a user with at least 4k rep to edit tag wikis, and the number of edits needed is pretty significant. I just did 26 such edits in the span of 15 minutes in order to resolve the post above with 5 cases, and I had to wait until 11 PM local time to do it.


I don't really know why it's so common for incorrectly hyphened tags to be created, but it seems to happen a lot. Any user with 150 rep can create a new tag (which is typically a good thing), but if they're just a bit off it takes a serious effort from either a concerned high-rep user or a moderator to fix. Hence, I'm requesting that some software change be made so that ordinary users can more easily fix these cases without waiting for tag deletion scripts to run.

As for exactly what change should be made, I'm relatively flexible, but one possibility would be that if a tag is only used on one question, hyphen-only edits should delete the previous tag and replace it with the new, correctly named tag and preserve the tag wiki (roughly equivalent to a moderator merging the tag). This would just accelerate what the tag deletion script would do anyway within 24 hours. It's not really prone for abuse, since it would only work on single-use tags (fixing larger tags would still require editing each question, but not waiting for a script to run). It also wouldn't ever result in a situation where hyphenated and non-hyphenated tags exist simultaneously. Since it would only work on deliberate tag edits, it would also not be prone to error the way tagging a question for the first time might be. There might be edge cases to work out e.g. if both hyphenations already exist in the system, but for the most part this seems like a simple change with little potential for abuse or mistake, but which would make fixing these recurring issues significantly easier.

Try as I might, we will not be able to read all meta posts. we are bound to miss some (I'm now following on the list of links you've put here and notice some I've missed). 

A better solution for the current time-being is to, in additionally to posting a meta post, flag a question with the 'offending' tag with a custom flag, explaining the situation and adding a link to the meta post.

We are currently overhauling our information gathering and organization ways, helping us collect the information will be extremely appreciated.

Right now, I think the preferred approach is to get a moderator's attention to fix it, for a very simple reason.

If tomorrow we'd like to change https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naru-tonaru-to, a moderator can do it on 3 clicks and a dash, while you'd need a collaboration of 10 users and several hours. Not to mention your edits bump to the first page! We don't always want that (sometimes we do, but not always).



All of the above was regarding the current state of things. 

As for your actual feature request, I think it's a good one and forwarded it up the chain.

Good evening/afternoon/morning, everyone!

As part of the improvement plan we're having as we get close to graduation, we'd like to have some feedback back from the community.

One of the decisions that we (your moderator team, Krazer, JNat, and myself) have made is to create a quarterly survey (the next one will be sent on September) to assess how things are going with the site community.

The form is powered by Google Forms, and is completely anonymous (unless of course, you'd like to tell us who you are).

We're hoping to gather as much feedback as possible, so please be honest. Even if your opinion differs from the the rest of the community does, we'd still like to know, that is the purpose of this survey.

Please be as descriptive as possible -- more detailed information will allow us to accurately assess site-wide issues and improve the community and the site as it nears graduation!

Thanks for helping out!



A note, again, since the survey is conducted anonymously, we can't really answer your question to be tailored for yourself, because we don't know who's submitting it. If you have personal questions, please ask them here on meta, but if you feel it's more of a private private, please feel free to ping https://anime.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsone of the moderators in chat and they can discuss it with you privately.

I am wondering, but since the site will be graduating really soon from the looks of it, have we decided what the design will be when we graduate?

There is a related question here on this https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/what-should-our-site-design-look-likehere, which asks what should our site look like, but have we actually decided on what it will look like and who actually decides? Is it voted on by the community, do the moderators decide? ect...

The site is owned by Stack Exchange, and as such they get to determine the design of the site. 

Because it's a community site, we get a say and like you've seen we were brainstorming on the other meta thread at the request of the Stack Exchange designer, Jin. 

Truth be told, even us, the moderators don't know what the site is going to look like, so until further announcements here on meta, we're all waiting. :-)

Last few days the review queue has been a bit buggy for me. Latest example, today I got notice of 8 review things (orange cube next to review). And after reviewing 3 First post's I had nothing left in the review tab, but the orange cube remains at 5.

Is this some sort of bug/glitch? Attempted refreshing, re-logging, clearing cache. But it kept persisting.

I apologise in advance for formatting and orthography errors that may appear here, as I am currently on mobile.

Just right now I saw a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request with the awesome title of: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9736/looking-for-the-name-of-an-anime"Looking for the name of an anime"

As some of you may know, the SE network does /questions/tagged/status-bydesignstatus-bydesign not allow duplicate titles for questions. This can be circumvented by adding additional whitespaces to the title, but that is not the issue.

What is more problematic IMO is the fact that the title is completely search-resistant, generic and totally uninteresting.

On a different site, where I am also active, the editing of titles by avid members and moderators is actively promoted. Should that also happen here, especially with ID requests, where a catchy title is the key to getting interested and knowledgeable users to read and answer the question? And how can we encourage especially new users to formulate catchy titles?

I am looking for a question or answer on Anime and Manga which answers this question I was thinking of asking which is Why do animes come out at night? I am sure there is an answer to this somewhere or a question that asks this, and I am certain that there was a question like this on this site, but I cannot find it again.

Anyone know where I can find it?

Looking at the discussion related to https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/9809/2604this answer to a question I asked raised a point for me: when is it appropriate to include images that might be under copyright? It seems that we commonly include such images when we insert screencaps (or images from manga pages) to illustrate something or give more detail.

Is it reasonable to conclude that this is reasonable behavior as long as we are doing this within some sort of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_usefair use criterion?

I've asked the following question: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9805/what-should-a-university-level-course-about-manga-and-anime-culture-cover-as-parWhat should a university-level course about manga and anime culture cover as part of its curriculum?

It is of course opinion based but I believe in this case there should be an opinion that majority can agree with and that opinion should be the answer to the question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can my question about Anime & Manga 101 be salvaged?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The key word here is opinion. SE sites are for questions that can be answered by facts, not opinions. Also, it's more of an academic field question than anime and manga.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I personally feel that there can be a objective answer to this question. It's not too different from the [anime club](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2852/63) question. I'd say it's a reasonable question, if we cite real world examples of courses offered by actual colleges/universities.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I mean it's probably not a good fit for the main site. A suitable answer could be found, but I doubt any users here have the expert knowledge on thatb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I thin that some form of this question is certainly _workable_, but practically speaking, you'll almost certainly get better results by searching for syllabi from other instructors who have taught similar courses. I don't think we have any users who academically study anime/etc., so whatever answers you get here are likely to be sort of uninformed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin, user1306322 Why do people always expect that users of stack exchange are incapable of something? I see it all the time at game exchange, where people often say: "We are not lawyers" to law questions. First, there actually can be a colledge teacher among ourselves who would be capable of creating such course. Second, there are many intelligent people in the community who know so much about anime and manga that they would certainly be able to give a good overview about what anime and manga is. If I manage to ask the question right, I am sure a good answer will follow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sm4 I'm not saying not to ask the question on the main site - I'm just warning you that you shouldn't expect too much in the way of an answer. If a good answer turns up, then great!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin "If a good answer turns up, then great!" Yes, exactly this. Now I just need to make the question answerable!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1306322 even if we don't have the experts, doesn't mean we should say it's not a good fit. We can still try to draw from other sources (reach out to the professionals or professions that have taught similar courses [e.g., Japanese Art]). I personally would like to see where this question can grow. If it works out, I think we can welcome further question of this variety, but if it doesn't it will be a testament of the unsuitability of this question and others like it. We may not be teachers, but we can still look at it from the perspective of the student.


















Personally, I think this question may have been closed a bit too quickly. It's true that subjective questions don't work as well in the Stack Exchange format as objective ones. However, that doesn't mean that no subjective questions are welcome here. There are http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/good and bad subjective questions. The bad ones tend to be a large majority on our site, but the good ones are arguably some of the most valuable questions, and shouldn't be closed. 

The close reason used was "primarily opinion based", which is not synonymous with "subjective"; a question is primarily opinion based when all answers are equally valid and there's no method to distinguish between good and bad. I think everyone here can agree that, for example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)Nausicaä and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_EvangelionNeon Genesis Evangelion are more important in the history of anime than http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buso_RenkinBuso Renkin or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Ra_No_Wo_ToSo Ra No Wo To, regardless of which of these you actually enjoyed more. There's nothing really opinionated about that.



With that said, I'm not yet going to nominate the question for reopening. As of right now, the question is rather broad. You haven't narrowed down exactly what you want. Designing a full course, complete with lectures, is obviously too broad for this site. Are you looking for just a syllabus of what sort of topics might be covered and approximately how much time will be spent on each? That could potentially work. There's a bit of opinion in which topics are more and less important, but honestly there's barely even enough time in one semester to cover the stuff that we'd all agree is important. 

What would the goal of this class be? To educate people about the general trends in anime/manga history? Or to get people to the point at which they can catch most of the obvious references in the average comedy series that airs these days? Or to understand Japanese culture better by studying the particular case of anime in depth? Also, how much anime do you expect the average student will have seen going in? Each of these would require a very different syllabus.

What format of class are you planning? Are you going to show anime during lecture? Or are you going to lecture and let people watch on their own time as "homework"? Or some combination? This is important because it determines how much time you have available to you. If you're going to be showing most of it during lecture, that limits the amount that you can cover in depth pretty severely.

There's a host of similar issues that could also use clarification. It seems like you want us to answer these, but that's where your question is getting too broad and subjective. Generally, the more you can tell us about what you want, the better your question is. If you can tell us the format and goal of the class, I think we'd be able to tell you what the major time periods and themes were. If you can address some of those points above to focus your question better, I'd consider voting to reopen it. 

Alternatively, I think the sub-question of whether there are any existing college courses on anime history is already basically fine for this site. I don't think there's more than a handful of such classes.



To make an analogy, if you asked "What should be taught in an introductory college English course?" on https://english.stackexchange.com/English SE, you'd probably get a similar response. The question is too free-form to work on a Stack Exchange site. There are simply too many options, and designing a course from scratch is too big an undertaking for a single question. But if you focused your question more, e.g. "What works of Hemingway would best show the evolution of his literary style in the context of a college freshman writing seminar?" and provided details in the question as to what broad topics you want to cover in the course, it would be a much better question (though off-topic on English SE which doesn't cover literature).

Nine months ago, a Japanese Culture proposal was started on the Area 51 meta site.

      http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/59039/japanese-culture?referrer=NYLqfxFYemeWXYyF_kRbzQ2Japanese Culture proposal @ Area 51

Recently, the proposal hit its goal of 60 followers, but our work is far from over. It is in dire need of more upvoted questions to label it a viable proposal; currently, we need at least another 22 questions with 10 upvotes to meet this goal.

We're on a bit of a tight schedule to make this proposal viable, so if you're interested in making this site happen, please help it meet its goals:


Follow the proposal!
Submit more sample questions!
Vote up questions others have written!


The Japanese Culture Q&A site proposal needs your support!


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Japanese Culture Q&A proposal is in need of support!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5At this point, it doesn't really matter all that much whether or not you follow the proposal. What **does** matter is upvoting sample questions _that have a score of less than 10_. This is priority number one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Instead of caring about other communities you should first focus on Anime & Manga so it doesn't get close by the end of beta which looks very likely since it doesn't met any of the points that define it as a healthy community if you check area51.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Prix There is no "end of beta". And yes, it has multiple stats in the "Excellent" category. We are in no danger of being closed. Regardless, I still focus a lot of time on A&M, but there is no problem with driving other communities to success as well.


















I edited the question. I am not sure if I narrowed it down enough, however this is what I want to know. If that is still to broad, then the question should be left "on hold" and closed.

Again, I'd like to ask everyone not to judge the other members of the community by saying: "nobody can answer because we are not good enough". Consider only the question form and contents in respect to the rules of the site. It's fine if the question gets not answer for long time or even never.

If we can manage to get good answer to this type of question, then I think we can allow other questions of this type... as long as the scope is specific enough.


















Following are some of the queries we've received via the survey, and would like to address. If there are any more questions, feel free to contact any of the mods via http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/chat, and we'll arrange a private room to talk if you'd like. Also, meta posts about issues are always welcome. Of course, feel free to comment on this answer as well.

I don't like there being so many identification requests

This one came up a few times. We currently have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/892/63guidelines regarding how identification requests need to be asked, any question that does not fit the bill, should be put on hold as unclear what you're asking. The rest of the questions are valid. Identification requests are a great way of discovering new anime for visitors, and we are not planning on putting them off-topic for the site.

I want anime recommendations to be on-topic on the site

We understand, however, it's problematic, because it's exactly the opposite of how Stack Exchange sites work. Someone asks a question, people post answers, and the best answer is voted to the top. That last part is where the problem lies. When you allow for recommendations, the most popular answer will be voted to the top, and not the best answer. As always, you are free to drop in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/chat and we'll give you plenty of recommendations. We're already doing it!

High reputation people hog all of the reputation

There's more than one way of getting reputation. Answering is one, asking questions is another, suggesting edits too. Don't be afraid to post what you think is a better answer even if someone already posted! Remember, we encourage multiple answers per post! An answer will be voted on if it's good, it has nothing to do with the reputation of the poster. (Don't forget that no one joins the site with high reputation, we all started from the same place).

Requiring every answer to have a source doesn't make sense

I disagree. If you post an answer, it needs to be backed up by events that actually happened in the series. If it doesn't, then it is your opinion which is also fine, but even opinions need to be backed by solid evidence and events that happened, even if the question itself wasn't explicitly explained. If you make a wild speculation that has no base, you can expect us to want to know where it came from. 

Trivial questions should be allowed

All on-topic questions are allowed. Regardless of triviality. I never met someone with that problem on this site, feel free to contact us if you feel differently.

Discourage people from voting down without a comment

I try to comment on every post I vote down, unless it's pretty obvious what's wrong with it (Lack of coherent language, one line that doesn't tell us much of the problem, expectations or demands for help, etc.) However, that cannot be enforced. Comments, as are downvotes, are a privilege, and not a requirement. We cannot force people to exert their privileges. This is not Anime & Manga policy but Stack Exchange policy.

Discourage moderators putting questions on hold without a comment.

First of all, when a question is put on hold by a moderator without a comment, an automatic flag is raised, so those occasions are rare. Secondly, don't forget that the on hold reasons themselves are comments that need to be read. Example:


  unclear what you're asking
  
  Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking. See the How to Ask page for help clarifying this question.


Sometimes, you just don't need a comment.

Because new readers of the question would get a list of recommendations backed by the complete community and not only by those individuals who frequent the chat? This would especially be helpful for people who can't even visit the chat or maybe even dislike chats.


















It would make sense to have http://manga.stackexchange.comhttp://manga.stackexchange.com redirect to http://anime.stackexchange.comhttp://anime.stackexchange.com.

The site is Anime & Manga after all.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Make manga.stackexchange.com redirect to anime.stackexchange.comb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Eh, I dunno... I guess it wouldn't do any harm, but it's also pretty unnecessary - the only people who would benefit from this would be people who type `http://manga.stackexchange.com/` into their browsers. (Contrast the case of `math.SE` vs. `maths.SE`, which is legitimately useful b/c Brits will often type the latter.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that while this wouldn't hurt anything, it also seems unnecessary. For comparison, `http://cardgames.stackexchange.com/` doesn't redirect to http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/, even though their top 3 tags are actually card games and not board games. Nor does `http://tv.stackexchange.com/` take you to http://movies.stackexchange.com/ (but, FWIW, http://fantasy.stackexchange.com does redirect). Unless there's some demonstrable use for the redirect, this is pretty low on my list of features we need.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually I think otaku.stackexchange.com would have been better than anime.stackexchange.com since it means people obssesed or who share an interest in both anime and manga,b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But otherwise I guess the redirect might be useful. But I don't see much use in it though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Well, I'm not sure the omittance of it for other sites is a strong case for omitting it here, too, especially when we don't know if it's really due to genuine reluctance for valid reasons or just due to being forgotten in those cases. Afterall, it works for [scifi.se], [unix.se] and [gardening.se], too.


















This wouldn't hurt anything, because I doubt that we'd ever have a manga.SE that wasn't this site, but I'm not certain that it would really help anything?

There's no SEO value, since the redirect is going to be to anime - so making links with it won't really do anything. Anime is just as easy to type as manga, so there's no real shortcut value there (a good example is expats => expatriates). 

Is there a more strategic reason to have it? E.g. flyers or other promotional things directed at people purely into manga, where having that specific URL would be like some extra special sauce? We'd need something to justify bugging one of the devs to set this up, beyond the sake of simply having it - did I miss another use case?

The low quality review options have me confused quiet often.

When exactly should the "looks good" option be used? When it "looks good" and issent off low quality. Or "looks good" the appropriate actions aka down vote/comments have been made?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When to use the looks good on low quality reviews?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Looks Good" effectively means "not bad enough to close/delete" - it doesn't necessarily mean that you think the post is actually _good_, just that it _isn't awful_.


















I personally believe the options could be better worded.

"Looks Good" basically means you've reviewed the post and have taken all the actions that you can do. "Skip" essentially means "I don't know what do to here, so I'll just leave this in queue for another reviewer sort out."

As for what the "Looks Good" button actually does, see https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/143469/in-the-new-review-beta-what-does-the-looks-good-button-actually-dothis question. As for how they came about, take a look at https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/147867this one.

Suppose that question X and question Y are both https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions, and suppose that it turns out that in both cases, the thing to be identified was anime Z. Should question X be marked as a duplicate of Y (or vice versa)?

For example, the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9949/a-comedy-manga-about-a-guy-who-protects-his-house-from-a-girl-that-comes-from-thhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9949/a-comedy-manga-about-a-guy-who-protects-his-house-from-a-girl-that-comes-from-th was marked as a duplicate of the earlier question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4405/comedy-manga-with-a-16-year-old-boy-from-a-poor-familyhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4405/comedy-manga-with-a-16-year-old-boy-from-a-poor-family; both questions were looking for the manga Sakuratetsu Taiwahen. In this case, the answers were the same, but the questions were different. 

Contrast this with the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6721/who-is-this-characterhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6721/who-is-this-character, which was closed as a duplicate of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4282/what-anime-is-this-winking-girl-fromWhat anime is this winking girl from? - in this case, the questions themselves were obviously the same, so I think we all agree that this closure-as-duplicate was correct and appropriate. This is not the type of situation I am talking about in this question.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we mark identification requests that turn out to look for the same thing as duplicates?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've been wondering about this too, but the one who can confirm duplicate is OP, others can only tell that this might be the same but never be sure about it. Unless it's obvious id request. Maybe we can mark as duplicate as soon as he accept the answerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5what is 'mark-as-duplicate' do actually? I always thought that this is the way community says "here's an answer and question, you're not searching it good enough" if this is the case then this shouldn't be mark as duplicate since it's impossible to search this kind of id request here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ShinobuOshino That's basically the idea - "here is a place where your question has already been answered". The problem is that marking id-requests as duplicates can't really be helpful - we only can be sure it's a duplicate _after_ OP has already accepted an answer or posted a comment saying "this is what I was looking for" or something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've wondered about this too, but yeah, the first question doesn't accept any answer, thus no way to know if it's duplicate or not. I agree with the view in the first link though. Duplicate notice says "This question has been asked before", yet they give totally different description, and "already has an answer", yet, in this one, the first one has accepted no answer yet. Well, actually, I just feel marking the second as duplicate ain't fair...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't particularly see a benefit to doing this. For ordinary questions, the reason for closing duplicates is so that the answers will all be in one place. For ID requests, before answers are accepted by the OP, there's no way to tell if they're duplicates. After they're accepted, more answers are universally either redundant or incorrect unless they contain extra information that is especially specific to the description. Hence, ID requests shouldn't be getting more late answers anyway. If others want to do this, go ahead, but I don't see it as worth our time.


















we have a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892guidelines for Identification Requests. So I thought it's better if we have same guidelines for answering those question, since there are many user who only answer it with so little information in it, so we can't tell if it's true or not unless OP clarify the answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should there be a guide to answer identification request?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I definitely agree we need some guidelines for this. The amount of 1 line name of anime is so high right now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, there absolutely should be. However, it's complicated by the fact that there are 2 very different types of ID requests: those with images/video and those with only memories. The guidelines for what constitutes a good answer for each type are very different, so we'd probably need 2 guides.


















Well I was answering a question on fairy tail which asked  Who is this green guy in fairy tail? and when I tried to include a certain link for reference as to where I copied and pasted the original it gave me this....


  Links to http://fairytail.answers.wikia.com/wiki/What_is_that_hidden_green_character_ihttp://fairytail.answers.wikia.com/wiki/What_is_that_hidden_green_character_i'm_starting_to_see_in_the_background_in_some_of_the_episodes are not allowed in a red box. See picture below.




So my question is....


What happens if I leave this link in my answer? Will I get suspended or something?
Is this like some automated thing that stack exchange has to detect bad websites?
Possibilities as to why the sites blocked/not allowed?


I have never recieved this before so much help is appreciated.

Edit: Problem solved. For some reason now I am not recieving this error anymore. I was able to post my answer with ease. Although I am not sure what happened and why I was recieving this message. Maybe someone saw my question and fixed something perhaps?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Links to http://fairytail.answers.wikia.com/ are not allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it just won't let you post the answer until you delete the link. I'm not sure why that particular site is blocked, but it could be due to a lot of low quality content. In any case, your answer seems to just be copied from the wiki over there anyway, which doesn't seem like a great answer since that site is also poorly sourced. It would be better if you can find primary sources to back up your answer rather than relying on something that someone else wrote somewhere on the internet without any accountability or verification.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM- I was definitely gonna add more content including a youtube video of all the scenes in fairy tail including when they appeared and specifically show the scene relating to the picture the OP provided and add some additional info.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was also thinking of shortening it too (The answer).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a transient issue that sometimes occurs when you paste URLs into a question or answer. I assume it's a known issue - I run into it frequently enough that I'm assuming it's been reported before. If you see this message, you shouldn't worry _unless_ it shows up again when you try to submit the post. In this particular case, it looks like your URL began with `http://http://` (that is, twice), which is what may have tripped the validator up.


















Proposal for guidelines

As stated in Logan M's comment there are 2 type's of identification there for here my proposal.

1) image of video identification.


Name of character/series
A short description of the character/series and why it is this character/series
In case of a character image and potentially link to wiki or any anime site (e.g. MAL)
In case of series link to wiki or any anime site (e.g. MAL)


2) Memory based identification


Name of the series
Why do you think so based on the description, what are the matching points.
Short description of the series
Link to wiki or any anime site (e.g. MAL)


With this there should be enough information for the OP to judge properly without having to go search around himself. And the answer itself should be off decent quality as well. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it should be link to any anime site, not just wiki since MAL and others are often use for searching anime/manga as wellb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ShinobuOshino I think any site offering information is fine indeed. I just did wiki for ease of use, if you know a beter way to state it please feel free to edit it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah MAL or anidb is rather a better option as they usually include a cover image along with pictures, and lot more information.


















I recently asked a question on pets.stackexchange.com today and it was put on hold as off-topic. The question is https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/4395/what-breed-of-cats-are-thesehere.

If it were to be migrated to anime.stackexchange.com, would it be acceptable as an on-topic question?

I had specifically asked this question on pets.stackexchange.com for obvious reasons but was not sure whether I should have asked it on anime.stackexchange.com or pets.stackexchange.com

To sum up my question, are these types of questions acceptable on Anime and Manga.SE because for me it doesn't seem to be on-topic as I am asking a specific question related to pets or real-life animal breeds in particular.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this type of question allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Those look like generic breed of cats. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_cat) has a similar looking one as an example.


















I think the question is on topic here, but the right way to phrase it and what would constitute a good answer is a bit different from on Pets SE (if they allowed the question). 

Here the best answer would be someone finding some canon source which states what breed the cats are. Barring that, we'd be stuck speculating based solely on appearances. Such an answer would not be very good in my opinion. It might be acceptable if the answerer stated that there is no canon answer but it looks like breed X, or if they found some support in the anime for their guess, but I'd probably downvote an answer which was not at least partially based on the original material. You should be careful how you phrase the question here. At the end of the day, it has to be a question about the anime, not about breeds of cats (the latter of which are not on-topic).

Personally, I very much doubt there is a canon answer to this, so I'd be tempted to downvote it as a bad question. However, I probably wouldn't close it if it were phrased appropriately for this site. If someone did come along and found a canon answer, or if you have a good reason to suspect their breeds are known canonically, then that might change my assessment of the quality of the question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The reason it's not allowed on Pets.SE is probably because of the ambiguity of the animated medium. Sure they're calico cats, but calico cats are a breed. So aside from being able to tell the coloring, it's hard to distinguish the actual breed without a canonical reference or an image of what they were based on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer As I understand it, even real pet identification questions are [at least highly discouraged](http://meta.pets.stackexchange.com/questions/410) on Pets SE, if not off-topic. Being animated presumably makes it worse, but the question may well have been closed even if it had a photo rather than an anime screencap. In any case, I don't think that them not taking the question for their reasons means that we should accept it unconditionally.


















I'm not sure how the community stands on this, but personally I would rephrase your original question of


   In Sanji's arc of One Piece, Why did Nami steal Going Merry?


to


   In chapter 68 of One Piece, Why did Nami steal Going Merry?


From a spoiler point of view

Calling the Baratie Arc "Sanji's Arc" would spoil that there will be such an important person called Sanji and therefore will probably be the new crew member. For a specific event like this, personally I would refer to the chapter number for comics or episode number for cartoons. This way people who didn't read or watch as far, would now know they don't want to click on this particular question. Numbers are a clearer reference to the relative point in time the event takes place in the story.

From a question point of view

Referring to a number might make the question unnatural, since we usually don't remember the events in every chapter. The contents of the question will obviously be explained in the body of the question with proper spoiler tags, but that might not be the community's convention.

Conclusion

Personally I would add chapter numbers for specific events, but I'm not sure how the community thinks about this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Concrete references to chapter numbers are _excellent_ and always helpful in the body of a question or answer. For the reasons you cite, though, I'm not sure they're all that helpful in question titles - they don't help the reader situate the events very effectively because, as you say, people don't remember events by chapter. For shorter series (e.g. 12-episode anime), I often refer to episode numbers explicitly, but for longer stuff (e.g. One Piece), I think it is better to use arc names or something else that helps people put the events in context.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That said, is this a case where the reference to an arc is necessary? I don't know anything about One Piece, but unless Nami steals Going Merry multiple teams, the title could just as well be "Why did Nami steal Going Merry?".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nami only once stole the Going Merry, but lets say she did so twice. What if the reader is only halfway through the story, past the first time she stole the boat. Without any time reference, the reader would think he knows the answer to the question, but might still end up being spoiled. Not sure if this situation occurs often though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, you're right, that's a good argument in favor of including arc/chapter references most of the time for long series.


















Nobody's actually annoying me or anything. It is actually this annoying thing that is happening when I click on "Leave" in a chatroom.

So I am asking in what SE would a question(with a scifi element like a mecha etc) about a manga or anime go? The anime and manga SE or the Scifi and fantasy SE? I ask this because in the scifi and fantasy SE, there are tags, such as https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga and https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime, that are actively used.

An example question would be something like this- which doesn't appear to be a scifi question.

This I know needs to be downvoted    http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/11007/what-could-be-some-of-the-problems-if-a-2001-chevrolet-cavalier-suddenly-stopped, So noone can say I am whining.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this question belongs on http://meta.stackexchange.com/ rather than a site specific meta since you're talking about a SE wide behavior.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ton.yeung It's been discussed many times on Meta SE, including most of the posts at http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/linked/135?lq=1 . No need to be sending them another duplicate. I don't see a problem with discussing it here in the context of this community, even if the resolution is the same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Personally I agree with ton.yeung on this. Wouldn't it make more sense to discuss this with everybody in the whole community instead of just us?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves As I said before, this has been discussed hundreds of times already on Meta SE; if we send it there it'll just be closed as the 250th (or so) duplicate without discussion. There is nothing more to discuss in the context of all of Stack Exchange. What's new is how *this community* specifically should treat this phenomenon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In any event, if moderators do decide to migrate it to Meta SE, I'd ask that they first delete my answer here. It was written to be specific to this community. I have no interest in speaking to all of Stack Exchange.


















Of the two examples you posted, the second (about Bleach) was posted before this site existed, so Scifi was the correct place to post it. The first was posted after we entered public beta though.

In my opinion, either of those questions would have worked on either site. They're within our scope here. They're also at least somewhat in scope on Scifi (as neither has been closed). So you're allowed to ask on either site. There's https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/626/how-do-we-handle-conflicts-with-the-anime-and-movies-sitesa meta post on Scifi regarding this, but the short version is that you're allowed to ask on whichever site you feel is likely to give the best answer. Cross-posting the same question to multiple sites is not allowed though. The same is true for overlap between this site and http://movies.stackexchange.comMovies & TV, https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Gaming, and any other network sites we may happen to share some of our scope with (now or in the future).

So, if you think your question is best answered by science fiction fans, https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/askask on Scifi. If you think your question is best answered by anime fans, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/askask here.



With that said, I suspect that for most questions about anime/manga, especially for less popular series than Bleach or Dragon Ball, this site is going to be the best option. Scifi has a few knowledgeable users about popular anime series, but here nearly every experienced user will have seen these shows. In fact, in my opinion, the big reason for creating this site in the first place was that there's a lot of anime/manga questions which require specific expertise not common among the larger communities already present on SE. The questions were mostly technically already on topic somewhere on SE, but the expertise was very fragmented. By gathering them in one place, we've created a community which is more specialized on these topics, and hence typically more knowledgeable.

To make this comparison explicit, Scifi seems to have https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime+or+bleach+or+dragonball+or+dragonball-z+or+manga+or+naruto+or+one-pieceabout 100 questions that I could find easily on anime/manga, while we have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questionsnearly 3000.

That is the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iliveunderawesomerock I think it depends on what sort of "scifi element" we're talking about. If you want to understand something which is explainable purely in-universe, I think we'll typically do fine regardless of whether the genre is scifi or anything else. If you want to know how realistic the science is in a particular series, that would usually be off-topic here, but might be allowed on scifi.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the great answer and I think I will follow the advice but it still seems like a grey area sorry.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iliveunderawesomerock It's very much a grey area. Both sites are acceptable, and there's no great way to tell which one will give you the better answer for a particular question. If you post a question on one site and it goes unanswered for a while, moderators will typically honor requests to migrate the post to a different site if you think it you'd get a better response.



















  EDIT
  
  After consulting with other moderators, I've decided to reverse my decision and remove the comments. Sorry for all the declined flags.




Obsolete comments are comments which are no longer useful in any way. Like user1306322 explained in his comment, in programming that's links to old tech which is no longer relevant.

The "Please improve" and "Improved, thanks" still hold some value in my eyes (I was the one who declined your flags). Because visitors see them and realize that improvements are possible and encouraged all over the site.

If someone were to say in a comment "Well, that's because Tobi is Madara!" even though it was revealed otherwise in both anime and manga (so it's not even spoiler anymore), that would count as obsolete. A comment or detail which is no longer relevant.


  Like always, this is my take on this. Feel free to post your own opinions and argue with me.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5_Because visitors see them and realize that improvements are possible and encouraged all over the site._ - I mean, I guess that's true, but I disagree that that's reason enough to keep the comments around. People will use comments for this purpose anyway. See also my edit to the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Uh, what? “edited, thanks” is the archetypal obsolete comment. As is “please edit” if the edit has been performed according to the comment. The revision history of a post belongs in its revision history, not in comments. Comments are for issues in a post that have not been handled yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha No problem, just wanted to get this clarified.


















I've flagged a few posts in my time here as "offensive". When comments are flagged, the option is "rude or offensive", which is relatively straightforward. But some of the answers/questions I've flagged as offensive are often what I would consider extremely rude (and generally not an answer, in the case of answers) than necessarily offensive. (I realise that this is probably idiosyncratic, to an extent.)

Thus - is flagging extremely rude, off-topic posts as offensive appropriate (particularly when such posts aren't comments, where "rude" doesn't seem to be stated in the reasons for flagging)?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What actually constitutes "offensive" posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well.. in the case of off topic, I'd just VTC. as for general rudeness.. *you* obviously find it offensive, so I don't see why you can't just flag it as offensiveb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is more-or-less answered here: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/what-are-the-spam-and-offensive-flags-and-how-do-they-work/58035#58035b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, assuming you're talking about the recent (now-deleted) answer at http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2057/is-the-nine-tails-still-stronger-than-the-eight-tails-even-though-half-of-him-wa/11318#11318, it's probably fine in that kind of case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM: yeah I was referring to that sort of thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, that answer was **not** abusive. It was low quality, but it was not abusive. The only reason I approved the flags there was because there were other flags which were correct (and I can apparently not mark individual flags are approved or declined).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha Sorry, but I disagree. "You guys are just a bunch of feeling geeks and nerd making a stupid website over some dumb anime show" can easily be construed as harassment. It's clearly phrased in a way that is "inappropriate for respectful discourse" on this site. While I wasn't offended, I don't think it would be unreasonable for someone who was to use this flag. If it is, then it's misnamed and poorly described. The -100 rep penalty is also irrelevant here since the user was a new user with 1 rep who signed up solely to post this answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I apologize. I actually did not see what the post was originally after it was edited. Theo original post deserved every single offensive flag it got. Sorry for the misunderstanding. @LoganMb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No problem @MadaraUchiha. I didn't realize it was edited, and yes, the edited version, while not an answer, is not offensive.


















Offensive flags have a very specific and narrow meaning


  it is offensive, abusive, or hate speech This question contains
  
  content that a reasonable person would deem inappropriate for
  respectful discourse.


Abusive flags, like spam flags are red flags. When you a post gains 6 of them, it is deleted, the author is penalized with -100 reputation, and its content feeds into the various anti-spam mechanisms.

Do not abuse the abusive flags (oh the irony!). When in doubt, make a custom flag.

Abusive flags should be kept for active swearing, racism, harassment, and otherwise harmful or hateful. Specifically, posts that target another user, rather than address a specific issue or question are usually abusive.

Flag constructively! -100 penalty hurts!



Note that the original answer, before it was edited, deserved the offensive flags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks - this was helpful. I assume then that extremely rude but not outright abusive posts should just be flagged as "not an answer" and downvoted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. Like I said. When in doubt, flag it with a custom flag and explain what you think is wrong with it. I tend to approve nearly all flags, even if not action needs to be taken. The exception is flags which are noise or downright incorrect.


















I just received the power to cast close votes, so I wanted to test it out on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11324/when-is-one-piece-chapter-750-coming-outthis question. It's a question where OP asks for the release date of a particular chapter, which was due the next day after a two week break. Since that day has passed and the chapter has been released, to me it felt like this question could be closed.

Before I would do so, I first wanted to verify what good reasons to closing a question would be.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When should a question be closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have you clicked on the "close" button on any post yet? It brings up a dialog box with a number of close reasons, one of which you have to select before your close vote is actually cast. Take a look through them - most of them are pretty self-explanatory.


















First of all, congratulations on your close privileges! I see that it's your first!

Closing is done when a question cannot be answered because it is too broad, unclear or primarily opinion based, or because it is off-topic on the site or was already asked (a duplicate).

If a question does not fit any of the above criteria it probably shouldn't be closed.

The above question can indeed be answered. The answer is "It has already come out, after OP was on a 2 week hiatus". So that specific question should not be closed. It should be answered (and it was).

I protected this question a couple minutes before you asked this question in order to stop people from adding pointless answers.

I've a suggestion.

We currently have the recommendation close reason:


  Questions about watching or reading recommendations are off-topic
  because they tend to attract opinionated answers and clutter.  For
  more information, see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117Should we allow recommendation
  questions?


I propose that we add an invitation to chat in that close reason:


  Questions about watching or reading recommendations are off-topic
  because they tend to attract opinionated answers and clutter.  For
  more information, see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117Should we allow recommendation
  questions? If
  you'd like, you can ask for recommendations in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/chat.


Or some similar wording.

What do you think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Inviting users seeking recommendations to chatb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The only problem I see with your current wording is that many of the users who ask these questions are 1-rep users who can't chat (unless a moderator gives them write access). I usually refrain from mentioning chat to these users or write something of the form "once you have the required 20 reputation, you can ask in chat".


















In episode 12 of selector infected WIXOSS, we find out at the end of the episode that the second cour is going to be called "selector spread WIXOSS". As such, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/selector-infected-wixossselector-infected-wixoss tag would be better off being called https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wixosswixoss, so that the tag name is generic to the whole thing. 

(I initially requested a tag migration in a custom flag because this is a trivial change that I don't think really necessitates any sort of community consensus, but here you have it. Though at this point, it would've been faster to just change the tag and copy over the wikis myself...)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Migrate [selector-infected-wixoss] to [wixoss]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this retag, but is there any particular reason you didn't just do it yourself? I don't see any reason we need to involve the mods when the tag is only on one question and can easily be fixed by any sufficiently high-rep user in a matter of a few seconds.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Well, I flagged the tag for migration by a moderator because I was feeling lazy and didn't feel like copying over the tag wikis, and whoever reviewed my flag told me to post on meta for "community consensus", so...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems like a custom flag would take longer to explain than copying a single wiki, but okay.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM In retrospect, I would be inclined to agree.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Though there is something to be said for moderators migrating tags - that preserves the edit history on the wikis, which is generally desirable.


















Overall, I'm in favor of such a change, but I suggest that we make it explicit that 20 reputation is needed to talk in chat. Otherwise, we run the risk of being even more off-putting to new users who want recommendations. Hence, I suggest we modify the wording a bit to take this into account. Here's my own (slightly awkward) attempt:


  Questions about watching or reading recommendations are off-topic because they tend to attract opinionated answers and clutter. For more information, see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117Should we allow recommendation questions? If you have https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/chatenough reputation, you're welcome to ask in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-chat.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's like to impose a quick change in wording, "If" -> "When," this way, to a new user, in won't seem like we're imposing a limit to low rep users, but rather encourage them to get more rep so they can participate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krazer I considered that. "If" is undesirable for the reasons you state. On the other hand "When" (and "Once" and every other option I could think of) reads somewhat awkwardly for users who already have 20 rep. With that said, I'm not attached to this wording at all, so if you think that's an improvement then go ahead and change it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How about, "After earning enough reputation, you're welcome to ask in chat."? It's slightly less awkward to those who have achieved it already, I think.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe something like "More information on [how to increase your reputation]()" should be added at the end too. People who don't know about the reputation requirement to get into the chat, might not even know how the reputation system works at all.


















Since an official answer seems somewhat unlikely, I'm expanding my comment to an answer.

A site reaches "critical mass", according to SE, when the site exhibits a normal growth pattern of users, steadily increasing traffic, and has enough incoming questions to sustain its community. At that point, it's clear to them that the site is in no serious danger of becoming a ghost town. There's also a quality aspect to the evaluations; generally, they want to see that the questions and answers being posted here are high quality compared to other resources which are available.

Based on this metric, we are apparently ready for graduation, and in fact have been for some time. But so are quite a few other beta sites. Of course, our status is assuming nothing has changed, but I'm fairly confident that if there were a major problem that would prevent this we'd hear about it from one of the community managers.

So, at this point, we could graduate essentially any time. With that said, the only real changes that will happen are moderator elections, higher rep levels for privileges, a new site design, and a few miscellaneous things. Of these, the one that takes the most time is the site design. It's hard to say how many sites are ahead of us in the queue or how long each one will take, so it's impossible to give a good estimate from our end when this will happen. But there's no serious risk of this beta being shut down or failing.

Since the ball is now in SE's court (so to speak), there's nothing more we need to do here. Just keep asking/answering questions well, and graduation will happen when it happens. However, if you do want to prepare (this is not particularly necessary), the most significant change functionally will be new higher rep levels. https://academia.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesHere's the levels on the most recent graduated site; ours will be the same (barring any unusual circumstances). Most of them are significantly higher than https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesour current levels. Having more users with the important privileges (e.g. Edit freely (2k), Close votes (3k), Moderator tools (10k), Trusted User (20k)) will make that transition smoother, so this would be a good goal to set for yourself. See https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/865/are-we-really-ready-for-graduationAre we really ready for graduation?, but note that this isn't as serious of an issue as I made it seem there.

When reading old questions, whether it be through search engines or linked questions, sometimes dead links are encountered. For example https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/232/6166this question linked to http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/36782/clothing-and-fashionhttp://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/36782/clothing-and-fashion, which has gone down since it was posted almost two years ago.

I thought of several actions which could be done, but none seemed like a proper way of dealing with them.


Deleting the link would remove possibly essential material from the answer.
Editing the link might not always be possible by a bystander.
Commenting on a two year old answer, might also not be appropriated, bumping old questions. Also, the answer's OP might not even be around the Anime SE any more.


So what would appropriate action be when such a situation occurs?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should appropriate action be towards link rot?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be clear, are we talking about link rot here on meta, or on the main site? On meta, I'm relatively unconcerned with this. On the main site, it is a potentially serious issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I guess I was asking for the main site. I just noticed the problem on meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Commenting on a question does not bump the question. Editing the answer does.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say you should add the context implied by the link if you know what it is. This should be possible if the web archive has a copy of the page.


















Yes. There are exactly two possible cases with these images:


Either the image can be found with Google reverse search, in which case, there should be a canonical to close as duplicate against.
Or it can't, in which case there are not enough details to answer the question, and it should be closed as "unclear".


In both cases, image only identification requests are not good questions to answer.

What should be done in that case? If I know the answer, should I reply or flag regardless? Like this question for example http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11567/what-anime-are-these-two-images-fromb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I would do is answer it and also vote to close it, like what I did with this Q http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4129/what-are-all-the-cross-references-in-binbo-gami-ga/4148#4148b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This isn't my experience. I've answered a bunch of questions like this, and I've often found that Google image search gave *incorrect* results or no relevant results at all. That absolutely doesn't mean there aren't enough details to answer the question; more than half of the  anime I've identified didn't require Google at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agree with @LoganM. Also, could you clarify what you mean by "there should be a canonical to close as duplicate against"? I mean, maybe that'll be the case at some point in the far future, but for the time being, there are far more identifiable things than there are [tag:identification-request] questions, so we clearly won't have a canonical duplicate for _everything_b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You know speaking of Google Image Search I would have rather used imageraider or tineye. Imageraider is far more useful in my opinion than google image search when looking for hard identification requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also I don't really agree on this @Madara sorry.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is my take. It's all nice in theory but this is what I see on the field. If you have a better opinion, vote this one down and post your own! This is meta after all!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the [question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11567/what-anime-are-these-two-images-from) Peter Raeves links to is an unusual case where the answer to the question is useful information for not only the OP but also for others (including fans well-versed in that series), as the image in question is an arguably confusing one (it's from a non-canonical crossover film produced by the official animation company). As such, to answer it & simultaneously vote to close would be the opposite of helpful to general users. Rather, editing the question title can make it no longer "unclear"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@seijitsu If you can edit the question to make it clearer (thus removing the need to close it), it's always better. With identification requests in general (and especially ones that only have an image in them), that's almost always not possible.


















This discussion is motivated by https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11561/sad-anime-about-a-poor-boy-and-his-doghttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11561/sad-anime-about-a-poor-boy-and-his-dog. 

Now, as we all know, Stack Exchange policy https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/self-answerencourages self-answered questions. However, before we apply this policy blindly, we should be careful to consider why this policy exists. According to the help center, 


  If you have a question that you already know the answer to, and you would like to document that knowledge in public so that others (including yourself) can find it later, it's perfectly okay to ask and answer your own question on a Stack Exchange site.


Here is the thing: self-answered questions are great when ― and only when ― they provide useful knowledge to future readers. However, as previous discussions have already established, identification-request questions are generally not useful to future readers, since no two people will remember a given anime in the same way. As such, I am not really sure that the standard rationale for permitting immediately-self-answered questions really applies here. 

Please note that I am not saying that users should not be able to self-answer an identification-request if they later find the answer to their question; this discussion is strictly about cases where the OP knows the answer at the time they ask the question. While I grant that in practice, it is not 100% possible to distinguish between these cases (OP could always pretend not to know the answer and then post it some hours later), it may be productive to discourage the asker-already-knows-the-answer questions anyway (provided that we come to the conclusion that these questions should not be allowed).

(The purpose of this post is not to impugn the asker of the question linked above, but rather merely to come to a consensus about these questions for future reference.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow identification-request questions where the questioner already knows the answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's probably gonna be fine in case where the description is along the lines of how an average person would describe it. Which is  somewhat difficult to ascertain beforehand, but is not impossible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see the problem with this unless you are concerned that he is trying to harvest rep (which it doesn't seem like it). If he was doing it consecutively one after the other then I guess but I don't see why it should not be allowed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@アズーサ Frankly speaking, I was trying to introduce an anime/movie that I enjoyed watching very much, to the community. So this question could be changed accordingly. I have been introduced to a couple of interesting mangas through the set of questions asked here before, so I though I'd try and contribute in the opposite direction, since recommendations can't be asked for in general.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves That's a perfectly fine motivation for asking a question; I just think that a better way of doing it is to ask and (possibly self-answer) a question _about_ the series (see e.g. nhahtdh's question about Koe no Katachi: http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3731/1908). That way, you still bring more eyes to the series while also increasing the odds you answer a question somebody else also had.


















I disagree that we should dismiss them as "not useful to future users."

While yes, by nature, identification requests will be helpful to fewer people, there are still people who benefit from them. Take, for example https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/810/274this answer of mine, which still continues to receive occasional upvotes, and which has a comment from a second user who was looking for the same anime. While this is the only concrete example I have, I think it's fair to say it's a possibility for all (good) requests. (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3617/274This question also gets occasional upvotes, but that may just be because it's about lolis.)

And, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11561/sad-anime-about-a-poor-boy-and-his-dog#comment14193_11561as Oded said,


  so long as both question and answer conform to our quality guidelines, what's the problem?


So, in short, I think identification requests, asked when the OP already knows the answer, are perfectly acceptable.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For me I find it a bit awkward so I don't really do it that much. Lol.


















I disagree with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1035Madara's answer claiming that there are only two possible ways to answer identification requests. This seems like a drastic oversimplification, to the point that it's factually incorrect. Most of this post is intended as a reply to that line of thinking. For my answer to this question, see the last paragraph. 

To put it simply, I rarely use Google image search simply because it's rarely the best tool for the job. To make an analogy to programming, if for loops are the only form of loops you've ever used, you'd think they're sufficient, but better programmers know that there are lots of different types of loops which have different use cases. I'm sure that for some users here, Google image search is the only tool they use regularly to ID images, but with that you're really only getting the easy ones, and often times not getting as much as you could be.



To give several examples from my history where Google image search was either unnecessary or unhelpful (feel free to skip to the conclusions if you prefer):


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4236/which-anime-is-this-woobie-taken-from/4237#4237Which anime is this woobie taken from?


In this question, Google image search turned up 0 relevant results at the time I was searching. It didn't answer the question. However, there are steps you can use to answer it. First, looking at the style of the image, it's likely that this is not from an animated medium. The quality is too high and the style is different. It looks like a typical VN CG.

In fact, I'd seen images of the same characters before, though only a couple more pictures. But based on that, I was able to figure out through Anime Characters Database that the girl was http://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/character.php?id=2287this character. Browsing a few CGs it was enough that I was convinced it was the same. Later I was able to go back and confirm this and identify which VN in the series it was. Google image search literally never helped with this.


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5443/what-is-this-anime-or-manga-about-leben-nicht/5446#5446What is this anime or manga about "Leben Nicht"?


For this one, you could have gotten the right answer through Google...if you cropped the image to just the upper right panel and then waded several pages of results (all in Japanese) before finding the artist's pixiv profile (also in Japanese), and then browsed that to find the original image.

Instead, it was faster to just do an ordinary Google search for "leben nicht site:pixiv.com". This took me to a different image of the same character, but that pointed me back to the original artist. Still needed to know Japanese, but that's unavoidable in answering this sort of question. Google image search was just not helpful, though you could have made it work if you were desperate.


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11287/identification-request-what-the-flute/11298#11298https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11287/identification-request-what-the-flute/11298#11298


This one is pretty well documented on my answer itself, and not a great example since I didn't even succeed, but it's at least evidence that Google isn't the only tool here. The first thing to do was to do a Google image search to find the highest resolution copy of the same image, but that's where Google's usefulness ends. The image was simply on too many "Free Anime Wallpaper" sites to show up with anything remotely useful. However, the full resolution image confirmed suspicions from the small image that this was photoshopped. Incidentally, if you thought to flip the image and then went to page 24 (for me) of the Google image search results, you would have found a link that would eventually lead to http://e-shuushuu.net/image/473312/this post on e-shuushuu. More specifically, it took me to an e-shuushuu search page which was cached, and going a couple hundred images in you would have gotten to this image. I only discovered this after I'd already found that image page through other means. This sort of thing is often highly dependent on your search history and location and changes regularly, so it's not a good idea to rely on it.

To find the original image, I went on an image board and just searched for images of girls with flutes and purple hair and head ornaments. After a few dozen images, I managed to find the original one (posted in the answer). That gave me the artist's name. Cross-referencing a different image board (which had other images by the artist but not this one) was enough to get me to the artist's Pixiv page and Wikipedia page. Exhaustively checking that it wasn't from anything listed on Wiki was enough to confirm my suspicions based on the image's style and resolution that it wasn't from any anime, though I still wasn't able to locate the original. But this was at least enough to write an answer, and for the reasons I stated in my answer going farther would be hard here.


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9634/where-is-this-girl-in-a-maid-uniform-holding-a-cat-from/9637#9637Where is this girl in a maid uniform holding a cat from?


In this case, Google image search didn't give anything useful. However, I happened to already know the source in question. Based on that information, I was able to locate the original uncropped version of the picture. Google image search for the uncropped image did give me a few nice facts to put in my answer, but they weren't necessary to answer the question. Even if I hadn't known the source, I could have still found it just based on what I could see from the picture by going to an image board. Note that for me it now shows the full image under the "related images" section, but this was not true at the time and may be partly due to my answer.


Offsite example


This is one example from several years ago (before this site existed), but I figured I'd share it since it's quite different from anything else here. One of my friends had a hard copy of a certain piece of fanart of a character. We knew the character, but not the artist. I scanned his image, but Google didn't give any results. But since we knew the character, I could just download every (high quality) image on Pixiv with that character with a program. I then ran that archive together with the scanned copy through a duplicate checking program, and sure enough it found the duplicate which pointed back to the original artist. Sure, anyone could have done that, but it's at least evidence that Google isn't the only useful tool.


Several other cases


In at least five other cases, I've simply had no use for Google image search, though it may have given the correct answer. For instance, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4321/what-anime-is-this-image-of-a-girl-caressing-a-skeleton-from/4322#4322in this question I knew the answer immediately. It didn't require Google. I eventually did a Google search, but the only additional thing I learned from it was additional places that the image was used. In https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6502/can-anyone-tell-me-what-anime-this-nekomimi-girl-is-from/6504#6504this case, I knew the answer without any Google searching. It turned out that appropriately cropping the image, one could get some relevant results with Google. In https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4122/what-manga-is-this-image-with-a-depressed-girl-from/4123#4123this case, I again answered without Google image search, and later used Google to figure out exactly what page of the manga the image was from. Sure, in all of these cases, Google alone could have given the answer, but it was simply faster to just know it. Here's https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3617/from-what-series-is-this-odd-lolicon-poster/3618#3618an example where I answered in under a minute; if you think you could beat that by Google image searching, you're almost certainly mistaken. I could give more examples to this effect, but I don't really think there's room for debate at this point.



So no, it isn't just a matter of "Google or nothing". There are plenty of other ways to identify a series. If you didn't realize this, that's probably why I was able to answer these questions and you weren't. But I'm far from the only user here who has answered ID requests which didn't appear on Google. I'm quite certain that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11269/what-anime-does-this-pic-come-fromthis image had no results on Google when it was asked. I know because I tried it myself. The same is true for at least most frames of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8802/who-is-this-and-what-show-is-it-from/this gif. That doesn't mean they aren't answerable; the answers were found.

Also, it's worth pointing out that if your idea of a good answer is just "Google and copy the title", that's not what a good answer means in this case. There's plenty more that you can say about an image apart from just the title of the series. Some of these are things that you can find via Google (e.g. characters, artist). Some are things you can't (e.g. at what time a screencap occurred in an anime). But in general, answers here should be informed and contain as much information as possible, not just the stuff Google gives you for free. That's true not just for ID requests, but for all questions on this site. If the best you can do is copying from some other site, it's not a very good answer. We should be striving to do better than other sites, not copy their content.

As for asking the OP to provide more information, e.g. where they found the image, this is sometimes of use. But often it's unnecessary. If they found it on a friend's facebook wall, I'm not going to try to get in contact with their friend to ask what it's from. I doubt anyone else is either. We have better methods of IDing images than relying on someone's friend. Not that I mind such content being added, but if there's already an image present, I don't see any reason to mandate it. It might help in 20% of cases, but 80% of the time it's basically irrelevant. That doesn't seem like a good thing to determine the fate of questions on.

We should continue to allow these questions because there's simply no reason to ban them. If they're easy to answer with Google image search, then answer them. If you don't feel like it, then don't. If you think that the OP didn't do enough research before asking here, downvote. But there's no good reason to close them. And especially for the images where Google fails, these absolutely shouldn't be closed. Such questions are certainly challenging to answer, but that doesn't mean they're unanswerable. They aren't "unclear" at all; you know exactly what the OP wants, but you just don't know the answer (because Google doesn't know the answer and apparently you're incapable of beating a machine). They have answers, and if people here are smart enough and knowledgeable enough we'll eventually find most of them. Closing is for questions which will just not work in this format, either because they aren't questions at all or because they're too subjective. Closing is absolutely not for questions just because they're difficult. If we're going to start closing hard questions, we might as well ban every anime with fewer than 100,000 viewers on MAL, because the chance that anyone here will know the answer is low.

To be honest, I don't watch the whole Fate series so I don't really know how to deal with this, but watching Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero, it seems like these are two separate series set in the same universe since Fate/Zero is a prequel for Fate/stay night.

And I want to add some detail in the tag wiki for fate-series, so before I do that, I want to make sure whether this tag should be one tag or not.

And now we have four Fate tags: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fate-stay-nightfate-stay-night https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fate-zerofate-zero https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fate-extrafate-extra and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fate-kaleid-linerfate-kaleid-liner.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the Fate series become one tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Probably not. From what I've read about them, they're all different despite having similarities. Something like Final Fantasy perhaps. Anyway, they have different titles, so it's probably better to let them have different tags in long term.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yeah I thought so, I just want to make sure, but fate zero and fate stay night are same despite they have different title, and from what I watch, fate kaleid is different, I don't know about the othersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this case it's still better to keep different tags so you don't have to explain why 2 series share 1 tag and the rest have their own tags, when they all have a common name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5perhaps a "nasuverse" for general Type-Moon and Nasu Kinoko related series?

As they are now, the Dragonball tags are


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball == https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonball-zdragonball-z
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-gtdragon-ball-gt


DB being a synonym for DBZ feels rather inconsistent because DB and DBZ are completely different parts of the DB story. So it might be that some readers/viewers don't know about this and refer to DBZ as just DB as it's global name (and this was probably the reason why they became a synonym?), but then why isn't DB-GT a synonym of DB too? Since this too would then be part of the DB franchise, wouldn't it?

I just noticed that there was a previous discussion about this https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/212/should-we-have-separate-tags-for-the-dragon-ball-seriesShould we have separate tags for the Dragon Ball series?. Here it seems that the conclusion was indeed to either drop both DBZ and DBGT or make DB a synonym for both. Was there a reason this didn't happen or did people just forget about it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are the Dragonball tags inconsistent?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did you notice [this comment](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/212/should-we-have-separate-tags-for-the-dragon-ball-series#comment439_215) in the post you linked?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア I did, but didn't give it much thought. I just verified and it was indeed independent. I never knew DBGT wasn't based on any manga either. Coming from the anime, it just looked as if there were three parts in the story. Well then I guess in a way it makes sense not to have them as synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's true that the Dragon Ball manga covers Dragon Ball and DBZ but not GT, and that's why we have a separate tag for GT. However, to what degree that's actually needed and useful is a different story. I think a good argument could be made for merging them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about Dragon Ball Kai? Does that share the dragon-ball tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM To be honest if I'd like to browse through all dragonball questions I would expect DBZ questions to be included aswell as DBGT questions. Not sure how Kai fits in this but I would expect DB-kai == DB. Also would the synonyms be transitive? I mean if DB==DBZ and DB==DBGT would that mean if you search for DBZ questions you would also find DBGT questions? Or wouldnt you, because those are not explicitely made synonyms? If its the former I'd vote for merge. if its the latter I'd only vote for them to be synonyms regardless of the independence. Movies are independent too but still included.


















Recently I edit some wiki tag, usually I give a picture, English title, Japanese title, other title, production detail, plot, and some link to wikipedia, wikia.

I'm not sure if I should also add detail like list episode, chapter, character, link to MAL or others, and genre or references.

There's also a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/431/2869guideline for images in tag wikis by @LoganM that say there should be only one picture, but sometimes I think I should add picture from both anime and manga or light novel (if exist) since it sometimes kinda different.

so to summarize my question, what is the best way to fill wiki tag?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What kind of details should be in tag wikis?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a practical consideration: basically nobody reads tag wikis (as opposed to excerpts), so it honestly doesn't really matter too much. This is sort of a structural defect in the way the whole tag wiki system is designed. It's useful for some large tags on Stack Overflow (e.g. the programming languages) but for our site, tag wikis serve no real purpose that I can see.



















A nice big illustration showing the main characters;
Work type − anime series / movie / short / OVA / ONA / manga / novel / light novel / one-shot, etc;
Work names − official English and Japanese titles, alternative titles, short titles;

Genres − preferrably combined from several sources like Wikipedia, MAL and such;
Plot summary − short description of what it's all about, preferably original;

Personally, I'd like to have a Wikipe-tan-style mascot, but I could see that being off-putting to some users, as Logan M. says in his answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda The existing well known anime mascot (Windows-tan, Inori, Miku) are not trying to pleased everyone. Because casual fans probably don't care much about mascot, all they want to see is their favorite anime character (Be it Naruto, Luffy, or Goku) and not much else. But 'hardcore' otaku watch lot more anime therefore they didn't really care about which series and more likely to accept general mascot. And these anime fans usually love to see 'moe' cute anime girl. And so, Windows-tan, Inori, Miku are born. If we want to pleased everyone, we need several mascot, or there will be no mascotb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we really want a mascot, we should forget about pleasing everyone, that's not gonna happen


















This is just my viewpoint, but here's why I think we're pretty much doomed to fail with the current approach.

Anime & Manga encompass a lot of different genres. We're trying to be the Q&A site to cover everything. There are going to be people on this site with absolutely no common interests. That's fine, everyone is welcome here. However, when it comes to something like a mascot, we definitely need something that is at least going to not be off-putting to anyone. I spent a lot of time trying to design a mascot myself which everyone would find acceptable, but in the end I'm sure that it wouldn't get anywhere near a consensus, so I didn't bother posting it. In any case, the best we'll be able to come up with is likely something that is inoffensive to everyone. An answer at +2/-0 for something like this is a lot better than one at +10/-5. But that's certainly still far from a consensus.

So what you're seeing over on that other post is simply the fact that this is a very opinion-based matter. There's no mascot proposal that is universally supported. And it's going to be very hard in this format to build a consensus. Meta is still a Q&A site, and we aren't going to be able to get around that.

The other thing is that we were never really sure what the mascot would be for. Is it going to be used in the finalized site design? If so, we definitely don't want anything biased towards one particular group. But also, we're not the ones who design the site. SE's design team does that. So they'd be the ones making the final decisions on a lot of things. If it's not going to be part of the final site design, we have more freedom there, but what are we going to use the mascot for? We could use it to promote the community pages, but if so there's really no need for a broad consensus anyway because those pages are run by individual users. 

So in reality, there doesn't seem to be any real use for a mascot. And to be honest, I'm not sure why we need one anyway. It would be kind of cool I guess. That's why I suggested it (and several other users had the same idea at different times). But it isn't something we really need. Other sites like MAL, ANN, etc. don't have mascots that I'm aware of. If they do, they're pretty much unknown and neglected.

If we are going to get a mascot, it will have to be done organically, e.g. in chat. A request for proposals on meta isn't going to reach a consensus.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Same logic could have gone for the chat room naming, though the chat room is admittedly not quite the same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DavidStarkey The chat room was for over a year just called "Anime & Manga Chat" or something like that. The regulars in the room eventually decided this wasn't acceptable, partially because it lacked character and partially because it made chat and main-site tabs indistinguishable. We spent several weeks in chat discussing various suggestions, and after a while the current name emerged as the most popular choice. Only after that was [the new meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/789/) made. We didn't really build the consensus on meta in that case.


















There was a big push to clean up a lot of the main site tags, but the meta tags are in a bad state aswell. I'm finding a lot of overlap, maybe a moderator can take a look at these?

/questions/tagged/acceptable-questionsacceptable-questions → /questions/tagged/allowed-topicsallowed-topics

/questions/tagged/close-reasonsclose-reasons → /questions/tagged/closed-questionsclosed-questions

/questions/tagged/editingediting → /questions/tagged/editoreditor

/questions/tagged/taggingtagging → /questions/tagged/tagstags

/questions/tagged/votingvoting → /questions/tagged/votesvotes

I'm also not sure what /questions/tagged/specific-questionspecific-question is meant to be

[or vice versa for most things]

There's a couple more that are a bit redundant, but those were the main ones I saw
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Meta Tag Cleanupb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[meta-tag:tagging] is already syn'd to [meta-tag:tags] per this post: [(link)](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/719/1908). Regarding that and also `voting`/`votes`, related [meta.se] feature request: [(link)](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/234473/224428). [meta-tag:specific-question] is typically used (at least on other sites) for things like "why was this particular question closed?" or "should we deem this particular question off-topic?".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[meta-tag:editor] should be for questions about the Markdown editor (I've added a wiki excerpt), while [meta-tag:editing] should be for questions about the task of editing itself (e.g. when do I edit; is this edit appropriate; etc.). They probably shouldn't be syn'd.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[meta-tag:scope] should also be syn'd to [meta-tag:allowed-topics] (or vice versa - "scope" is a default tag on child metas, but it's a terrible name for a tag, so I favor "allowed-questions" anyway).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5cool that clears up a couple of em :)


















This is because the scope of the question was worded to ask about what it meant in context with the anime. So therefore it's on-topic. Though it is a question about the English language, it's more so about the context of the situation in anime, therefore it is on-topic here. If what was simply asked was simply "What does the expression 'show me you guts' mean?" without the Naruto anime as context, it might be on-topic for ELL. A good answer to this question would tie the context into it's answer.

The only reason the HxH question was labeled as off-topic, was because it only asked for what the kanji meant in Japanese, rather than why Netero you see this kanji associated with him, in addition to what it meant.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also worth mentioning that neither [ell.se] or [english.se] wanted it.


















Many new users post "I want more anime like XXX" and it's closed forever as off-topic. But instead of diluting correctly tagged question count with these, let's just retag them to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/recommendationrecommendation and add a warning that these kinds of questions are off-topic, along with a "welcome to chat" message, so that 20+ rep users can avoid posting a useless question, waiting for someone to come by and invite them to chat by manually posting the same comment over and over. 

Solves 2 problems:


Users get their recs and faster;
Less tags used on forever closed questions.


What do you say, community?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retag recommendation questions to reduce misused tag countb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't feel that creating a tag that will never be used, except as a warning, would be the most efficient way of handling this situation. I mean if they're not going to read the tour or the check what's [on-topic](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic), what's to say they're even going to read the tag excerpt.


















This seems like a bad idea to me. Making a tag to be used for entirely off-topic questions will just enable people to ask those questions easier.

Recommendation requests are typically closed very quickly anyway. If they have a net negative vote record and no answers, they'll be deleted automatically anyway after 30 days. That's short enough that it doesn't really dilute the count of bad questions in any given tag significantly. Users with enough reputation for the moderator tools privilege (currently 2k) can accelerate this by casting their own delete votes on the question 48 hours after it's posted, which will also deal with the rare case that it has answers. If the post reaches -3, trusted users (currently 4k) can bypass the 48 hour restriction and vote to delete immediately (and moderators can always delete), but this kind of deletion isn't particularly urgent in my view.

If the question sits at a net score of 0, it will be deleted after a year, and if it has a positive score the automatic deletion script will never delete it. In a case like this, when the question is clearly and completely off-topic and the OP didn't read the rules, downvotes are merited, so these questions should always get deleted.

Deleting these questions should be our ultimate goal. Making a new tag to move them to only to have them be deleted soon after seems like a lot of work (it will need to be recreated frequently or we'll need to use a hackish workaround like what we did with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag) and I'm not sure I see a lot of benefit. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alrighty then, just downvote and leave for automatic deletion it is.


















Let's start fresh

Let us take a moment and start a fresh conversation about the value of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions to our community. Let's start with a fresh, clean slate with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions. While they are popular... do they really contribute to the site and community?

Before we make a decision, let's take a look at some data points from the SE Data Explorer...

Let's take a look at the http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/161411/site-activity-and-votegraph#graphsite activity and vote graph.

What is it that we see here? Clearly we have a lot of unanswered questions (zombies).

Poor zombies... they're being neglected and could use some slaying.

What's causing these zombies?

Let's take a look at the http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/172449/tagged-zombie-timeseries?Weeks=52&TopTags=15#graphtotal unanswered question history by tags.

What do we see? Why our old friend, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request!

The amount of question does seem troubling, but what about the quality of those questions?

Let's take a look at the data for http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/160176/average-score-for-questions-and-answers-by-tagquestion and answer score by tags. (Sort them the amount of questions, descending.)

Even compared to the most popular tag, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, the average score for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request is disappointing.

From this data, we see that our community tends to have a polarization towards specific series tags, much like programming languages on Stack Overflow. This along with our various meta tags like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cultureculture and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production are valuable to our community for the content they provide.

But what about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request? Do these questions contribute anything valuable and worthwhile to our community? Do they attract so-called "help vampires" that plague much of the Stack Exchange network of sites (especially Stack Overflow)?

I personally believe that the current state of identification questions diminishes the value of the site to the average user. If things continue at this pace, our site might be flooded with mostly unanswered or low-quality https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions. 

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions are typically easy to ask, topically neutral and initiated by new users. But is this a good thing or a bad thing?

Robert Cartaino brings up a convincing point about these types of questions in https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/a/75Movies and TV SE meta.


  In a not-too-distant future, most of those questions will be asked by hit-and-run users who will never return to this site. And you'll get bored having to tease out a decent question and provide answers to a post that will not add one lick of value or interest to this site.


If you go through unanswered https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions, you'll notice a good portion of them to be don't seem to have much response from the OP as the age of the question increases. 

Have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions helped us attract new returning users? Are there many good identification request questions that got you interested in this site or a particular series?

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on the topic of the value of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request to our community. Give us good examples, bad examples, or those in between. This is an important topic of discussion and should warrant more attention. If possible spread the word on current and new https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions, to attract more attention to this discussion.

Now what do you think?

I have given you my opinions, so please take some time to consider the topic and give your thoughts. You're free to agree, disagree, or be undecided. You're an important part of this community, regardless of how much or how little reputation you have. Your opinion matters because it lets us know how you feel and what kind of experience you would like.

I'm not necessarily saying all https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions are bad, nor that we should get rid of all of them. I'm suggesting that we should perhaps be more stringent on the quality of these questions. The human memory can be very unreliable (witness testimonies are a good example of this), especially when a fair amount of time has passed. Your memory might be affected by current trends, media, or even your day to day, if you're going by just memory alone, unless you never forget anything, you'll probably be missing bits and pieces. 

For an example, if I'm trying to remember http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oruchuban_Ebichua certain ecchi/dirty joke anime series about an office lady and her talking hamster, Ebichu. I might confuse the characteristics of Pikachu and Ebichu, and because they share similar characteristics, being mousy and cute animal creature. I might mistake Ebichu as being yellow or have stripes, because I watch the anime regularly. If I give such an erroneous description to someone trying to help me the mismatch actually makes it hard for that person to find the series since they're going to be looking for a yellow hamster.

This discussion will be open awhile to garner more attention feedback, so take your time. If you feel that you have a better solution, feel free to post your suggestion as an answer. 

As a side note, the discussion primarily focuses on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request as a standalone tag. Whether or not we should be tagging questions about identifying a specific reference in a specified tagged series (e.g, who is being parodied in X series in Z screenshot) should be left for another discussion.

tl;dr: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions are not of good quality (by nature), piling up, they don't seem to actively contribute to user retention. A complete ban on such types of questions seem counter-intuitive as there have been some good questions, but the bad ones seem to be spoiling the rest of the bunch. If you're indifferent about these types of questions, it's probably because you don't feel that they actively contribute anything, unlike the series tags or meta tags like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it feasible to keep "identification-request" questions going as they are now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just recently asked a [question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13076/what-is-the-cover-of-reset-chapter-2-a-reference-to) about a reference to another series within a series. I tagged it identification request by analogy to [this question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4127/who-are-these-characters-referenced-in-chapter-4-of-spotted-flower) and [this question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4764/what-series-does-index-tan-refer-to). Are we including questions like that in this discussion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont'd) I'd like to argue that that kind of question is different from the "I saw this series five years ago and it had this guy with spiky hair and a girl with big breasts help plz!" kind of question. Other users who didn't get the reference can come along later and make use of the answers to such a question. For the most part, series identifications mostly help the OP, and maybe not even them if they run off and never return.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You bring up a good point. I believe Id-request questions with a known source series to be perfectly legitimate, it's the standalone Id-requests that seem troubling.


















There are currently 440 questions asked with this tag, with 57 unanswered.
Naruto, as you have mentioned, has 407 questions, but only 8 are unanswered.

As you mentioned, we are polarised towards series specific tags and Naruto also has a large fan base in A&M so I feel this is a slightly unfair choice.

So taking a different question tag, like anime-production (132/11) or Tropes (92/5) which are also non-series specific - we can see percentagewise that we are not far off the ~11% unanswered that identification requests has.

On Area51, it says that a healthy beta is 90% answered rate, so ideally that's what I'd like to aim for with these, and its not too far off it

There are a multitude of issues with these questions


Generally not as interesting to answerers. No identification requests normally exceed any significant upvote count. I don't think this will change regardless of rules enforced
Identification requests have a much larger scope. Naruto consists of several media types, but identification requests could be targeting an individual scene in one out of every anime ever. This means this questions can be very hard to answer, and I think this is a large contributing factor to the unanswered stat
It probably does attract zombie users, but as long as they're here I don't think there's much to do to mitigate that


I think the rules defined https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions?rq=1earlier in the year are on the right track and don't need immediate rework, maybe we need to be more strict with closing questions that don't fit the requirements though 

I personally don't like the questions, but they serve a useful purpose and I still think we should keep them, as long as it does not overtake the site.

TL;DR: I think the rules we have in place are adequate, we have closures for under defined questions, perhaps maybe we should be more stringent if it is getting out of hand
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To support the claim here that ID requests aren't really significantly hurting our answer rate, our current answer rate is 87.70%. If we removed every question from the site tagged [tag:identification-request] right now, it would indeed increase our rate...all the way to 87.80%. We'd only gain 0.10%, which is not even measurable by [Area 51 metrics](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/31538/), and corresponds to about 3 total unanswered questions sitewide. We'd gain somewhat more by removing every question tagged [tag:nanoha] (gain of 0.18%) or [tag:speed-grapher] (0.13%).


















In my opinion the main reason so many ID requests are unanswered or with no answers is due to the fact that users who ask these types of questions are 'no shows' and often don't return back to the site to accept the answer and simply because this sites majority only like/have knowledge in areas such as Naruto, Fairy Tail and other popular tags and anime series or image only identification requests because of Google's, yes, annoying Reverse Image Search.

To me reverse image search is likely to get a new first user a -1 or a -2 on an image id request due to how easy it is to find what anime it is from just a 'right click on picture' in Google Chrome or a 'upload picture by URL' on iexplorer, Google. Personally I tend to upvote. There's nothing worse than just getting a -1 straight away. Also image identification, whether they are easy to find or not hardly get upvoted anymore. The most you might get is if it is a moe picture and that will be +5 max. I was surprised to see how many ID requests (image only) and other identification requests got +11 and even more and the answers got ridiculous + 15 - +20 in some cases last year and even nearing the end of the year last year. (might be exaggerating a bit, but I'm sure I have seen some).

I do know that there was Google Image Search then and these answers mostly all used Google Image Search too.

Generally I thought Stackexchange encouraged more questions. I have to say that being more stricter on identification requests is a bit silly. It sounds like you want to force and strain visitors/question askers into writing 60 paragraphs of description. Sometimes even 3-4 lines is enough for some person who knows it to answer it if you include the Genre, a specific scene and some other details and it kinda reduces people from just looking away to the next question and losing interest due to how long it is.

Finally the last thing I would say is that if we want more answers to the unanswered id requests then we need a wider and bigger Anime & Manga community with people who watch and read different types rather than Naruto and other animes/mangas that fall under the category Shounen. That way, if someone asks a id request for a yaoi manga for example, we have some other users who can answer them on the site and if we have more people, with a variety who watch different things then there is more of a chance of these getting answers and possibly good ones too. To be honest, I didn't really notice this. To me it doesn't seem to be spoiling anything, its just that there aren't any answers to them....yet....otherwise I think I might just stay undecided for now.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The reason for "strict rules" is first and foremost to prevent too short questions with almost no description, and then to remind the OP of some characteristics of the show/characters which he might forget to mention, but which are actually very helpful in identifying it. But this "rule" is more of a guideline, and the asker doesn't have to fill out every possible text field, so I think it's rather useful and not too straining on the askers.


















Since January 16, 2013 the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-specialpokemon-special tag was used only twice and both times the question was also tagged with the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemonpokemon tag. So it made me wonder what the point was of keeping this tag around. Especially since the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemonpokemon tag includes mangas based on the game, which pokemon adventures comes closest too iirc.

I removed the tags from the two only posts that were using them, in order for the tag to be removed. If I was wrong in doing so, these were the two posts tagged accordingly.

Questions like "What is this anime song?" or "What manga is this character from?" are vague by their title. Unless one takes a look inside, one cannot be helped by the solutions to these answers.

That makes this website function unlike other Stack Exchange communities. To quote it, Stack Exchange believes in questions that present, well, the question. It is their motto to not be a discussion portal or a forum.

However, these questions do classify as questions and are appropriate at this website. Someone might really want to know who a specific character is.

All the questions tied by the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag should therefore be a different genre of questions, or pseudo-questions, which do not conform totally by the Stack Exchange guidelines.

I can think of only three solutions (these are personal opinions only and can be revised or abandoned):


Visual differentiation: We might differentiate such questions visually, so that they seem outer questions. A color change might do.
Encouraging and teaching users about the rightful usage and crafting descriptive questions.
Lengthening descriptions of those questions, or of all questions, can be beneficial.


Anime and Manga Stack Exchange is a special Stack Exchange website, and therefore needs special rules, probably.

But Why Should We Do It?


It's hard to skip the common sense that goes against such questions.
It's like not going by the ideals of Stack Exchange. For example, on Ask Ubuntu, I cannot ask questions like "What text editor is this?" and then slam all the description in the body. I will get downvoted a lot. (However, Ask Ubuntu doesn't even support identification-type questions, so maybe this point is useless.)


It also has bad implications: My question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13253/what-is-that-twiggy-strand-in-hair-of-some-anime-characters-calledWhat is that twiggy strand in hair of some anime characters called? is marked as a duplicate (and rightfully so) for this question: "What is this hairstyle called?" (which is now changed to "Name of hair style with one strand sticking upwards" (which is apparently a non-standard, discussion-evoking question, but already has answers, so skips this issue)).

Now, if the other question had a descriptive name like mine, I would've found it in the search. But with such a non-descriptive name, even if I see the title, I won't bother to go inside it. Common sense. I would think that there can be a lot of hair styles - and would be tempted to write my own question (which I did).

Just edit the title so that it asks a real question or makes it clear what it's about.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm. You solved the problem a bit too quickly that I can't think how can that entirely uproot the problem. I think you're not looking at the big picture here, the concept.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Question titles aren't really that big a deal. It's the content that's important. Check out hundreds of questions with purposely ambiguous titles in the Hot Network Questions list. Nobody is editing them because nobody has a real problem with them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But new visitors, which Stack Exchange gives utmost priority, are not helped by the titles, even if their query matches that of the description to that question. Neither will his or her query appear on Google searches, in-site searchers, or anywhere else because the user wants to know the name for dupe and the questions (that have his or her answer) go like: name of this hairstyle. I really don't think those questions are useful at all for most people.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want a site with identification-type questions, you might check for scifi / movies .seb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Title does not have to explain what the question is about with absolute precision. The body of the question serves that purpose. Title only has to be clear enough to make difference between questions with similar titles. But there are some types of questions that make it almost impossible to do (music identification requests). New users who don't know this should familiarize with how StackExchange works before saying it works "wrong".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5related: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/889/should-there-be-a-guide-line-for-naming-identification-requests and http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/977/id-requests-and-their-generic-titles


















This will be the "quick answer".

If you see such a title there's roughly 2 possibilites. 


The question is formulated badly.
The question is formulated nicely.


Assuming we are only in the area of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions (even for almost all other questions) then the path for such questions is simple.

If the question is formulated badly, you should close it (or in your case flag for closing), because it either does not fulfil the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892criteria imposed on identification requests, or is unclear.

If the question is formulated nicely, then just the title needs a change. The best thing about StackExchange is: You can make it better. Suggest an edit to the question. You don't need any rep for that, and if it gets approved, you get +2. --> Everybody wins.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're not getting the point of this question. Of course you can edit all questions that might have vague titles, but that doesn't solve the problem, does it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abhimanyu why does it not solve the problem??b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is that vague titled questions can make SE a forum and do not specify the title. IDK about you, but I know that most SE sites seem to be wanting askers to put special emphasis on the title, even more than the body. For example, it's said that you should write your question first and then think the title. The title is the thing, and that's what's exactly spammed here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abhimanyu I fail to see the point you're making. It's OP's choice to make a title. If he sucks at it, well so be it. If you don't like the title, change it. If OP doesn't listen to advice... well he will get what he deserves. I fail to see the problem you have with that. Feel free to ping me in [chat] though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know much about the chat ;__; Anyway. Well, you're wrong. If identification-requests are left to be like how they are currently, it's bad for SE businessb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abhimanyu sorry to tell you, but you can't just tell me I am wrong, and expect me to accept that. Also **why should it be bad for SE business?** You fail to make your point clear and present biased opinions of your own as absolute truth. What are you trying to accomplish? From what I see, it's definitely not a discussion but a one-sided half-rant with a big "Please confirm my opinions"-banner on it. And that's definitely not the purpose of meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Abhimanyu please provide authorative references confirming that SE is indeed interested in question titles more than the question contents, and how exactly bad titles harm the business of SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51. In a new question, it says "What's your anime or manga question? Be specific" in the title box of the question. "What is this character" is, well, not specific.
2. In my discussions on Ubuntu and Philosophy SE, it's stressed that those questions shall be avoided whose titles can mislead new visitors, as SE treats new visitors before existing members. (I couldn't find it states anywhere, but it does, and rightfully so)
3. I'm just saying that identification questions do not help new visitors. That's all. What's so big deal? It's common sense...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Precisely so. It's not a big deal, like you said. Identification questions are most helpful to the askers of these questions. Anime&Manga allows these questions because it's not a big deal to answer them for us. And there is always a chance, that these questions may help other users that search for similar descriptions. And the better the guidelines for descriptions, the higher the chance. But there is a limit to how good any given asker can conform to these guidelines exactly because they don't remember something. And there is nothing we can do except guide them and ask additional questions.


















I just asked a question about The Gentlemen's Alliance Cross, which I tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gentlemens-alliance-crossgentlemens-alliance-cross. It could also be tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-gentlemens-alliance-crossthe-gentlemens-alliance-cross which is technically the English name, though that seemed a bit long. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shinshi-doumei-crossshinshi-doumei-cross is the Japanese name, but I don't know if that's the name that people would know it by, so that would probably work better as a synonym if anything.

Pretty much like the title says, should questions about Tokusatsu series (Kamen Rider, Ultraman, Sentai series, etc) be included/can be asked in or should it have its own subdomain such as tokusatsu.stackexchange.com?

We are also not apart of Stack Overflow. Any relation is merely a coincidence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, edited it. Thanks for mentioning it. My mistake.


















So, this question about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13256/characteristics-%E2%88%92-manga-attributesCharacteristics − Manga attributes is currently on-hold and I also give a vote close to this question, but when I think again, is this question really too broad?

I'll give you some points here:


OP only ask for the differences on characteristics between a comic and a manga. In my understanding (I might be wrong), he asks about what are the differences between how the characters are drawn in a comic and manga. Not the difference between comics and a manga as a whole media.
This question got a link to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/69/what-differentiates-anime-from-regular-cartoonsa question about What differentiates anime from regular cartoons? Compared with this, that question is way broader. And it's not a dupe, because while the question is related to each other, this question only asks about differences between how the characters are drawn (first point).
Comics really varies around the world. This is basically everywhere except Japan. So it might be still too broad. So instead of asking a question about comics as general, this question might can be reworded with Western/American Comics compared with Japanese manga. But even with this, I still don't know how varies western comics are. I only know a few comics like Marvel, DC Comics and Disney. So, this might be a reason not to reopen this question.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the question about Characteristics − Manga attributes really too broad?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do find the difference in treatment of this question and the previous one to be somewhat unusual. See [this meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/153/is-what-differentiates-anime-from-regular-cartoons-off-topic) for the reasoning behind keeping that one open. We've debated it several times since then, to little avail and with no consensus. I don't really care about either question individually, but I would prefer if we were consistent on how we dealt with these two.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you that my question wasn't clear enough. I can edit and specify it. I also didn't found the other question who was quite similar to mine, but when is look at this other question, i think she is at least as broad as mine...
but if id would help i also can delete my question, it's not that big deal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BBallBoy you don't have to delete your question, but you can edit it. It's not a bad question in my opinion. You might consider Toshinou's answer if you want to edit it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5thx reopen it :)


















While writing my question on Good Luck Girl!, I noticed that the tag is currently set to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/binbou-gami-gabinbou-gami-ga, and doesn't appear to have any synonyms. However, http://www.funimation.com/shows/good-luck-girl/homeat least on Funimation, the anime title is given as Good Luck Girl!, so I'm inclined to suggest that good-luck-girl be added as a synonym. (It's worth noting that on http://www.hulu.com/binbogami-gaHulu, the name "Binbougami ga" is kept. The first usage is also seen on Funimation clips on YouTube, such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPtKMbtHbtcthis one.)

However, since I have written exactly zero answers for that tag, I can't suggest tag synonyms on the tag page (and so am mentioning this here). (Also feel free to retag this question if I've tagged it improperly).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Add "Good Luck Girl" as a tag synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you add links to sources in your post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha: added some links to Funimation and info about the usage on Hulub2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Madman (AU) seems to be using [Good Luck Girl!](http://www.madman.com.au/news/karneval-and-good-luck-girl/) as well with a subtitle "Binbogami ga!". I can't say I've ever heard "Good Luck Girl" before now, but if that's what it's licensed as in most places, we should probably use it for the main tag name.


















I was wondering but is the site batoto a legal manga reading site or not? I noticed on an answer on this question: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5197/how-did-the-female-titan-cut-erens-titan-form?answertab=active#tab-topHow did the Female Titan cut Eren's titan form? has a link, linking to Batoto.

Batoto sounds legal when I was Google Searching it. I have used this site before and enjoy high quality manga and minimal ad's etc however I am probably guessing just like all other manga reading sites on the internet, this ones probably illegal too.

So is Batoto legal?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is batoto a legal site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Highly doubt it. Again, I don't know why we care about linking to sites that do host scanlations. We've been [told directly by Anna Lear to not care](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/8140216#8140216) and our official policy is just [don't ask for, or advertise, links to stuff that is obviously illegal](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/406/274).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア Thanks for the links and thanks for your opinion on the matter. (y) - edit the links out (?).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMO, yes, leave the link. It provides context to the answer and does not harm it in any way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア Just wanted to say I wasn't trying to be a lawyer :P - Thanks.


















Batoto distributes unlicensed manga for free, so it's pretty safe to say that it's illegal. They do remove manga once they're officially licensed overseas, which I guess is better than some other sites, but it's still not a licensed provider of any manga I know of. 

Moreover, Batoto is one of the many targets of the http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/30/national/japan-begins-anti-piracy-campaign-300-internet-sites/recent crackdown by the Japanese government on piracy sites:


 Thanks to Krazer for the image.

Based on that, it seems pretty clear that for our purposes, this isn't the kind of site we want to be advertising or asking about.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMO it's still not something we need to worry about. If we get a DMCA and SE Legal doesn't care to argue fair use (for educational purpose), SE will delete the link and related images.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア As I've said before, I don't think this is a matter of copyright at all. SE handles copyright procedures, but we have our own image to worry about as well. Not linking to illegal sources in questions or answers is for our own image as a serious anime/manga site; doing anything else would be disrespectful to the creators and the source material.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mmmm.... Why should we users enforce Copyright in our sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Braiam: Have you read the comment before yours? It is just for the image of the site, and if this site is littered with links to illegal manga reading sites, the site may be considered as promoting illegal channel to copyrighted content. Anyway, there is no need of any links to such sites. People can use google to reach them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There isn't an official policy we should take. However, if you feel that a link to Botato or whatever site is wrong, feel free to change it to a better link (i.e. Imgur?) which doesn't lead the reader to a site with questionable legality.


















Over at http://anime.stackexchange.comAnime & Manga, a lot of users come with images of anime fan art, cosplays, gifs, etc and ask who the character is, or which show they are from.

The only problem with these questions is that we get a lot of badly researched questions. Specifically, users could put their images into http://www.google.ie/imghpGoogle Image Search or similar reverse image search engines and get their answer quickly.

For example, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13396/help-me-find-this-anime-with-a-red-haired-character-who-has-a-tattoo-on-their-fothis id request can be easily discovered with a quick search

What I propose is that when a low-rep user is writing one of these questions (tagged "identification-request" & containing an image), a message advising users of these identification methods could be shown.



We have a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/793/how-can-i-identify-an-anime-using-reverse-image-searchmeta question on our site about how users can go about finding image sources themselves.

I believe this measure could help question quality significantly.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Improve question quality by informing users of reverse image search sitesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This would also be useful on TV&Movies and Sci-Fi sites, because they also have identification questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Arqade could benefit from it too - game identification is off-topic without an audiovisual artifact, but often those questions boil down to a google reverse image search of that same artifact.


















We could add this to the sidebar help on /questions/ask, but first let's try something a bit more direct:



This will appear any time someone uses the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag. It won't stop them from posting the question, but it should catch their attention - and it provides a direct link to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618the relevant post.

Are we doing this by upvotes vs downvotes... or total upvotes vs your suggested 'quality' of the answer? So much confusion... honestly it only makes sense to downvote (but I haven't). Please clarify :) In retrospect, I see you've accepted your own answer. Not that it matters, but... really? Community man, that's your username! While I would say that maybe *too many* questions on this SE site (and others) are subject to "what is this thing that I'm thinking of?" I think there needs to be a more critical evaluation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisCirefice The user 'Community' is a bot/robot. It isn't actually a real person in retrospect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was being sarcastic. Well, trying to be. I know that community is a bot - I was hoping that since nobody provided any actual feedback, that somebody would based on my comment. +9 vote on the question and -2 on the only answer demonstrates that more discussion needs to be done concerning this question/answer.


















Usually a question is voted according to it's content. A well posed or interesting question will receive lots of up-votes to give it some spotlight for possible interested readers to read. Now how should identification requests be voted? I usually upvote the answerer, as id-request usually take some effort to find, but what makes a certain id-request question more valuable then another?

For example if we would look at the top four most voted id-requests the question basically contains nothing more than a picture. Does that mean those are good asked questions? We know they aren't, but they come out on top and set an example of what id-requests should look like. One could argue that picture based questions are valuable as they usually come from a forum and if another person would google that picture they'd come out on our website. But wouldn't we want questions like the fifth top question to come out on top? Questions with a lot of information to go on. Well structured, with some effort put into?

Anyway tl;dr, are there any regulations or guidelines towards voting identification requests or should I just continue to vote based on the feeling I have when reading the question?

Prompted by TONS of questions (just browse the site, won't even link examples here) about where to find SUB or DUB of your favorite anime, where the OP does not care about HOW he will access his media, but adds the sacred "how can I legally" to the question and suddenly everything is OK.

A lot of posts have been made about how to deal with illegal material, but what about legal material?

The question about https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/6703/6166the person asking for Spanish subbed Dragonball Z episodes, made me wonder what kind of answers would be appropriate if such question would be allowed here.

What sites would be considered okay? Amazon? Ebay? Or maybe even a local Spanish website? What would be appropriate conduct be in such a case?

Posting a link like http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0014567WKthis just doesn't feel right at SE tbh.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we deal with users posting links to legal material?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Posting links to legitimate vendors for legitimate products is perfectly fine. SE [converts](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26964/auto-inserting-stack-overflow-affiliate-into-all-amazon-book-links) all Amazon links to use their affiliate link, so it's perfectly fine do do so. For obviously illegal sources or even questionable one, flag them for a moderator to review.


















I noticed that the template for replying to id-requests has become something like


Name of the manga/anime
Picture with evidence
Synopsis
Link(s) to sources


Coincidently I came across some old one-liner answers from 2013. There will probably be more of those around.


https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/2606/6166https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/2606/6166  
https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/6231/6166https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/6231/6166


At that time it was apparently accepted to give one-liner answers, while now they would be voted down or suggested to edit with more evidence. If such answers are encountered much after date, should they be flagged according to the current standard that is set out? Or should they be left alone as it might become a tedious job cleaning them all up and not really worth it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should old answers be cleaned up according to the new standard?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Id-requests (answer and question) aren't very searchable as they stand, but you can flag those question for a moderator to review. I personally don't like them and will at least add a post notice to them if they are not accepted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not a huge fan of this template to be honest. It's okay for some answers, but often times there's other information which is more important that doesn't get added when you follow this, e.g. what episode an image is from, who the characters are, what the context of the image is, etc. In many cases the synopses given are just copied from wikipedia or somewhere else and slightly modified, which is not terribly helpful if they aren't tailored to the actual question. Still better than one-liners, but I don't think this should be the "new standard" or anything like that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I guess the *template* would be for picture based one-liner *what anime is this* requests. I usually only answer those as I have trouble finding the text based ones. We should make a community program that crawls the internet for those damn requests or something lol. And for those requests I do indeed add episode number and time frame and i'll add character name too, but unless more is asked thats it.


















I have no idea whether this is recent or old but why has this question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4696/what-databases-and-listing-sites-exist-for-anime-manga-etc?answertab=active#tab-topWhat databases and listing sites exist for anime, manga, etc? got the following


  We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed.


Could someone explain why? Is the answer not good enough? If not what are some reasons that could be pointed out to improve it?

I couldn't think of any and the answer seems very well researched and written. Might need a few tweaks e.g. such as adding new sites if anyone knows any but other than that I do not believe this notice is necessary.

Also what would be the point in adding another answer? Can we remove the notice/caption for this question.

We can always protect it but there seems to be no point really. Also there would be no point since if you wanted to add a link, you should really just edit it into the current answer.


















Recently some user(s) posted a lot of questions about Death Note rules interaction. To me it is like some puzzling game with the rules of the DN.

Would a tag for these questions be useful?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would a "death-note-rule-puzzle" tag be useful for the site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm absolutely against those because they are borderline off-topic, and are almost never 100% answerable with in-universe knowledge. Answers would be opinion-based and this isn't how SE works.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While we do seem to get a good couple of these, I don't see why the normal death-note tag isn't sufficientb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[tag:death-note-rules] *might* be okay, though I'm not convinced [tag:death-note] alone is insufficient. I don't think it's a good idea to add "puzzle" though.


















These "What would happen if" questions are no different from "What would happen if Goku fights Madara?". Almost always unanswerable and off-topic.

So no, I am against such a tag.

I've been watching a lot of older anime shows lately (like, pre-1950), and there are a few I would like to be able to source.

A good few of these are so old that their copyright has run out and they are in the public domain.

Would it be okay to ask for download links (or similar) to these shows even if they go to a supposedly 'illegal' site? [Provided it is certain that they are public domain]

(by 'illegal' I mean ones that we would usually consider illegal for copyrighted works such as the pirate bay or many 'free' streaming anime sites)

I just thought I'd ask before putting up some questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it okay to allow 'illegal' sites if the anime/manga is in the public domain?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While this doesn't answer the question, if the work is really public domain, there shouldn't be any problems uploading it yourself to YouTube or some other reputable general-purpose streaming site. I'd think that, when possible, that's a better approach than linking to somewhere questionable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That seems better alright :)

I flagged two comments as obsolete yesterday because they referred to older versions of the post, and because the issues that had been pointed out were already fixed:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/475/2604This, where someone asks for a source which was later added, although looking back on it, I imagine that the comment might still be useful for some people who might not have seen the edit yet.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/3787/2604This, where someone asks for edits for grammar/readability that were later made.


I later noticed today that both of my flags were declined. Why was this the case? I noticed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/772/2604this question on Meta, but I don't think it necessarily addresses my confusion, and while https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1007/2604this question also seems useful, I have no idea if the circumstances were similar to mine.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why were my comment flags declined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, these comments should be removed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it possible these were declined automatically because of some time limit? I don't remember whether comment flags have time limits, but I do know that all three of the mods were absent from this site for at least a few days in the past week, so flags could have potentially fallen through the cracks if they were time-limited.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IIRC, comments about editorial issues should be removed once the problem has been resolved, and flagging is a valid channel. At least since last year, there has been some discussion on Meta.SO (now Meta.SE) about encouraging people to flag comment for deletion if the issue in the comment has been resolved (under "obsolete" reason).


















I feel that it can is sometimes too easy to misjudge the relevance of a comment thread, even if the issue at hand was resolved. Often times to understand a question or answer's edit history, you need to see the comments as well. A comment can express a common misconception that then gets cleared up by the OP, but should be left as a note for future subsequent generations so they don't make the same mistake.

I feel that the way the current method of comment deletion might not be not very transparent, as I believe there isn't a way to keep track of deleted comments (for regular, non-high users), or protest their deletion. 

In short, I don't think there should be a culture of deleting comments among mods, except for the generally accepted exceptions where it takes place already: When comments are rude, or a conversation gets completely derailed and off-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think there's a good point here, but only for _in-depth edit histories_. If someone asks for a source and the person adds it, I don't see that as necessary to justify the addition of a source in edit history. If, on the other hand, a provided source is deemed invalid for a specific reason, I think it makes sense to keep the comments.


















If a persons likes to know the release dates of a particular anime or manga episode, or like if someone is asking when is the new season of a particular anime releasing.

Linking to external sites subjects to link rot.

Is it a good idea to host all such images on imgur and add a footnote citing the source of the image?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we convert all links to images to imgur and add a footnote pointing to the source?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Convenient query for doing so: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/180619/cleanup-find-images-not-hosted-on-imgur. The number of images needing this isn't too large; I'd do it myself if I had the time right now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM - Just for everyone else's convenience I have done some of them already. :) (also that's a pretty handy link too).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Keep in mind we should not be converting all NSFW links. Spoiler tags might be okay here, but *hyperlinking* to imgur is good too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There were about 100-200(?) images that needed to be rehosted back in April when I made the query that Logan linked to in the above comment. The reason there are no more images from before April 2014 (besides the Death Note one that is too large to host on imgur) is that I edited all those posts and rehosted the images to imgur. I encourage other people to also do this.


















When a flag of mine gets rejected, it's usually a 'low quality' flag.

Can I get some clarification about how they work?


  


I flagged an answer here, which was rejected - but then the answer was deleted by mods - presumably because it was low quality.

Below is a current answer which is live, which I feel is similar.

I think it's unarguably a bad answer. But I'm unsure, because it could be salvaged by editing, to be slightly better, but still bad.


  


Personally, I think the low quality flag is being seen as a formatting flag - which taken to reporting-level is basically the same as a spam post, just not advertising.

What should I do in cases like this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When do i flag low-quality?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the problem was maybe you should have used the 'other' option so you could type in and explain why you were flagging the question/answer rather than using the default option reserved for completely unsalvagable questions/answers.


















Very low quality flags are reserved for post which cannot be salvaged.

The flag says:


  This question has severe formatting or content problems. This question is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed.


Most (and by most I mean, 80%+) of the VLC flags I see can be salvaged by editing from the OP's (or even another community member's!) side. 

Also, on the majority of said flags, a simple vote down is sufficient, if you feel fancy, leave a comment to OP and explain what's wrong and what he should add in an edit.

Examples:


  [in response to an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request...] The anime is Death Note


Downvote and comment "Please edit this question to include some more details, why do you think that this is Death Note? How does Death Note match OP's description?" etc.


  I like potatos


Doesn't relate to anything and should be removed. VLC applies nicely.


  I'm not sure, but your answer can be found on this awesome site that also sells potatoes!

I'm here to gauge interest in doing an Anime and Manga Stack Exchange gift exchange for the month of December. The specifics are still in the air but your question, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The idea is as follows:


You are pseudo-randomly given a number and matched up with another person, who will send you a present. You will only send that address to that one person and no one else. I'll try to pair people close to one another, if possible. However it is likely that most people will be shipping internationally.
The gift can be physical or digital. The suggested value of the gift should be ~$20 USD or equivalent (once you factor in the cost of living in your area; TODO: Find some sort of stable product to use for value reference). You may exceed the recommend amount, but know that your gesture might or might not be reciprocated. You can avoid hassles and high cost/hassle of shipping by sending your gift digitally.
The gift should be anime or manga related, but this is more of a soft requirement.
Gifts should arrive by the beginning of January at the latest, but ideally before Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa/etc holiday. International post will be given more leeway.
Eligibility will probably be given to users who have been here for at least 1 month (by December) and have at least 50 rep OR have accumulated at least 200 rep. Whichever criteria is fulfilled first.
Giftees may post or send their preference in terms of gifts to the Gifter, but it is up to the Gifter to decide what to send.
Gifters do not need to disclose what they are sending the giftee, unless their country's customs enforcement requires them to. Marking your gifts as "gifts" may help you or your giftee avoid certain taxes.
Please don't send any inappropriate or slanderous items that the giftee might not enjoy.
Participation is on an opt-in basis (probably via Google Forms). This is purely a community event and is by no way associated or endorsed by the site, Stack Exchange, or it's operators. We can't be responsible for damaged, lost packages, etc. But if you never got you package by a certain date, we can at least try to match you up with someone who's willing to re-gift.


If this is popular enough, we might continue this in the future and possibly make a web app to handle matching.

Please leave your questions, comments, and/or suggestions in this thread. They are always welcomed.

One worry I'd have is that I feel 200 rep is too low a barrier to entry. By all means I want more participants - but I also want to have my gift reciprocated, and it might just me being sceptical but I feel newer users would be less likely to do so

Maybe you could have two tiers 800+ & 200+, or something.

Or if I'm the only one who feels like this, you could just change mine if I'm matched with someone very new. Or maybe people could pick who to gift?

Another question I have is:  Will giftees know who their gifters are before receiving their present? You mentioned sending preferences to gifters so this is what brought this question up in my mind. Maybe it could be mentioned by participants with their entry post (if done on meta)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd rather only the gifter know the giftee's addresses (provided by the giftee). So for simplicity/security purposes it will not be a "secret Santa" type of event (if it's well received, it can be in the future).

From watching just the first movie, I would say no.

But the stories are too different, and they go such separate ways that, at the end of the third movie, I am watching something completely inedit.

Having only one tag would help group all Evangelion questions into one feed, but also would be useless to identify what continuity the OP is speaking of.

For example, if one were to ask: "Did Kaworu and Shinji ever kissed?", someone would have to ask in comments "NGE or Rebuild?"

So, three choices:


Do not make another tag. Leave the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion tag only.  
Create two tags. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rebuild-of-evangelionrebuild-of-evangelion. Let people interested in Evangelion follow both or only one if they want.
Change the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion into just https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evangelionevangelion, and make it apply to both. Maybe do tag synonims.


My personal opinion is #2 or #3. Rebuild's movie 4.44 is due next year, and there will be a renewed interest in discussing the movie storyline, comparing both, etc.
Leaving rebuild questions tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/neon-genesis-evangelionneon-genesis-evangelion can be confusing to some users.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have separate tags for "Neon Genesis Evangelion" and "Rebuild of Evangelion"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd go for either 1 or 3, but I have only watched the original series. In either case, the OP could always specify which continuity she's referring to.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Either 2 or 3 IMO. I will detail more in an answer later, but I think there is a large distinction.

you should separate them, reason is because separate questions are better for sites like google to keep track of.

We've recently had a slight drop in traffic, and while that in and of itself isn't too worrying for a number of reasons, it does indicate that we should probably at least look at whether there's anything we're not doing right. 

If we want to get traffic, the most obvious series to target are those that are currently airing. But at the moment, we don't even have tags for a very large number of currently airing series. Not having a tag means that new users aren't likely to bring their questions to us, unless they happen to be aware of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag or use something else that doesn't quite fit. So it makes sense to prioritize creating tags for these series.

Of course, the way tags are created on Stack Exchange sites is by users asking questions. We can't create tags if no one is asking a question, and even if we did the tags would be removed if they weren't being used on any questions. So what this really means is that we need people to volunteer to ask a question about these series to get the tags into the system.

Given that Fall 2014 season is just beginning, now seems like a good time to do this. The purpose of this post is to keep track of what series are airing this season, what tags already exist, and which series still need tags, and to coordinate efforts to create these.

If you're willing to contribute by asking a (good) question about one of these series, feel free to leave a comment under the answer. Once you do (preferably as soon as possible), edit the relevant line on the answer to point to the tag page. The hope is that by doing this, we can get to something like 50% coverage of all airing anime, which would mean most popular things are covered. 

Of course, this is completely optional, but if you do notice a series that you're watching is listed as no tag, at least consider whether you can come up with a good question about it.

And then you don't need the prompt questions anymoreb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko While that precludes some types of story questions, there are other questions you can ask which are not directly about the story and not likely to be answered in the show itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we know if passing visitors actually become less likely to ask something if they don't find an existing tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1306322 It would be very hard for us to get statistics on this, but it seems inevitable since the system offers literally no helpful guidance in this case. I do know that during one of the podcasts, someone from Stack Exchange mentioned that they tracked traffic on a similar site (probably Arqade) and noticed that it was quite common common for users to try to ask a question, but leave after realizing the tag didn't exist, and that this seemed to adversely affect most of the sites which weren't focused on technology or science. It's hard to see how the story would be different here.


















Here's a list of all TV anime (ignoring shorts) airing in Fall 2014 as per http://anichart.net/fallAnichart. Each one is listed together with any relevant tags. They're sorted by start date. Shows from last season are included, but long-running shows (among which we have fairly good coverage) are not.

Manga, LNs, etc are more varied in terms of scheduling and typically maintain fanbases for longer, but for anime we really only have a 3-month window where interest is peaked for the average show, so it's important to get them tagged during that period whenever possible.


















When asking for information about an event in a particular series,  how should we behave? Both when asking and when answering a question. 

Questions like 
 - why did X kill Y? 
 - why did X do XYZ? 
And all the possible variations,  should they be marked in some way when asking?  Maybe by placing a spoiler warning at the beginning of the question or by using a particular tag? 

When we answer,  should we take measures against spoiling the plot? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we treat spoilers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Generally, for answers, you should answer the question to the best of your ability, whether or not it constitutes a spoiler. You can use the spoiler markup `>! spoilers here` in posts to hide spoilers if you have to reference something later in the series after what the OP has referenced. For questions, you don't really need to do anything.


















An example would be this question:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14347/what-are-the-original-memes-mentioned-in-steinsgateWhat are the original memes mentioned in Steins;Gate?

I think it would be nice to have a collaborative effort to answer such a question. The scope is 24 episodes, plus an OVA, plus a movies. As long as the series is reasonably sized, it can possibly be answer through collaborative effort.

Possible problem would be low quality answers/partial answers. While it can be solved by adding a single answer and close the question, getting people to edit the answer is hard.

Even with those downsides, I think having such question would increase the value of our site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow a question that asks for list of references throughout a series?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This discussion is more of allowing a question that can be considered to be broad to be answered via collaborative effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It has a defined answer and it is reasonably scoped, I think. We did decide to allow in-universe list questions, and IIRC this falls under that blanket.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア: I ask this, since the question in question (pun intended) has accumulated 3 close votes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I agree with asking. I voted to leave open; it would be nice if those voters would give their opinions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the question is about a single series, to the best of my knowledge it's still covered by http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it's reasonably scoped. There is no way to tell that a list of this sort is complete as a show could reference just about anything, just as http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4129/what-are-all-the-cross-references-in-binbo-gami-ga was closedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't think there were that many memes in Steins;Gate. Not as much cultural references as Binbougami Ga.  I probably should have clarified that I wanted to know if there's any corresponding Japanese memes to the English translated memes and only the ones that are English translated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko I fully disagree. Not only do I think the question you linked is a bad example, given your answer, but the meme base in *Steins;Gate* is reasonably small.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question was closed just after I answered it, you can see how many series there were in my answer so it was rightly closed - I cannot be sure I have all the references correct.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My issue is really with the vaguity of 'meme', although you say the list is a small enoughb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that the linked question qualifies under the previously-agreed-upon rules for lists that Logan M linked to above (it is specific, objective, reasonably scoped at 24 episodes/OAV/movie/ONA w/o a ton of memes included, and not prone to change), so I voted to re-open the question.


















With the holidays coming up, tis the season to be jolly. Regardless of your race, religion , creed, or otaku power level, we're all gathered here by our interest in anime and/or manga! Why not celebrate this time with a gift exchange among community fellow members (mods included!)? 

To participate, you will need a minimum of 200 reputation excluding the association bonus (at least 300 with the association bonus) and have an account age of at least 1 month by Wednesday, November 5th. The elevated barrier of entry is there to ensure that those participating has what it takes to follow through with their commitment to the event. 

Here's how the event will go down: 


First you sign up by submit some basic information through http://goo.gl/forms/dz9QoGdpXZthis form. You'll be asked for the following: 


Your Anime.SE username 
You email where you wish to be contacted 
The city/country/providence you are located in 
If you are willing ship your gift far away? (If not we'll try to match you with someone close by)
Acknowledge the http://anime-se.github.io/gift-exchange-tou/Terms of Use (read: keiyaku) 
And a few other things...


The deadline to sign up is Wednesday, November 5th. You will be assigned a number, and on Monday, November 10th you will be paired up with another fellow user and given their username and contact (only the number will be posted here). It's up to you, as the Gifter, to contact them, the Giftee, to get their contact and shipping info (some parcel services require you to include an phone number). PLEASE DO NOT USE P.O. BOXES. Try to format you contact as so (include the Anime.SE username as a c/o so the Giftee knows that the parcel is related to the exchange): 



  Asami Sanada 
  411 Gamers Rd 
  Apt. 723, c/o Dejiko 
  Winter Garden, DG 
  Broccoli Country 



The Gifter does not have to reveal themselves to the Giftee, nor do they have to pick anything listed on the Giftee's wishlist. The soft requirement for the gift is for it to be somewhat anime and manga related (handmade goods are always welcomed!). The suggested value of you present should be around $20 USD or the economic equivalent (certain countries may have a higher or lower cost of living compare to others.) Contact a moderator is you are unsure about any aspect (including economic conversion). Gifts can be digital if you do not have the means of sending a physical parcel at a reasonable rate, but try to do your research to ensure that the Giftee won't have trouble getting access to it in their respective country. 
You Gifter won't be your Giftee, and viceversa. The pairings will happen something like this, assuming there are 5 people participating: 



  #1 --gifts--> #2 --gifts--> #3 --gifts--> #4 --gifts--> #5  --gifts--> #1 



The deadline to ship your gift is by December 10th. If for some reason you cannot make the deadline, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR GIFTEE to let them know. Be sure to send an email informing your Giftee that their gift has been sent, if possible, include a tracking number or a teaser image of what to expect. 
When you get your gift, be sure let your Gifter know you have. Afterwards, post it for other people to see (so they can be jolly) on this meta (A separate meta question will be posted). You may use an Imgur album if you so choose. Be sure to post your reactions as well. Feels free to post links to it in your preferred social network(s). 
If you haven't had any contact from your Gifter by the shipping deadline, please email a moderator and we'll work on getting you rematched ASAP. 
The most voted gift may receive a hidden bonus?! (Stay tuned for more info)
Contact a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsmoderator via chat or by email at anime.mods@madara.ninja if you have any issues, questions, or need help on anything related to this event. 
Let's all have fun and play together! 


To start, opt-in: http://goo.gl/forms/dz9QoGdpXZ>> HERE << OPT-INS ARE CLOSED!!


Sign up ends: Wednesday, Nov. 5
Matching happens on: Monday, Nov. 10th You should have been matched! Contact a moderator, if you haven't!
You should ship by: Sunday, Dec. 7
If you don't get a response of any sort about your present being shipped by Friday, Dec. 12, notify a moderator and we'll get you rematched.

We currently have three off-topic reasons:


Requests for illegal materials
Reading recommendations
Unannounced future events


I feel that all three are reasonably used today, and I've noticed another trend which isn't completely new, but I start noticing it more and more.

I propose a fourth off-topic close reason, 


This identification request contains too little detail to be answered. Please refer to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892these guidelines and add more details to your question.


I know this falls under the subset of "Unclear", but I think a close reason specifically for that, with the appropriate links and explanations is a good idea. It's not always clear to users what we expect of them in these types of questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we need a fourth off-topic reason for identification requests that contain too little detail?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most definitely!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I think 'unclear' is very misleading to the user, as an under-detailed question can still be well writtenb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/242247/are-there-close-reasons-that-appear-only-for-questions-with-specific-tags


















I was gonna create this post only for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, but then noticed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/735/49this other post that asks for the same for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag. As such, I'll make this about both (also because the other post is almost a year old, and got very little attention).

We have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag so that users with low rep that want to ask a question about a series which has no tag yet can use it, and wait for somebody with enough rep to create it for them.
And we have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request for when users want to have a series or image identified.

However, many new users seem to either use completely random tags for either of the above, or to recur to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production many times.  



I propose that these two tags be suggested by default here

in order to have something more like what happens in meta

where the tags suggested are fixed (I think the ones suggested on the main site are random, but if not, at least these two tags should be there by default).  



Or maybe have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1084/49some warning, like the one that shows up if you use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request:

That could read something like "Can't find the tag you're looking for? Try 'retag' for a new series or 'identification-request' if you want help identifying a series".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Having "identification-request" and "retag" show up as tag suggestions by defaultb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good idea, I've retagged several id requests that used bizarre tags like [tag:japanese-language] or the tag of some series that was similar to the series the OP was looking for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think a lot of users use anime-production because it is the first thing they see when they type anime


















I don't think it a good idea to encourage the use of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request.

To tackle retagging first: it's not unusual for authors to miss-tag their questions. There's not a site on the network that doesn't have tags that are misused frequently. We have https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/242661/1438an escalation process to remove bad tags and we make it as easy as possible for https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-toolshigh-reputation users to edit question tags. So the usual path is for authors to do their best to tag correctly and editors to fix their mistakes.  I consider https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag to be a http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/harmful meta tag.

While I think identification questions are less than ideal, I do think https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1085/5367they have a place on many sites. But I don't think encouraging such questions is a great idea. People already jump to those sorts of questions on many sites and prompting more hurts the overall usefulness of this site.



I completely missed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1083/improve-question-quality-by-informing-users-of-reverse-image-search-sites/1084#1084Shog's meta post so I'm taking back my snap advice for the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request wiki.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The idea behind the creation and usage of [tag:retag] is explained [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/399/49). Of course, it can be revised, but at the time it seemed that the general consensus was that it could be a useful tag (I think a lot of the debate about this was also held in chat, 'cause I can't seem to find anything else on it here, but remember it being talked over).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In any case, my problem is that new users don't seem to be able to find both of the tags in most of the cases. So it's not a problem with mistagging  questions in general, but more of a problem with finding these two tags in particular.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We have been talking about this internally and I think we agree with the problem y'all are having but not the solution this question proposes. (Shog notified me that my first revision was, uh, unresearched.) The problem of people not being able to find a tag and therefore not asking is real and pervasive. We're just trying to find better solutions.


















Update: I liked Hakase's suggestion the best, so...

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/ask



The way I see it, y'all are caught between a rock and a hard place. https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1139/having-identification-request-and-retag-show-up-as-tag-suggestions-by-defaul/1140#1140Jon's right: retag is a crappy tag. Of course, that's the whole point: to exist just long enough for someone with tag-creation privileges to see it, get all sick and disgusted about it, and replace it with something better.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request is a necessary evil - ya definitely don't want folks using it any more than they need to, but when they're actually asking an identification question... They better use the right tag.

The problem is, it's not really possible to convey any of that in that little bit of tag suggestion text. All you can really say is "these are examples of tags". And then... You'd be giving them the two worst possible examples. Without any guidance on how/why they should be used.

Yeah. Your lives suck. Tagging-wise. You have my sympathy...

But! There may be hope...


  However, many new users seem to either use completely random tags for either of the above, or to recur to anime-production many times.


And why would they do that? Well, because the most obvious tag is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime - and that's not available. So the next best thing is any ol' tag that starts with anime, right? Well, no. But that's what they go with given no other options

So, what if we just attached a bit of guidance to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime? Like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1083/improve-question-quality-by-informing-users-of-reverse-image-search-sites/1084#1084we already did for identification, but without the ability to actually submit the question that way - something like, "if you can't find the right tag, use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag and we'll make one for you!" I'm just thinking out loud; come up with some better guidance for lost and I'll wire it up to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mangamanga... Then we can see if it works.

Use [tag:identification-request] if you want help identifying a series; or [tag:retag] if you need us to create a new tag for you." showing up whenever someone types "anime"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any reason, why you used code and not tag formatting for most tags in the new help blurb?


















After a bit of thinking I noticed that there is a huge stupid hint that doesn't provide a lot of help to new users. Just look at the original text. The first paragraph doesn't even answer the question "how to tag". This is what I came up with (some more editing and it could be a lot more helpful):



Special tags are https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/terminologyterminology, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes or any other tag that is not about any one specific anime or manga work.

There's no need to add new functionality or anything. We just need to edit that horribly unhelpful hint box that takes up so much space and helps so little right now.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My biggest concern is that people never read stuff anyway. Realistically, I think we can expect less than 10% of people to even notice that bar on the side, and 10% of those to actually read it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We shouldn't just go "nobody ever reads anything anyway" and not improve what clearly needs improvement. Let's do the best we can and let the 10% who read have a better user experience.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also people stop reading precisely because hints are useless. I remember the first time I read everything because most things seemed useful. When the majority of hints and popups feels useful, people read more, just like if it's mostly useless, people stop reading anything. So if we make this, the percentage of people reading  should rise.


















This is the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14801/who-is-lucas-akimotohttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14801/who-is-lucas-akimoto and the https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/14801/revisionsrevision history.

I'm not sure if the removal of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismsymbolism is correct.

The question is asking whether a character in the anime is a reference to something, which I think is ill-fit for the description of the tag (emphasis mine):


  This tag is for questions looking for meanings, either explicit or subject to interpretation, behind a character, a setting, an action of a character, a plot point.


What do you guys think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Am I right in removing the [symbolism] tag from this question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe removing it is correct. Questions about characters should fall within the general scope of a series tag. The series tag takes precedence before anything, if applicable. The Soul Eater question doesn't need it per say as it i asking about a specific reference. Take a look at [this meta](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/929/somebody-please-clarify-the-symbolism-tag-wiki) if you wish to discuss specifics of the tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've thought for a while that [tag:symbolism] is too vague and broad to be a good tag. On the other hand, [the last time](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/896/should-we-get-rid-of-the-symbolism-tag) we debated this on meta, there was no consensus. At the very least, I think you should be safe removing it if the question clearly has little to do with symbolism. In this case, the OP is asking about a possible reference, which is rather different IMO. So, in short, I agree with your interpretation.


















Recently, I've noticed that lots of id requests are getting resolved without any real answers posted. Either someone's stab in the dark comment turns out to be right, or the OP puts in a little more research and finds the title, then shows up and puts it in a comment. In both cases, once the OP knows the answer, he or she scampers off without posting an answer and can't be reached.

This bugs me. I want questions to have real answers if they've been answered; I don't want answers buried in the comment threads on wrong answers. If that wrong answer gets deleted, there goes the real answer. I don't want answers buried in the comment thread on the question itself either. I want real answers with substantive content, something that could potentially help other users if they're looking for the same series and remembered different things about it. 

Does this bother anyone else, and if so, what should we do? In one instance, I wrote an answer based on what the OP put in the comments, after it became fairly clear the OP was gone and wasn't coming back. Now there's a real answer, but I didn't discover it, yet I'm getting rep for it, which doesn't seem right. In another instance, another user discovered the series and posted a real answer after the OP had found it, because the OP put that information at the bottom of a long comment thread on another, wrong, answer. I'm glad we got that real answer, but it was probably annoying to that user to find that all the effort put into answering the question was unneeded by the OP.

Some ideas I had for what to do in these cases:


Free-for-all: The first user to notice gets to post an answer and gain rep.
Community wiki: Write the answer and make it community wiki.
Delete: The questions aren't useful, so get rid of them.
Nothing: I'm the only weirdo who is bothered by this.
Something else: Give me your ideas!


What does the community think is the best way to deal with this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should we do about "dangling" id requests?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with ton.yeung's answer below (CW), and I've done it [here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/14534/49) some time ago. If the OP (in that case, whoever found the answer otherwise) decides to show up and answer the question, the CW is deleted and the person who really found the answer can get the credit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat I like Madara's answer, and it has the most upvotes, but my gut says CW is right and you make a very good argument for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Either way, Madara's answer does not go against CW, it simply says that you should answer even if you weren't the one who found the answer. Now if you choose to use a regular answer or a CW is up to you, either way is fine, as long as the question gets answered. If it bothers you to get rep for it not having found the answer, go for CW; if it's completely indifferent to you, go for a regular. In any case, I go for CW :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Can I write your comment up as an answer? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, no problem. I'd write it now, but I'm short on time.


















My vote is for community wiki.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That was my first thought too, but the community here didn't seem to have any solid guidelines on when to use CW like Math.SE does, and SFF.SE never seems to use it either. Maybe we can all have another discussion about how to use community wiki.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this. If the user who really found the answer decides to show up later on and post an answer, the CW can always be deleted and credit given to the due user.


















This is a common problem. Comments are meant for clarification and improvement for the question, if you choose to answer in the comments, you take the risk of someone actually posting it as an answer.

If you see someone answering in a comment, especially if they don't migrate it to an answer later, feel free to answer yourself.

Of course, it still needs to be a detailed answer, include plot points, images and anything else that might improve the quality of the answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding your last paragraph: definitely; the lack of good, detailed answers is why this issue bothers me so much.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As much as I want it to be a detailed answer, writing one would take too much time. While it doesn't take much time to throw in a template answer, finding the exact episode/chapter and cite them takes 30 minutes to hours.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh In my view, even a template answer is a big improvement on a one-line answer hidden at the bottom of a string of comments. Even an answer with the title and a link to our tag wiki would be a big improvement.


















Seeing as we seem to be accepting Final Fantasy tagged plot-based questions, and the fact that each game is in its own self contained universe - should we change the existing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasyfinal-fantasy tag into several?

Example: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasy-vifinal-fantasy-vi,https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasy-viifinal-fantasy-vii,https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasy-viiifinal-fantasy-viii,https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasy-xfinal-fantasy-xhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasy-xiifinal-fantasy-xii,https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasy-xiiifinal-fantasy-xiii, etc.

And perhaps keep the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/final-fantasyfinal-fantasy tag for questions that are about the series as a whole or do not fit comfortably into the series (spin off titles like crystal chronicles for example)

What are opinions on this? I personally can see myself using these split ones as favourite tags as I have played through some, but not all of the games. 

It's still a new enough set of questions, but we could pre-emptively change this rather than having to go back and fix it
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have separate tags for each major Final Fantasy game?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I remember that tag separation is done according to expert separation. So if the people who know about thing A might not know anything about thing B, it's probably a good idea to use separate tags. But FF game series players are probably aware of what's going on in all the games, so probably keep it all under one tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think someone who has played FF7 and FF8 nessicarily knows anything about the plotlines in FF9. There is some knowledge that copies over, but most of this is game mechanics and an occasional chocobob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko Good point, I played FF6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but I've never finished the first five and I've never gone near any of the newer ones, so I for one wouldn't have the slightest idea how to answer a question about, say, FF12.


















This was discussed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/35/49here a long time ago, and the post seems to suggest no consensus was reached (since there's a lot of debate on comments as well, and ultimately no answer was accepted). Further debate may have taken place in chat, because I seem to recall that in the end the decision was to make whichever title was more popular the one we use. So basically, it would mean that each case should be individually assessed.
Nevertheless, I have now created a synonym for that, and whichever language we choose for each tag, the advisable thing to do would be to create a synonym for the alternative title.  

Also, if you notice the https://anime.stackexchange.com/revisions/15191/2edit description when the tag on you question was changed, it says "Retagging to [parasyte] since it's better known in English by that title".
We cannot forget we're an English language community, so we should keep in mind what the best known title is for (most) English speakers.

As for you knowing and choosing which of the title is more popular, I say that's the least of our problems. If you end up creating a tag with the less popular title, either someone who is sure the other title is more popular will retag it for you; or if people are unsure, the matter will most certainly pop up in our main chat room, and a consensus will generally be reached (this has happened some times in the past).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this case I think parasyte is much more well known than kiseijuu-sei-no-kakuritsu. But how can you determine every time which one is more popular?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've edited my answer to address that issue.


















I want to ask a question about some anime series which is divided to few similar questions.
So to make it more efficient, I thought to assemble all of them to the same question page.
I think it will be less contradicting one another if so.  

Let's say for example:  


What are the differences (in general) between the light novel and the
manga of the series X?
Where is the season 2 ends up in the light novel and where in the
manga?
Is the manga reaches to the end of the light novel?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it alright to write a title like "some question about X anime series"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please edit in an example. It's hard to say anything without.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I have edit the question.


















Thanks to everyone for your input. I'll summarize the points made so far. As @Madara Uchiha says, if someone finds the answer and then posts it in a comment without writing a real answer, we should feel free to write our own answers. As @JNat said in comments, we can write a regular answer or a community wiki answer, as suggested by @ton.yeung. If it bothers you to get reputation for an answer you didn't write, use community wiki; if you don't have a problem with that, write a regular answer. 

Either way, the most important thing is that the question gets answered. As @nhahtdh brought up, it's quick to put up a template answer with a link to Wikipedia, but it takes much longer to track down which episodes/chapters had the exact events that the OP refers to. But even a template answer is better than a title hidden at the bottom of a comment thread, so as long as the template answer contains some of the points from the OP's description, we shouldn't be afraid to slap one up so the question has a real answer. And of course, if you're cruising the site looking for something to do, you can edit the answer to add more detail.

I saw https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/q/10083/30879this Meta on Arquade talking about Winterbash 2014


  We have been given the option this year to opt out of this year's Winterbash. The default is opt-in, so if we do nothing or can't decide, we will get hats. However if we decide that we definitely do not want hats, we can make sure the site remains hat-free until at least a year's time.


Now I am unsure if we have been given the option and I have a feeling https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/24/logan-ma certain someone who won http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/leaderboard/network?page=1network wide last year may want to revive the madness if given the option

So a couple of questions. 


do we have the option to opt-out of Winterbash 2014?
if we can opt-out, should we?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we hate hats?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think there should be more hat collusion this year.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't worry about me. It was my first time doing Winter Bash, so I had to go a bit crazy to get everything. Now that I have some experience with it and know what I'm doing, I shouldn't need to go as crazy to repeat my performance from last year.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That is Arqade*


















As a site, we will participate in the Winter Bash this year (unless serious objections are raised). 

Each individual users have a "I hate hats" link that will opt him out of the event.

Do we post it in the Bio section of our profile and if so does it matter where we place it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it's anything like last year, the "I hate hats" link will be at the footer of every page.


















Some SO sites do have a sandbox for questions (for example Code Golf)... 

There are some interpretative questions I would like to ask, but since they cannot be answered via Word of God, there is always the chance people will misunderstand and flag/downvote it just by skimming it.

So, is there a sandbox in anime.se?

The is because we don't get the same volume of request as the sites you've mentions and that many of the more frequennt users tend to hang out in the chatroom more than meta -- optimizing the visibility and response to the nature of your prospective question.


















Currently, we have https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/200177/updated-procedure-for-reporting-scrapersthe policy of using https://anime.stackexchange.com/contactthe contact form to report sites scraping our content.

However, if we go to the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/contactcontact us page link on the bottom of the page, there is no option under "What can we help you with?" indicating that we can do this, aside from selecting the "Other" option, nor is there a Help Center topic about this: https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/search?q=scrapinghttps://anime.stackexchange.com/help/search?q=scraping

For an experienced user, this might not be a problem to search meta for this, but this might confuse new users as to what they can do when they find a site scraping content from Stack Exchange. At the very least I would like to request a new topic be added in the contact form about this.

I see most of the time comparing the art style. This anime/manga is similar to art style of that anime/manga. And there are some question where name of art style are asked like:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/15511/is-there-a-name-to-the-art-style-used-in-no-game-no-lifeIs there a name to the art style used in No Game No Life?

I guess what you're worried about here are spoilers. This has come up at least a couple times before for me, and I'm sure also for other users.

Generally, our standards are to answer the question asked in the best way possible, even if it requires information which the asker may not be aware of. This can lead to spoilers. In answers, it's common courtesy to write such spoiler information inside spoiler tags, which you can include by typing >! at the beginning of a paragraph. The result will look like this:


   This is spoiler text.


The reasoning for this is that it's more important that the answer be on the page than that the OP not be spoiled. The OP is just one person asking a question, but there can be hundreds or thousands more who reach the same question via Google and want to know the answer.

Of course, answerers don't always follow this. Even when they do, it's not hard to accidentally see things you don't want to see. So a good rule of thumb is to not ask unless you really want to know the answer, even if it means you might see some spoilers.

In some cases, if a question is very clearly answered later, it may be better to first post a comment stating that this is answered later in the series, preferably with some reference to episode/chapter number. That way the asker will know that they can just keep going forward in the series and will eventually have their answer, and they'll know that if they keep their question open and read the answers they're risking being spoiled. But so long as the question isn't deleted, it still needs to receive an accurate answer, and a comment like "this is answered in episode 8, go watch up until that point" is typically not an answer by our standards (though it is fine as a comment).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think I get it: the quality and validity of a question aren't necessarily correlated with the reasoning behind why it was asked. Also, the point isn't to answer the question just for the OP alone, but for anyone who has the same question and wants to see the answer. Is that right? Sorry if my newbie is showing a bit too much.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SecretEvilRadio Yeah that's the idea. It's pretty much the same as other SE sites that we're optimizing for the visitors on the page rather than just the asker, but since we're not about any sort of a technical topic that can seem weird to people I guess.


















https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZYYI.pngOne of the hats for http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/Winter Bash 2014 is titled "Naruto", and has the description

Having never watched Naruto, I'm curious what the joke here is.

(Should this go here or on the main site? Beats me; migrate if you see fit.)

I don't get it either, but I've also not seen the series.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5maybe because Naruto want to be Hokage and didn't have any friend at first?

Naruto was (eventually) accepted even though he was lonely for most of his childhood. I'm guessing it's something like that. Probably one of Oded's conceptions.

It is not possible under normal circumstances to track this, by design. Voting is intended to be anonymous. Under certain circumstances, you may be able to guess who the voter is, but there's no built-in way in the software for anyone other than a developer to tell who voted on your posts, and even for developers it isn't easy. You can, however, check who favorited your question via http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/205985/who-favorited-meData Explorer. 

Moderators can look for trends in voting to detect serial voting, which is not allowed. In addition, some badges (and https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/9260/sarenyayour profile page) reveal some very coarse information about your own voting preferences. There's no way for a user here to reconstruct who voted for them solely based on that, and that is very much intended.

I'm wondering if there exist any English subtitle search engines that allow to find out what anime a certain line of dialogue was spoken in. This could greatly help identify anime, if a certain specific phrase is all you can remember. 

There is currently a somewhat useful way of searching subs using Google: add filetype:srt, filetype:ssa or filetype:ass to the search query to only look within the files of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubStation_Alphaaccording format. But Google isn't allmighty and the results are very incomplete. Is there a better alternative?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are there any subtitle search engines?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might want to ping @snailboat in [the Japanese Language chatroom](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/511/japanese-language) - I'm pretty sure he's mentioned either knowing of a search engine or maybe just having a large local repository of subtitles.


















It may have already been suggested or may exists if so I apologise, but if not I was thinking it might be a nice idea to have a section give a basic description of the different genres of manga/anime. Because some are more well know than others and it'd save people having to ask?

For internal consistency's sake, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jojo-no-kimyouna-boukenjojo-no-kimyouna-bouken should be either https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jojono-kimyouna-boukenjojono-kimyouna-bouken or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jojo-no-kimyou-na-boukenjojo-no-kimyou-na-bouken.

We're primarily an English language site. So we should prioritize the English series names over the non-English ones when an official title is made available and synonymize the other non-English versions. SEO wise the romanized Japanese tags would probably have better visibility due to factors such as age. While the effort to keep our tag grammatically correct is appreciate, I don't believe that minor tag changes would have significant impact on the searchability of content on our site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ I mean, sure, it won't have a significant impact, but it still bugs me!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Instead, I think we should take a moment and look at who we think our target audience is currently and how we want to go from there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Anyway, that is probably a discussion for a separate post, but the heuristic we should be working off is "what title is best known by English speakers?". For JoJo, this should probably be `jojos-bizarre-adventure`, but for other shows like Nichijou, `nichijou` is clearly superior to `my-ordinary-life`.

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1063/is-it-feasible-to-keep-identification-request-questions-going-as-they-are-nowKrazer's post from July 2014 about identification requests asked the following question:

Do [identification-request questions] attract so-called "help vampires" that plague much of the Stack Exchange network of sites (especially Stack Overflow)?

That is, do identification-request questions attract users to the site that consume the time of answerers, while not contributing back to the site?
It sure looks like they do!
Here are some data about participation of users whose first post (meaning "question or answer", i.e. comments ignored) on the site was...

...an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261681/vampires1data for "category 1"
...in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bleachbleach, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/one-pieceone-piece, or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist (these four tags together have about as many questions as identification-request, though significantly fewer users): http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261705/vampires2data for "category 2"
...any question: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261735/vampires3data for "category 3"

All of these exclude users who created their accounts less than 4 weeks before the latest data dump was imported to SEDE, as well as users who created their accounts during the site's private beta.

Consider the following summary statistics:

╔══════╦════════════════════════╦═════════════════════╦═════════════════════════════╗
║      ║ Asked other questions? ║ Posted any answers? ║ Commented on non-own posts? ║
╠══════╬════════════════════════╬═════════════════════╬═════════════════════════════╣
║ cat1 ║  42 ->  8%             ║  45 ->  8%          ║ 161 -> 30%                  ║
║ cat2 ║  53 -> 39%             ║  33 -> 24%          ║  69 -> 51%                  ║
║ cat3 ║ 184 -> 19%             ║ 153 -> 16%          ║ 367 -> 37%                  ║
╚══════╩════════════════════════╩═════════════════════╩═════════════════════════════╝

It comes as no surprise that category 1 users (people whose first post was an id-request question) contribute less to the site in aggregate than category 2 users (people whose first post was a big-3 or FMA question) or category 3 users (people whose first post was a question of any kind).
Data becomes very sparse as you look for more fine-grained statistics (since we're still a small site), but a glance at the histograms for the various columns in the SEDE queries universally has the right tail being meatier for categories 2 and 3 than for category 1, indicating, again, that category 1 users are (on average) more vampiric.

I will now take a moment to reiterate all the reasons I'm aware of that we should ban identification-request questions:

https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/32/identify-this-movie-questions/75#75They do not make the site interesting and bore the site's users.
Voters don't like these questions, as evidence by http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/160176/average-score-for-questions-and-answers-by-tagthe low score of identification-request questions relative to questions on other popular tags (sort by "# Ans" to see this more clearly). [http://data.stackexchange.com/scifi/query/160176/average-score-for-questions-and-answers-by-tagOn SF&F: same deal.]
Many of these questions go unanswered - http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/172449/tagged-zombie-timeseries?Weeks=52&TopTags=15#graphthey're zombies. [http://data.stackexchange.com/scifi/query/172449/tagged-zombie-timeseries#graphOn SF&F: even worse.]
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261651/the-identification-requests-are-taking-over-cumulative?TagName=identification-request#graphFully 20% of the questions on this site are now identification-request questions - and http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261652/the-identification-requests-are-taking-over-averaged-instantaneous?TagName=identification-request#graphthis trend is accelerating! (Why is this bad? A superabundance of questions on any one topic makes a site unpalatable to users who don't like that topic. Would you enjoy Stack Overflow if it was brimming with COBOL questions?) [On SF&F: http://data.stackexchange.com/scifi/query/261652/the-identification-requests-are-taking-over-averaged-instantaneous?TagName=story-identification#graphthe fraction of identification requests increased for a while but then leveled off.]
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261772/the-vampire-flies-away?Param=132% of identification requests that received an answer within 24 hours have no response from the OP (in the form of a comment or accepted answer). http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261772/the-vampire-flies-away?Param=2The corresponding figure for the site as a whole is 17%. http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261772?Param=3For the site minus ID requests, it's just 13%. [On SF&F: http://data.stackexchange.com/scifi/query/261787?Param=127% for ID requests; http://data.stackexchange.com/scifi/query/261787?Param=114% for the site as a whole]
Lots of identification requests have been showing up in the Hot Network Questions sidebar lately. This is bad, because this makes our site look dumb to users on other sites in the SE network. (Unfortunately, this is anecdotal, because I don't have data about what has being showing up in HNQs lately. I know Logan was keeping track of this stuff at some point in the past - maybe he still is?)
Many identification-request questions are tantamount to "can you read my mind?", or worse, "can you read the mind of my friend, on behalf of whom I'm asking this question for some bizarre and utterly incomprehensible reason?". Christ. Arqade has banned "game-identification" questions that lack an audiovisual artifact. They've been doing this longer than we have. I think they know what they're doing. (Comparisons to Movies.SE would be helpful, but running similar tag-based analyses there is unfortunately intractable because of the absurd amount of meta-tags they have.)
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1084/1908Despite there now being a popup thing that tells you to try reverse image searching, some people just aren't doing that (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/17161/1908one, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/17085/1908two, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/17010/which-anime-is-this-child-wearing-headphones-fromthree). Yes, some of these will end up only giving you Japanese or Chinese results, which the OP may not be able to read, but quite frankly, if you really care what an image is, I expect you to at least run it through Google Translate and see what that tells you (i.e. I basically subscribe to the Jeff Atwood school of thought: posting on Stack Exchange should be what you do after you've exhausted every other option available to you). What this tells me is that allowing identification requests is attracting lazy people to the site, and we don't want lazy people.
Identification requests generally don't get very many views (despite prurient identification requests yielding large positive outliers, as I point out further below): http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261783out of 61 tags with at least 10 questions, identification-request questions are the 7th-least-viewed in aggregate on a per-question basis. (This assumes that a question with V views tagged with A and B adds V to the total view count for both A and B. This is imperfect, but I'm not sure what works better.) Alone, this is no argument (we don't want to get rid of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nanohananoha, after all), but seriously, these questions aren't (and by nature, cannot be) helpful to future viewers. If they were, they'd be viewing them!

Other things that peeve me about identification requests:

We have a steady stream of people posting things that are just vaguely anime-style that we end up having to trace back to some rando's original art on pixiv. Super-useful, right?
Most of http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261782/highly-viewed-id-requestsour highly-viewed identification requests appeal to a rather prurient interest. 6 of the top 10 strike me as prurient:

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do identification-request questions attract users that don't contribute to the site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't understand why you are comparing us to sites like SO with very different scope and needs. If you compare us to [Scifi](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/) or [Movies & TV](http://movies.stackexchange.com/) you'll see that our rate of identification questions is pretty normal (actually much lower than Movies & TV's), and those sites seem like much more reasonable goals to aspire to than just blindly trying to follow SO logic. But your examples are examples of another issue which I intend to bring up in the next day or two with many questions and why the current guidelines are flawed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM There are only two references to SO in there - (1) Krazer's question from the previous post; and (2) a throwaway remark about COBOL. I would think that regarding (1), help vampires are universally undesirable; and regarding (2), the point could just as well be made about any site - a lack of diverse content is boring. I didn't think to look at SF&F; I'll update this with some statistics from over there for comparison.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The entire concept of "help vampire" is SO-specific jargon that means nothing unless you view SE in that lens.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Sure, it's a phenomenon that is obviously most prevalent on SO, but the notion [predates Stack Overflow](http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/) and can be a feature of any internet community that provides "help". If you'd prefer, this could just as well read "Do identification-request questions attract users who don't contribute to the site?".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess we're debating semantics at this point. I'm fine with saying that identification requests will attract users who don't contribute as much as other users on average, but I don't have any problem with such users coming and going as they choose. The term "help vampire" to me implies a negative connotation, as well as the idea that the person consistently produces low-quality questions which aren't useful to anyone else, and that such users are not desirable. That isn't what I see from these users, or even how I view our role here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Sure, that's a fair point of view (though I disagree with it). I've reworded the title to explicitly describe the kind of users we're talking about here rather than calling them "help vampires".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If prurient id requests get the most views, we should just ban non-prurient id requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I, coming from a site that is also *flooded* with this shit, have another reason in addition to the very good ones you already have: They are not improvable by the community. Whenever a new user, who might not be the best asker yet, posts a question, it can always be improved to a better state by anyone in the community, as long as the general idea of the question is clear. But with ID questions this is just not possible, except for grammar and spelling stuff. You can't ever improve the content of the question without the original asker, and let's face it, they'll usually not do it themselves.


















I've noticed a trend among regular Stack Overflow users which, as someone who doesn't use SO, is frankly bizarre. SO users tend to think of SO (and by extension all SE sites) as a battleground between "good questions" and "help vampire questions". They think the people asking for help are lowering the quality of the site, and will ultimately lead to the site being unusable, by good questions not getting the spotlight they deserve.

That may be the case on SO, but there is no battleground here. Questions are not starved for attention. We only get around 10 questions per day, and many of these are seen by the regular users here. Even questions with low view counts still typically get to around 100, and nearly 1/6 of all our questions have passed 1000 views. I have no trouble reading all of them except a few series I don't follow. Of all the sites in the network we could become, SO is number 1 on my list of SE sites I hope we don't become like. This is a recreational site about several media of entertainment. If we take ourselves as seriously as SO, it would simply not be fun, and there's no point to this site if it isn't any fun. The problems they face there, with not enough users to answer all the questions (even the well-written ones) are problems which I would just give up on if they were here, and I'm someone who is rather dedicated to this site. I have a hard time believing we'll ever be much like SO, or that it would be a good thing for us to try to be. So to me, the idea that people who aren't "contributing" and "only" ask one question is very strange: that question is already a contribution!

More to the point though, that's really what we're here for: to help people with questions about anime. That's in fact the only reason we're here. There are no "help vampires". There are people who want answers to questions about anime. Some of them ask questions well, and some poorly, but we ideally want all of them to get their answers here, and in the exceptionally poor cases we'll send it back to the OP saying that the question needs work and hopefully offering constructive criticism. If the user sticks around, that's great, but they are definitely not under any obligation or anything of the sort, and we shouldn't count them as bad if they don't feel like sticking around.

Your analysis shows that users whose first questions are https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions post fewer posts on average than the site. I don't see why that's a problem. We're a question and answer site. There can't be answers without questions. Each question is fundamentally keeping this site just a little bit more alive and active. If a user only feels like asking one question and gets their answer here, that's still a net positive for us. Sure, I'd love it if everyone stuck around, but not everyone particularly wants to. If the only way we can help them is by identifying an anime for them, that's still something.

And ID requests are helping people, whether or not you like it. For one, when we answer them correctly (which is not all that much less often than the site average), we help the OP. In addition, I (and several other regular users) have found them useful for purposes other than the OP's original one, e.g. to discover new series I was not aware of. This is extremely rare outside https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, but not uncommon while browsing it. You may say that "this isn't what the question was for", but you can't deny that it's still a helpful source.

It's not unheard of for identification requests to actually get a significant number of hits, presumably by people looking for the same series. Look at https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/809/anime-with-a-little-red-haired-character-who-pilots-a-racing-podAnime with a little red haired character who pilots a racing pod or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7876/where-is-see-you-space-cowboy-fromWhere is "See you Space Cowboy" from? for two examples. Yes, this is rarer than for other tags, if by "other tags" we mean mostly things like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto. But if you look at questions on tags with only a few uses (e.g. obscure manga series from decades ago) I think you'd be hard-pressed to claim the situation a whole lot worse there.

The really big sin of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request is that they're grouped in a way that makes it easy to think there's something wrong and target specifically. It's a big tag without the following and compiled knowledge-base of a big-name series. If you look at the tag alone, it looks huge. It has more questions than https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto. And it has a lower answer rate than any of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bleachbleach, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/one-pieceone-piece, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist. Wow, it must be terrible, right? No, in fact, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request's 87.1% answer rate is almost the same as the site-wide rate of 87.5%. The oddballs here are the mega-popular series which have a combined 98.7% answer rate.  

But identification questions are generally about pretty obscure stuff, so it only makes sense that the answer rate would be similar to the more obscure stuff which is more representative of our site as a whole than those few extraordinary tags. We aren't going to get 20% of our incoming identification requests looking for Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, or FMA no matter what we do, so the less popular series are over-represented in the tag. Relative to our site-wide stats identification requests are pretty much average in terms of answer ratio, but it's hard to identify or target the other "problematic" questions because they're not yet statistically significant or worth the effort. Likewise, the views on most identification requests aren't stellar, but they're only particularly bad when you compare them to other big tags; if you look at the site in full they're not terrible, though admittedly below average (but still above what a question would get on SO). Much the same story holds for the scores in the tag. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request looks like a bundle of really bad questions when compared to the likes of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, but it's more of a bundle of fairly average questions compared to the site as a whole, and removing it doesn't really help our average stats appreciably.

Moreover, deciding whether or not a topic is a good fit based on this kind of statistical analysis seems profoundly backwards to me. Statistics like traffic are only useful for understanding trends in the absence of any major changes to the site. If we keep the policy and enforcement the same, an improvement in answer rate is a good thing. But it's a good thing because it means we're helping more people. Changing the policy simply because this stat will improve isn't helping more people, it's trying to game the stats. We should be thinking about in what way we can help the most people, and to me, none of the arguments I've heard presented here or anywhere else are convincing that the answer isn't to "allow good questions, both on identification and on other topics".



Now, with all that said, I do agree that there's a limited (but perhaps growing) problem, not with identification requests as a whole, but specifically with unanswerable identification requests, and a seeming inability to separate these from the acceptable ones via voting and/or closing. This is a real problem and in my mind requires some action. Some questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request are just a dump of a couple random disjoint plot points that aren't even memorable, and the OP expects us to read their mind. Even if users here know the series which is being asked about (which we probably do in many cases), we wouldn't be able to answer it. That is a problem, and frankly, our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questionsexisting criteria don't cut it when it comes to doing this. Quite often a question will get by on a technicality when I actually check these. Other times, a perfectly answerable question (e.g. one containing a complete plot summary of a unique series) nonetheless doesn't technically fit.

I've thought a lot about this over the past month or so and have a fairly concrete proposal for a modification to the guidelines which I think will alleviate a lot of this. I'm intending to post this proposal in the very near future (to spoil it a bit, it's a modification of my earlier proposal at https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/783/what-kind-of-policy-should-we-adopt-for-current-and-future-identification-reque/792#792What kind of policy should we adopt for current and future "identification-request" questions with no audiovisual artefacts? from before we had any concrete guidelines, adapted and simplified to make it easy to decide). It also fixes much of the issue of repetitive/non-descriptive titles. I've been testing this for some time now and I found that in about 90% of cases I could immediately determine in seconds if a question was good or if it needed more detail. My intent is to post this suggestion in the next day or two if there are no major delays.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really enjoy reading you walls of texts. You may have changed my mind, if even for a bit, regarding these types of questions. I'm looking forward to reading your proposed revision to the id request criteria.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, the reason I pointed out those various statistics is not because I think they are, in and of themselves, reasons to do away with ID requests. Rather, they are proxies for factors like user opinions (votes - "do I like this content?") and external usefulness (views - "do other people have a use for this content?"). What I'm getting at is that it's _those_ factors that suggest we may ought to change our treatment of ID requests. Like you, I don't see gaming site statistics as a useful goal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aside: in the particular case of the "See you space cowboy" question, the reason that has a lot of views is almost certainly that it was in HNQs for a while (i.e. the source probably isn't search engines, but rather users on other SE sites that have seen or are aware of Cowboy Bebop).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that we'll never have SO-scale problems, and I agree it's inconceivable that bad questions (of any kind, ID request or not) could become so prevalent as to completely stonewall the answering of good questions (as has come close to happening on SO at times). Nonetheless, answerer time and energy are limited resources. This site is certainly not done growing, and there could come a point where bad questions _do_ become an obstacle to the answering of good questions. This is a problem that I believe is best nipped in the bud. (But +1; I look forward to reading your proposal.)


















I actually have a few ideas on how to alleviate this problem, but I think to see most of them implemented would require effort from the part of Stack Exchange. Before I propose these ideas, I will cut to the chase and offer my opinion: it is feasible to keep identification request questions going as they are now, at least until this site leaves Beta. Granted, we need to be more stringent and add more QC guidelines and be more clear of what they are.

Option 1: Have a separate forum for identification requests

This could be a chat room or another Stack Exchange site reserved for identification requests. If such an SE site is formed, we could even merge Anime & Manga identification requests with those from Arqade and Movies & TVs, and just migrate all questions having only the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag to that site.

The current threshold to participate in the site's chat rooms is 20 reputations, which is not asking too much from the new users. We can even make this easier for them by rewarding reputations to users for completing the Tour. Now about the Tour: I really dislike it in its current unhelpful form. The site Tour should be more unique and tailored to Anime & Manga, and provide more incentives (e.g. privileges) for new users to complete them. More about this in the next section.

Option 2: Require new users to complete the Tour before they are able to ask identification request questions

When a user asks their first question, after they click on the Ask Question link, they should be brought to a page asking What is your question about? and a list of the 3–5 most popular tag names on the left and tag wikis on the right. The first in that list should be https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request. If they check that, they will be brought to the updated Tour page, in which they will learn about some useful tools for identification request questions such as Google Reverse Image Search for images and Shazam for music. Then give them some tests similar in nature to the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/157094/questions-about-review-testingreview tests (audits) that could test them some identification questions that could be answered using Google Reverse Image Search to check that they know their tools. If they fail too many times, they will be banned.

Option 2.5: Further require some reputations to ask identification request questions (does not apply to trusted users)

This is if we adopt Option 2 and want to be more strict about the qualities of identification request questions. We can also add one more restriction that they can not ask a second identification request question unless they accept or leave a comment on their first one, given that it has an answer with more than 2 upvotes. This is going a bit extreme, so it should be reserved for the time when the number of low quality identification request questions skyrocketed.

Option 3: Downvote and ignore more the bad questions

Unlocked, unanswered questions that have negative scores https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221/how-does-deleting-work-what-can-cause-a-post-to-be-deleted-and-what-does-that/5222#5222will be automatically deleted by the system after 30 days, and questions with -4 score or lower https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117119/how-many-downvotes-to-push-an-active-question-off-the-active-list/117120#117120won't show up on the front page. Plus, downvoting a question https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/93023/why-do-i-not-lose-reputation-when-i-downvote-posts/93024#93024doesn't cost one reputations, unlike downvoting an answer which does. Voting is easier and less time consuming than flagging and also saves the reviewers and moderators some time from unnecessary hassle.

If we bring it to chat room, we might as well kill the tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Option 3: This is the part I agree with, which uses already existing tool to curb the flow of bad identification requests. We have no need for underspecified questions, since they can generate multiple answers which leads to nowhere.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Option 2 is nice, but it depends a lot on SE to provide a way for each community to customize the Tour page outside the current rigid format. This probably will happen in 6 to 8 years.


















I sometimes look for general tags like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resourcesresources, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history on the Tags page of the main site and am overwhelmed by the series title tags that populate the pages. I suspect that if we separate the series title tags from the general tags, the general tags would only occupy no more than three pages. I propose on the grounds of user friendliness and usability that there be new tabs named all, general and series in addition to and replacing some of the currently existing popular, name and new tabs on the Tags page of the main site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Put series title tags in one group?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This involves a big change in the way the tag is stored, so I doubt it will get implemented any time soon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are a very small number of non-series tags on this site, and very few are created on an ongoing basis. If you think it would be helpful, we could always maintain a meta post with information about non-series tags (I was working on this at one point, but stopped for some reason that I no longer remember). nhahtdh is right in that there's plain no way this is going to get implemented as a baked-in feature of the tagging system.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin That is the way to go. I think this will benefit new users the most.

Links subject to link rot or the content of the link may change, therefore, all contents on SE must stand by itself even if the link is gone. However, even if the content can stand by itself, the link usually has some interesting additional content that is not related to the question/answer at hand, and sometimes, they are cited as the source of some claims or quotes.

It is inappropriate to quote everything in the post since it makes the post bloated and irrelevant, not mentioning possible copyright violation. Still, it might be interesting for future readers to check out the full content of the link or cross-check the cited source.

Some examples:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/17199/what-is-the-relation-between-the-female-protagonists-of-these-two-manga-seriesWhat is the relation between the female protagonists of these two manga series? (Since we are not sure whether it is true, the content might be removed on TvTropes in the future, leaving use without context).
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/17183/what-is-the-name-of-the-anime-manga-in-the-bottom-right-of-this-picture/17184#17184What is the name of the manga in the bottom right of this picture? (The link to Shounen Sunday is going to rot extremely soon)


Therefore, while it is not required, it is nice to save a copy of the page on the date that the question or answer is posted to preserve the context/source of citation so that the content on SE still makes sense in the future.

Is there any convenient way to archive a copy of an external webpage?

SE developers could make use of some http://robustlinks.mementoweb.org/tools/tools to combat link rot. These tools include http://amberlink.org/amber, a server-side plug-in that gives visitors a fallback option (mirrors) if links go dead, and https://github.com/renevoorburg/robustify.jsrobustify.js, a script that works in combination with a server-side script that checks whether links still work as they are being clicked and, if not, redirects the user to a snapshot in a web archive. Of course, a snapshot has to exist prior to the redirection; there are many http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/about/#findweb archives that can take snapshots of webpages, and versioning systems can take them http://robustlinks.mementoweb.org/spec/#data-attributesautomatically.



A local solution might be the https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozilla-archive-format/Mozilla Archive Format addon for Firefox. It can save and view webpages in both MHT and MAFF formats. An MAFF file is basically just MHT files compressed into one ZIP file, but opening it opens all saved webpages automatically in Firefox. One may also take screenshots and upload them to the i.stack.imgur account for better safekeeping, but the downsides of this approach should be very obvious.

There is no meaning if you are the only one who can view it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, currently there is no platform for archiving video or audio, so that is another problem... Those are quite problematic, since they are bumping into copyright issues. Anyway, I think archive.org is the most convenient web site available for archiving and showing the content to public. Having an archive without other people being able to access is just dead data.

Thank you Madara Uchiha!

It took a while to get here, but it finally arrived. Customs must have been curious about what my gift was too!

 

(Kyouko-censored)

Time to open :D



Padded with some Japanese newspaper. The sports section - there seems to have been some horse racing event on recently.



Turfy \o/

Now, back to the gift! After taking out the newspaper, there was.....



A figurine of Mikasa Ackerman from Attack On Titan! (At this point I was shaking - half with happiness/excitement, half because I had gone to the gym just before coming home to open it)

I carefully took her out of her encasing and started checking out poses and different accessories - She's very customizable :D



Mikasa is my first full size figurine ( I have a Yotsuba& keydongle and a tiny non-posable Lucky Star figure), So I am super happy to get my first one today ^__^. Here are some photos of Mikasa in action





I then had to eat, because I didn't realise so much time had passed!

I started getting into photography this year, so Mikasa will be my first model :D I looked up some guides online to improve my photos. There's lots I need to try doing - Different lighting, backgrounds, angles, ... I look forward to it :D

Myself and Mikasa are so happy we could die:

http://myanimelist.net/anime/6408/Bungaku_ShoujoBungaku Shoujo (Book Girl) [novel]

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bungaku-shoujobungaku-shoujo



Konoha Inoue was once a best-selling author under the female pseudonym Miu Inoue, but after a trauma, he quit writing, until he entered high school and happened to meet Touko Amano, the eccentric president of the Literature Club, who turns out to be a creature that eats books and tastes the stories. Konoha is recruited as Touko's personal writer/chef, crafting delicious snacks for her every day. But Touko is also nosy and active, so she has a tendency to get the two of them involved in mysteries and strange incidents that, surprisingly often, have a literary theme.

The series has a shoujo feel to it; there's a lot of drama, a lot of trauma, and a lot of interpersonal turmoil. The plots have the same artificed feeling as Victorian English literature such as the work of Dickens and the Brontë sisters; the second novel is directly inspired by Wuthering Heights, while the fourth novel is a very Victorian take on Phantom of the Opera starring modern Japanese high school students. As such, the stories can feel unrealistic and contrived; alternately, they're classically inspired and carefully crafted. It all depends which way you swing.

But it can't be denied that the art is gorgeous, and the characters are likable and unique, especially Touko, who is like a less obnoxious Haruhi crossed with Kami Nomi's Shiori Shiomiya. There are also anime based on the novels, in which Touko is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, if you're into that. If you enjoyed Clannad, Kanon, Chobits, or shoujo fantasy in general, you might like Bungaku Shoujo.

Just finished my first episode of Katanagatari... and then I got my gift, a Katanagatari art book!




and what's inside...





In Japanese! I need to learn how to read it :p

This is just for fun sake. Would love to see what is the most duplicated question? Some may question the reason behind it? It can be a learning link, where new user can see how two question may sound different but have similar meaning. What type of question not to ask. Further more when you type a question, the tab on top that shows "questions that may already have your answer" is not fool-proof. The best duplicate can be spotted on related question, which is after you have posted. That time either you realize or some one will flag your question.

One Outs [Anime, Manga]


  It's Light without a Death Note, but with a Baseball.


Our main character Tokuchi Toua, is pulled from an underground baseball gambling game called "One Outs" into the World of Professionally Baseball in Japan.

When signing for the team, he proposes the owner sign him on a performance-based contract to determine his yearly salary:
+5 million JPY per out he pitches.
-50 million JPY for every run he allows.

Baseball knowledge isn't really required to enjoy it - me being the example as I've never seen/played a baseball game in my life.

At least check it out on wiki/MAL...


  The story begins when Hiromichi Kojima, the star batter of the fictional Lycaons in 
Japan's Pacific League, heads to the southern Japanese island of Okinawa to train and bring himself out of a slump. There, he meets Toua Tokuchi, a 134-kmph (83 miles per hour) pitcher and the undisputed king of a gambling form of baseball called "One Out." At Kojima's urging, Tokuchi signs up with the Lycaons under an unusual contract: he gets 5,000,000 yen (about US$46,000) for every out he pitches, but loses 50,000,000 yen (US$460,000) for every run he gives up.

In the spirit of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1191/1908Winter 2015 series tags, I would like to promote the creation of tags for older series. As such, I think I want to start disbursing bounties to users that create tags for older series.
I have included a proposal below for doing this on a rolling season-by-season basis (starting with shows from summer 2011 [chosen arbitrarily - but this is obviously going to be more successful if we stick to the relatively recent past] that don't have tags), and would like some of you folks to take a look at it and see if it's reasonable - does it achieve the goal of getting more tags in the system without encouraging perverse behavior? Are there any grey areas I need to clarify? Are there any other changes I should make?
This proposal doesn't strictly require buy-in from other users, I guess, but I hope that this sounds like a good idea to the rest of the community. If any other high-rep users want to join in and help me award some bounties, that would be nifty, too.
If this works out, I imagine we can do something like one season a month or so, until we've hit all the seasons from Fall 2012 (i.e. when this site launched) back to Winter 2005 or so (this would take about three years, granted; I'm taking a long view of things here), perhaps pausing occasionally to focus on some other subset of anime, e.g. movies from a few-year period, or a particular studio's works, or a mega-franchise like Gundam, or whatnot.
There is precedent for this sort of thing on other Stack Exchange sites, though I can't for the life of me remember which ones. I think Code Golf might've been one of them?

(Title: Bounties for tags, summer 2011 edition)
How it's going to work
If you create a tag for one of the series on the list of approved series below (by asking a question with that tag), during the month of February 2015,4 I will award you a 50-reputation bounty, subject to certain conditions on you:

You must have posted at least one answer on the site with a score of at least 1.1
You must have less than 10,000 reputation on February 1, 2015.2

And also subject to certain conditions on the question you ask with the new tag:

The question must have received a net score of at least 3 by February 28 or 7 days after it was posted - whichever is later.3
The question must not be closed or deleted.

If you do not have https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsenough reputation to create a tag, that's fine - post the question anyway with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag and mention that you need somebody with more reputation to create the tag, and somebody will surely take care of that for you. I will give you (rather than the high-rep user who physically creates the tag) credit for creating the tag.
In the interest of getting broader participation, I will award at most 3 bounties (so, 150 reputation) to any given user.
If someone creates a tag but is disqualified from receiving a bounty for any of the reasons above, the bounty may still be awarded to the next user who asked a question in that tag, unless they are disqualified for some reason, in which case I'll go on to the next user, and so forth. So, if somebody "beats you to the punch", but you think their question is unlikely to get a high enough score by the deadline, and you think you have a better question, go ahead and post it! Who knows - you could well win the bounty.
These rules are subject to revision by me at any time and for any reason.6

Details
1 Bounties can only be awarded to answers, not questions, so it's impossible for me to award a bounty unless you've posted an answer somewhere. I ask for a score of 1 or more because I don't want to encourage people posting rubbish as an expedient for earning the bounty.
2 I also envision this as a redistributive mechanism; if you have at least 10,000 reputation, you will still have access to moderator tools after the site graduates, and so you aren't really in need of any rep redistribution.
3 The minimum score requirement is there because, again, I don't want to encourage people spamming terrible questions to earn bounties.
4 In any timezone, so from 12:00 UTC on Jan 31 to 12:00 UTC on Mar 1.
5 This list is derived from http://anichart.net/archive/summer-11AniChart's list of Summer 2011 shows. Series that already have tags are, of course, excluded.
6 This clause will probably only need to be in effect for the first iteration of this thing, to combat any degenerate behavior that ensues as a result of something I haven't foreseen. Once this is fully hashed out, we can drop this clause.

I totally forgot that this post existed.

I feel that the close reason for "Questions regarding future unannounced events" should apply to All future events. 

A typical question that is closed under this is: "Is 'My little sister can't be this potato' getting a second season?' 

If you don't know the series, you can't 100% confidently close this question - Maybe a season 2 was announced and you didn't know about it.

If you know the series you can close it or leave it open with confidence, because you likely have been keeping up with news on this topic. If you come to the question late however, and it is already closed - you could argue that It has been announced and therefore vote to reopen the question.

Having announced questions on-topic is inconsistent and also prone to becoming redundant over time. Can we apply the rule to all future events?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we change the name of this closure reason?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem you describe stays the same. When the new season came out, the "new" reason is just as inconsistent and redundant as the old one. You're exchanging one Problem for anotherb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5this is true, perhaps 'news events' or something similar is needed as a closure reason. I'll think about it some moreb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"If you come to the question late however, and it is already closed - you could argue that It has been announced and therefore vote to reopen the question." I don't see this as a problem. If it didn't have an answer/was off topic, it then has one/is on topic. We have one more answered question, and that's great. Am I looking at this the wrong way?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In general future events are subject to change, so questions can be accepted, but turn out to be wrong. And how many irregular users will update their answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As has been said before, answers will mostly be copy pasting of news sites. And this content is best left to themb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Stack Overflow has a somewhat similar problem to "future events are subject to change": they have answers that were accurate when first written, but currently refer to outdated versions of particular technologies, e.g. Clojure answers that recommend SLIME instead of Cider or cover the installation headaches from before Leiningen. SO seems to just leave it up to the community to make sure answers are up to date.

I've been thinking for quite a while now that maybe putting up a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentaihentai tag for eligible questions may be appropriate. For several reasons:


Users who don't want to see them can ignore them
These questions tend to be a slippery slope, so users who wish to moderate (as well as the moderators) can follow them
It can give us valuable metrics as to how many such questions are asked, by whom and about what.


A possible con is that in case the tag becomes too popular, questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentaihentai will have that appended to their titles.

What are your thoughts? Is it a good idea? A bad one? Do you have a better suggestion?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we want a [hentai] tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5let's try to define that allowed hentai scope so that new users can understand whether their question will be okay or notb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it's a bad meta tag that should not existb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase we al ready seem to have such thing right? http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/755/how-should-we-handle-potentially-nsfw-content-from-questions-and-answers/823#823 Non the less i think a specific hentai tag is a bad idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Why this should be bad?

I think it would be a good idea to have it purely for the reason that it allows for better categorization of questions.

Hentai is essentially its own sub-genre of anime and creating it will allow those interested to easily search for it OR avoid it as required and desired. Currently, you open a typical question titled "Who is this girl with the red hair?" and are then hit with a NSFW image you didn't know would be there - the tag would solve this problem and others similar.

To answer Hakase's comment, the scope of hentai is relatively straight forward. I'm sure most people have the level of common sense to know whether or not something is pornographic. Having said that, some To Love-ru Darkness OVA's are insanely close, but I wouldn't consider it Hentai.

So the tag is basically to separate those questions from the others.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So are you arguing that, contrary to Logan's view, the hentai tag should just be a tag attached to any question that contains NSFW content? I'm not agreeing or disagreeing, just wondering how you'd respond to Logan's argument.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda I'd +1 his answer and pretend I didn't post mine.


















TL; DR: No.
For multiple reasons:
First off: The Stackexchange Network is open for use by users from the age of 13 onwards. This introduces by legislation a responsibility to disallow inappropriate content for such participants, because pornography is considered harmful to minors.
Public display of pornography without a disclaimer notice is illegal in the US (which is the relevant legislation for SE)
Secondly: Does anime.stackexchange.com want to get known as hentai.stackexchange.com? If no, then we should consider clearly keeping that out. If only to shut up the critcism and condemnation by association that may happen from outside the network.
While anime certainly include ecchi and moe elements, hentai is flat out pornography. That's simply a different caliber. It's like comparing a cliché romance movie to ... (I think you got the idea)
Thirdly: Hell what benefit does it have? Do you really want to proudly announce: "I am the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hentaihentai-expert on anime.se!"?? I certainly wouldn't.
The point about statistics is IMO moot. If we don't have such questions yet (or rather not many), what is the point in collecting statistics?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A lot of this answer is conflating the presence of a [hentai] tag with posting pornography in a question. It simply isn't true that asking/answering a question about pornography is equivalent to posting pornography. The acceptability of questions about hentai isn't really what's being debated here, only the existence of a tag. I don't really like the idea of this tag very much, but I don't find these arguments convincing at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I kind of agree having a tag could legitimize hentai questions and attract more of them, which we may not want, but discussing porn and displaying porn are not the same at all. It's like the difference between a letter to Penthouse forum and an academic paper on the history of pornography.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to have to agree with you on this one.  I think it is best to not even acknowledge it.


















Are questions about VA's, producers, studios, etc. allowed on the main site?

While not about the actual subject material they are an integral part of the topic.

If there is no precedent for this, then maybe a better question would be:

Should these questions be allowed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions about people in the industry?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5what sort of questions were you envisioning?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We already have [tag:studio-ghibli], [tag:kyoto-animation], [tag:gainax], [tag:hideaki-anno], [tag:hayao-miyazaki], [tag:ken-akamatsu], [tag:makoto-shinkai], [tag:mamoru-hosoda], [tag:osamu-tezuka], [tag:mamoru-oshii], plus broader tags like [tag:voice-acting] and [tag:anime-production].


















Asking about the industry, its workings, its staff, and notable figures are all fine and on-topic. 

Asking about a notable figure's personal life, hobbies, etc, is a bit off-topic. But if it has a connection to a series or anime/manga production staff. It should be fine.

For an example, if I were to ask https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shirobakoshirobako "Are any of the characters in the anime based off real life people?" This is a perfectly acceptable question. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production "What productions did {{insert notable animation director}} work as key animator?" is also perfectly acceptable.

If I were to ask "What are {{insert notable voice actress}}'s three sizes?" This would be off topic for the site. If you're really curious and want to know, you can as this in our http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-main chatroom, where almost nothing is off-topic.

Absent any opposition to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2227/proposal-bounties-for-tagsmy proposal, I hereby announce the first iteration of the bounties-for-tags program.
How it's going to work
If you create a tag for a summer 2011 show (that's on the list of approved series below) by asking a question with that tag, I will award you a 50-reputation bounty (Which will be matched by Madara), provided that:

The question is posted during the month of February 2015.
The question receives a net score of at least +3 by March 7, 2015, and isn't closed or deleted. (we want good questions, not bad ones)
You have posted at least one answer on the site with a score of at least 0. (bounties can only be awarded to answers, not questions)
You have less than 10,000 reputation at the time of this posting. (this excludes Krazer / Jon Lin / Logan / Eric / Madara / kuwaly: no sense in making the rich richer)

If you do not have https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsenough reputation to create a tag (150 rep), that's fine - post the question anyway with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag and mention that you need somebody with more reputation to create the tag, and somebody will surely take care of that for you. I will give you (rather than the higher-rep user who physically creates the tag) credit for creating the tag.
In the interest of getting broader participation, I will award at most 4 bounties (so, 200 reputation) to any one user.
If someone creates a tag but is disqualified from receiving a bounty for any of the reasons above, the bounty may still be awarded to the next user who asked a question in that tag, unless they are disqualified for some reason, in which case I'll go on to the next user, and so forth. So, if somebody "beats you to the punch", but they already have >10k rep, or you think their question is unlikely to get a high enough score by the deadline, go ahead and post your question! Who knows - you could well win the bounty.
These rules are subject to revision by me at any time and for any reason. (But I probably won't unless I seriously overlooked something important.)
Approved series from summer 2011

Good morning/afternoon/evening people!

As a follow-up to our last https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/968/49Quarterly Feedback Survey (which, incidentally, has been more than a quarter away... oops), I hereby give you a link (now removed) (it has been posted in the chat room for over a week, but I remembered not everyone goes to chat) to a survey regarding the year that has passed. We want to know your opinions of what you thought went wrong and right on the year of 2014.

As with the previous survey, the process is completely anonymous and powered by Google Forms

Once again we'd like to get as many opinions as possible, so even if your opinion is negative or differs from everyone else's, we'd still like to know. So your honesty is also very important to us!

On the free text questions, please try to be as descriptive as possible, so that we can try to better assess the problems you may bring up.

Finally, the results will be posted as an answer to this question, as with the previous meta post (the first link above).

Thank you for your cooperation!



P.S.: As I mentioned above, the link has been available on http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-the main chat room since January 17th and we've already gathered some answers, so we'll leave the form open for (about) a week (or so) before we remove the link from this post, and let you guys know the results in an answer then! Thanks once again.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How did we do in 2014?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've posted the results below divided into two answers: one pertaining to how we did in 2014; and the other pertaining the other topics introduced for discussion, and up to debate on the next chat casts.


















My question is about this answer of mine: https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/600/122https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/600/122

It frequently gets edited by bots, replacing the content by stupid advertising. It's not a problem, because the edit always gets declined, but I get "spammed" with notifications.

I don't know where I can see declined edits for an answer, but here are some examples:

Are there other answers that are edited frequently? Is there a possibility to prevent that (like locking the answer)?

There are two cases that bother me:


A user made a very minor edit to a post, like capitalizing the i's or fixing one or two spelling or grammatical errors that don't impede reading nor understanding.
An anonymous user added more information to a question or answer. There's a chance that the edit was made by the post owner who didn't bother to log in, but it could also be someone else who might or might not have a clue about the content of the post they were editing (especially with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions, the added information might not even be about the same series as the one requested).


Should I accept or reject those suggestions, and on what grounds (which reason for rejection should I select)?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When to accept or reject a suggested edit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was about to ask the same question (1.), thanks for bringing this up. The help files don't really give directions for this. I like the idea of making the questions easier to read, the thing that bugs me about this is that it pushes older questions up the queue for no real reason (e.g. [here](https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/18631/revisions)).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mivilar That edit is really over the top. It's just replacing one word with its synonym, and the difference in meaning is minor and not important in that case. I don't mind the occasional bumping of old questions (some actually require more attention and voting), but I do mind the needless increase in revision number.


















Below are the overall results from the survey regarding how we did in 2014. There's a tl;dr version at the bottom, so you can skip the ginormous wall of text. I'm gonna try to keep the positive stuff a bit shorter, so as to reduce the length of the post, and to allow us to focus on what needs to be changed. If you feel anything was left out, either point it out, edit it in, or contact a https://anime.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsmod (we can create a private room to discuss, if you prefer). Also, feel free to comment on this answer, and open any individual meta posts on the topics mentioned here.

How did we do in 2014?

We received 12 answers to our survey, with an average score of 7.(45) (leaving out one user that did not answer), with scores ranging from 4 to 9.  

What did we do well?

Overall, we have been growing, both in content quality and number of users/visitors. The implementation of guidelines for id-requests was mentioned, also pointing out that they are flawed and may not work well for new users.
We have been gathering some more visibility from search engines, and have a good group of "engaged, knowledgeable, respectful and helpful users."
Also mentioned were: our chat rooms are fun; the mod/edit tools are good; a greater "interaction with community via events/question pushes"; and, of course, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1131/49our first ever gift exchange.

Where can we improve?

Despite the fact that in the previous section most of the users saw improvements on the general quality of our posts, low-quality of posts was also mentioned in this section. With particular emphasis on the id-requests. Their overall quality is bad (despite our guidelines), and most of them are asked by hit-and-run users. That means we need to "attract and keep good users". It was also suggested that we should try to make some sort of event for recommendations, thus possibly attracting some new users, whose tastes go "beyond Naruto, One Piece, and Death Note."
The overall visibility and clarity of how we work were brought up, with special attention to little attention toward meta posts, the fact that most people seem uneducated about voting and closing (and how they're not necessarily connected), how we seem to have some friction toward changing already implemented policies/guidelines, and how many of those guidelines are based on "well, we once allowed this..." kind of decisions. 
Users think we basically rather down-vote the bad stuff than up-vote the good stuff, sometimes take down-votes as a synonym for "should be closed", and many times don't close question that should be closed because of their number of up-votes.

How would you rank your moderators?

Of the 12 answers, one user did not rate us, the rest averaged 9.(09), ranging from 7 to 10. Looks like we did good ;) thank you

What can us mods do to improve?

Better engagement with the community, make decision confirmations clearer, and try to get our schedules to better complement each other. 

tl;dr

Good: We got a score of 7.(45)/10; the quality of posts improved, visitors/users number rose, greater overall visibility of the site; mods rated 9.(09)/10, need to improve on engagement with the community, making decision confirmations clearer, and try to get our schedules to better complement each other.
Bad: Hit-and-run users, overall quality of content (special focus on id-reqs), improve and enforce guidelines

With the above, the general opinions of users regarding the past year have been covered. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just a random taught, if most id requests are hit-n-runs. Couldn't we get some system, just like the protected question system. That users will first need like 10 rep before they are allowed to ask id-request questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx I don't think that's a very good idea (nevertheless, you should ask a full-fledged question here on meta). A more viable solution might be to disallow unregistered users from asking questions.


















Image identification-request is one of the most useful features of Anime and Manga StackExchange, when you are getting at the end of "Google-Image-Search".

Here an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/18463/what-is-this-picture-of-a-smiling-man-fromexample.

But sometimes I see questions like these:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4282/what-anime-is-this-winking-girl-from/4283#4283What anime is this winking girl from?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8322/what-anime-is-this-male-character-with-brown-hair-and-pierced-ears-from?rq=1What anime is this male character with brown hair and pierced ears from?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7512/anyone-know-what-anime-this-gif-is-from?rq=1Anyone know what anime this gif is from?


... which you could easily solve with Google reverse image search. All these questions above get upvoted or answered.

Therefore I'm asking: Why some image search questions which could easily be solved with Google gets upvoted, instead get downvoted like https://i.stack.imgur.com/9nKUZ.jpgthis one. Both are the same kind of questions but get different votes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why some image search questions are upvoted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If someone sees an image they also want to know the origin of, they may upvote it regardless of how easy it is to find.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In addition to the other reasons here, it's important to note that, at least early in the site's history, the frequency of image-based identification questions was low enough that many of the regulars didn't know or care that such questions could be answered easily via reverse image search. While that is common knowledge now, it's only because the number of such questions increased drastically, and so [a meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/793/) was made, which is now prominently displayed when an asker uses [tag:identification-request].


















The https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4282/what-anime-is-this-winking-girl-from/4283#42830first and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8322/what-anime-is-this-male-character-with-brown-hair-and-pierced-ears-from?rq=1second are indeed lazy questions. However, people from other sites who are unaware of the reverse image search feature will upvote them when the question gets featured on the hot network questions list. Same for new users who are unaware of reverse image search feature.

For the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7512/anyone-know-what-anime-this-gif-is-from?rq=1third question, just specify the image in reverse image search doesn't give any usable result, and it's probably necessary to do reverse image search on some frame in to get the desired result.

(I'm assuming only Google Reverse Image Search, since it is the only thing featured in the warning. General users don't read and search meta before asking question.)

There are only a handful of users who are aware of the feature and bother to vote on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions, so if the question gets exposed to new users and users from other sites of the network, it will get their upvotes.

The next vote also depends on the current score (upvotes + downvotes) of the question, due to the mob mentality. This may explain the case with the image you cited at the end.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The third question I also easily could find with Googleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Andruseto: Really? When I reverse search with Google, I can only find a bunch of image sites, and not tagged with the series name. If it is not clearly on first page, it can be considered somewhat hard to find.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://xxalex-your-godxx.deviantart.com/art/HOMESTUCK-GIF-6-326513321 Search on this site for the title of this anime: "Nabari no Ou". The user "thesumnang" leave there a comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is that the users are'nt smart and patient enought to search deeper. The reward for thier lazieness are votes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Andruseto: We want some minimal effort from user to do reverse image search. As long as the search result is not clear, it makes a valid question. The website you cited appears on the 3rd page in my search, so it is rather inaccessible, in my opinion. I would usually stop at the first page anyway.


















Images should not be the main part of the question. If all you can do is ask your question with an image to begin with, it's not a good question (Yes, that refers to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions as well).

If your question consists of one line with an image, it should probably be closed anyway.

What's the solution? Write more. The image should only be an added value, not the main thing.

If imgur drops dead tomorrow, your post should still stand, even if it doesn't look as pretty. 



TL;DR - I don't think there's anything that needs doing on that part. We just need better written questions, regardless of the images in it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't understand what else an asker can add to a question when what they have is only an image. Sometimes, the image comes from some image site without context, so it's the only thing the asker has. It's not a good question, but nothing can be improved about it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh TBH a question with less details is still a weaker question. If someone wants to ask "What character/item/thing is in this picture that I randomly found", then that makes for a very uneventful question that is likely no help to anyone but the person asking the question. All-in-all a rather bad question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If imgur drops dead tomorrow, Stack Exchange still has backups of the images stored on their account, according to http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/124988/. While they'd need to find a new place to host them, it's pretty safe to say that this would happen relatively quickly. So to me, it makes more sense to view images uploaded to Stack Exchange's imgur as permanent parts of the post on the same level as the text, rather than as bonus content that could disappear at any time the same way links could.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Thebluefish: I think it would help people who find the image via reverse image search, great question or not. (I don't think they are great question, but they are the best they can ever be, since nothing can possibly be added to make them better). Though for animated gif's case, I don't know if it helps that much.

With just 45 minutes of running time (40 if you don't count the end credits) and with such a simple plot, it's hard to put a synopsis without spoiler info, so I suggest you just read the tags, but here it is:


   The story of Hotarubi no Mori e centers around Hotaru, a little girl who gets lost in an enchanted forest where apparitions reside. A young boy, Gin, appears before Hotaru, but she cannot touch him for fear of making him disappear.


From the first 5 or so minutes, we could already deduce how the story is going to play out (given that you have read the tags). The hackneyed plot, however, is only a strength of this movie because of how well it is executed. The movie benefits from a tight plot, artfully segueing from the present journey to the past ones and back, and only focuses on a single element in a scene. It has comical moments, times of peacefulness and happiness, as well as blinks of trailing sadness, all the emotions one experiences when in love, and in the right proportions, too.

There is some incredible character development in this short span of screen time. We see Hotaru grow from a kid to a girl, and then to a young woman-to-be. With the passing of each season, Hotaru's feelings for Gin also budded, grew and developed increasingly. The movie captured the thoughts of an innocent girl in her stages of development so well, and the fact that the Hotaru at her different ages are superbly voiced by the same CV, SAKURA Ayane, is just the icing on the cake. Gin also received some character development, albeit in a much more subtle manner.

The music, while not particularly memorable, is so simple and good it can't get any better. The western musical instruments, especially the piano, are surprisingly more fitting with the Japanese and Shinto settings than the eastern musical instruments would be.

The animation is decent, not breath-taking for its era and type, but that just goes to show that the story and the vibes are more important than animation quality. In fact, I would argue that most of the time, photo-realistic animation is just wasted money and actually hampers the presentation of the spiritual stuff and/or central messages (sorry, Shinkai Makoto fans, but 5 Centimeters Per Second might be an exception). The anime is done by the same team behind Natsume's Book of Friends, so there are similarities between them.

Despite the ample premonitions throughout the anime of the inevitable, this panda who has withstood tears to watch many anime still cried like a dog upon the second watch. It's like snow melting in your hand: it aches a little from the cold, but the warmth that comes afterwards is worth it. My advice on how to enjoy this movie fully (as with any anime IMO): watch it in HD when you can be by yourself at a quiet place and when you are not emotionally high or low.



Slice of life. Romance. Supernatural.

For me, the poster was enough, and like I said, I might be hyping it too much. But seeing that you liked *Aria* and *Clannad*, I think you'll enjoy this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I definitely liked the poster, but your eloquent words told me that it was more than just an artbook on film, and that made a difference. Recently I've watched a whole parade of shows that had amazing posters and utterly disappointing writing. And yes, my love for *Aria* and *Clannad* is obsessive and undying.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda I share your feelings. I recently watched another Makoto Shinkai film [*The Garden of Words*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/Kotonoha_no_Niwa), but I don't think there is anything more to it than is already in the PV: amazing posters, period. *Aria* the manga is one of the few that has both superb artwork and writing. [New *Aria* anime is coming out!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29893/)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New Aria anime...it's like someone is trying to remind me that good things still exist in this rotten world.


















I use Firefox and Chrome mainly . When there is a link provided in the comment/answer/question , the link redirects to a page from the existing tab rather than opening a new tab & displaying it there.

for eg: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A67ZkAd1wmILeft Click here . By default , the site appears in this same tab and not in a new tab.

The same problem exists when it comes to the mobile site.

I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with it but why can't the links be opened in a new tab automatically rather than having to do it manually?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why aren't links opened in new pages?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, usually i want to open in-question links in a new tab, rather than switch. I'm pretty used to ctrl+clicking though, so I never really registered itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Use middle button (click on wheel). Problem solved. I never left-click on link if I want to open it in new tab.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5nhahtdh, you're an experienced user. I'm talking in general. And btw I use my laptop's touchpad mouse. There's no wheel on it . @ToshinouKyouko since Im a noob here , I keep forgetting that the links don't open in a new page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyway, it might be a problem for mobile users. It's more convenient for them to tap, than to tap-hold-select-new-tab-option to open in new tab. I think you might want to post the request on Meta.SE, since this is a network-wide issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can't migrate it? :P @GaoWeiwei I know , but thanks :) . It's kinda hard on mobile too. I still feel click-for-new-page is easier in generalb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EroSennin: Just ask a new question. It's faster (and doesn't harm) in this case, I think. Try to incorporate the discussion over here into your request.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh .. similar cases : http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/35677/have-all-links-open-in-a-new-tab http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2275/make-links-posted-by-users-open-in-a-new-windowb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GaoWeiwei the guys on the SE meta are suggesting to use Ctrl+Click and MMB . Should I change my question to specify the new tab issue in phones ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EroSennin I think they will tell you to install the SE App, which does open all links in your default browser (behaves like opening a new window), but you could try.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GaoWeiwei But SE App is not valid for every single internet-using phone right ? Plus this entire matter isn't about just one user.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EroSennin The pros do not outweigh the cons, so I doubt they would cater to the ever-decreasing niche market of non-Android phones or non-iphones. It's still relatively easy to press and hold to open a new tab, or open in the same tab and pressing the back button. But as I said, you could try asking on Meta.SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm .. point noted. But there are slow internet and other issues which make the above methods *kinda* tough. Nothing major. Will ask meta later :P @GaoWeiwei

http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/gankutsuou-the-count-of-monte-cristoGankutsuou [Anime]

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gankutsuougankutsuou



Loosely based on the story of The Count of Monte Cristo, Gankutsuou is a feast for the eyes. It blends traditional animation with elaborate textures, uses appropiate usage of 3d animation and is distinctly different in style to most other anime. I recommend watching this purely for the visual feast, but the story is very good aswell.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gankutsuou:_The_Count_of_Monte_CristoBelow Synopsis from Wikipedia:

The story takes place in the far future of the 51st Century, during the year 5053.

While visiting Luna for the festival, Viscount Albert de Morcerf and Baron Franz d'Épinay make the acquaintance of the Count of Monte Cristo, a self-made nobleman. When they part, the Count promises to visit Albert in Paris. After he arrives, he introduces himself to the most powerful families in France (the Morcerfs, the Danglars, and the Villeforts).

The general plot of Gankutsuou, while broadly the same as the novel on which it is based, changes many aspects of the source material. In the novel, the narrative arc follows the Count chronologically; in the anime, the story begins with Albert and Franz meeting the Count on Luna (which occurs, in Rome, many hundreds of pages into the book), and the Count's back story is pieced together throughout the series. The anime's plot includes futuristic elements, talking about space travel, computer systems and robots, different fates for some characters, the disposal of several side-plots, and an altogether different ending.

Furthermore, the fact that another [answer is accepted](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/accepted-answer), doesn't mean it is better than yours, just that the OP feels that one addresses his question better. [Votes](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/why-vote) determine the acceptance of the answer by the community. Also, the other answer refers to a movie in the Naruto universe, whereas yours doesn't.

Do nothing. Stack Exchange sites are designed to have questions with multiple answers, with the best getting voted to the top.

Don't worry about it.

You are right that the message is wrong. It should say "question" instead of "answer". You should put this bug report up on Meta.SE.

As for the warning itself, meta questions must have one of the tags /questions/tagged/discussiondiscussion, /questions/tagged/bugbug, /questions/tagged/feature-requestfeature-request, /questions/tagged/supportsupport, so it's by design.

When discussing about an answer before posting it, commenting is essential. We can add spoilers in questions and answers


   like this


but not in comments. Anyone who reads the comments can see the spoilers. Why can't we add spoiler tags to comments?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Spoilers in commentsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5>! example, where this shoulda had been a spoiler.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this was already discussed lots of times on stackexchange and we still don't have this feature, so I assume it's widely regarded as unnecessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On SFF.SE they seem to do a lot of "blah blah happened because of what's in your second spoiler block", referring back to the question.


















This is a bit of a complicated matter to address. If you can provide a specific use case where the use of spoilers would be beneficial in the long term, such a request could be better prioritized.

While the subject of spoilers, their nature, how to avoid them, and how to use them has been the subject of numerous feuds debates, one thing is for certain:

Each and everyone of us, as individuals, has different opinion and tolerance to spoilers. 

I myself enjoy them. My reasoning is that, if I know how something ends/happens, I don't need to worry about the conclusion and can focus more on the events in between. I know many people would disagree, but the act of the matter is that dealing with spoilers is more so a matter of netiquette than necessity.

No one can really agree on how long a spoiler stays a spoiler, nor can we force them to agree. Common netiquette dictates that unless the OP specifies otherwise, spoilers aren't welcome. Spoilers tag are more of a band-aid of sorts to mediate the situation.

If you have a tolerance to spoilers so little that you don't want to know anything about the future plot points, you'll have little choice but to avoid the entire Internet and other people until you're up-to-date. 

On the surface, someone concerned about spoilers simply has to view/read new episode/chapter/volume the moment they're available. The act of the matter is that we live on a global scale, thanks in part to the Internet. Due to the circumstances and bottlenecks (personal or otherwise), we can't all enjoy everything simultaneously. With anime and manga, Japan as a distinct and lasting advantage, due to factors out of the control for most people, such as localization and distribution. With that in mind, spoilers are an inevitable part of the everyday -- if you're a year behind on a series, it is almost unavoidable that you'll encounter at least minor spoilers for anything popular. 

As a Q&A site, spoilers are unavoidable if one desires a complete answer. But realize that not everyone everywhere has access to the same channels. On the various StackExchange sites, there are multitudes of users of different experience levels, from countries of varying social climates and statuses. Some might be better off than others, while others might not. It's best to take netiquette into account when posting about spoilers. 

Sure spoiler tags are nice to have, both in the body and in the comments. Are they absolutely necessary? I don't think so. 

There are times where it's alright to post spoilers. For an example, if the title implies (w/o spoilers, or saying "(spoiler) in the title"), that there will be spoilers (how does X obtain Y)

Just as you should avoid spoilers in the question title, by reasons of netiquette to fellow users, you should avoid writing so on the comments as well. 

Why not the in the comments you ask? I feel that mentioning spoilers could facilitate unnecessary discussion chains. Unlike sites like Reddit and YouTube, whose content and usage revolve largely around the body of content and peoples reactions, we're less so a forum, so extended discussions via the comment are a bit counter-productive. We have http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-our chatroom for that. If you have something significant you want to point out (i.e. details are off or out of context), post an answer addressing just that. If you want to have further discussion on the subject, http://chat.stackexchange.com/use chat.

In conclusion, I believe that having spoiler tag in the comments is not very conducive to the purpose of our site. We are after all not a forum, but a Q&A site. We ask questions to get answers. Everything has its place, discussions about our site policy is be done in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/our meta (or https://meta.stackexchange.com/Meta.SE for StackExchange commnity-wide policies). If an answer is wrong or inaccurate, you can inform the answerer of the discrepancy and downvote the answer to let others know, but at the same time, provide a source of reference to back up you point.

I've seen a few posts where the person asking/answering are not able to express his/her thoughts because of poor english. At such times the person's question is put on hold and the person is asked to make changes or improve their question/answer. The most recent case being this one  https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/19497/revisionshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/19497/revisions .

Instead of asking the person to improve their own posts using english , why not suggest the option of posting the details in their native language? We can get the basic details and understand(most of it) via a translator. Then all thats left to do is to put the translated details into the original post. Is this feasible ? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What to do about questions/answers that are unclear due to poor English?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The case you use as an example was actually a case in which the OP showed very little effort, saying that he ["didn't want to keep on editing his question"](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19497/#comment26112_19497), as if he were doing us a favour. It's good to keep in mind that though we are here to help new users, they should also show some effort in salvaging their own questions. In that case, isn't it easier for the OP to use a translator herself, instead of us doing it? We can always edit the details, as long as the general point of the question is understood.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5last part,they use native language and we translate it. The translated part may be completely different from what OP want to say. As we don't know what OP want to say ,we see translated part as the main and the response may deviate a lot. So as JNat says,OP should use translator.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ohh okay understood. Silly of me to ask a question where the answer was obvious :p sorry


















If the question is understandable, then we will help the user as much as we can to fix the post into something presentable. However, if the user's English is too poor that you can't understand what the question is trying to ask, our site is probably not the place for such user.

In the case above, it wasted quite a lot of time and effort from several experienced users and (I think) it also annoyed the OP quite a bit with all the exchanges in the comment. While the end result is a somewhat OK question, it is quite counter-productive in my opinion.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, in every aspect.


















The rules
If you create a tag for a Studio Ghibli anime (see the list below) by asking a question with that tag, I will award you a 50-reputation bounty, provided that:

The question is posted during the month of March 2015.
The question receives a net score of at least +1 by April 7, 2015, and isn't closed or deleted. (We want good questions, not bad ones.) Note: The February contest initially required a score of +3; this has been changed to +1
You have posted at least one answer on the site with a score of at least 0. (Bounties can only be awarded to answers, not questions.)
You have less than 10,000 reputation at the time of this posting. (This excludes Krazer / Jon Lin / Logan / Eric / Madara / kuwaly: no sense in making the rich richer.)

If you do not have https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsenough reputation to create a tag (150 rep), that's fine - post the question anyway with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag and mention that you need somebody with more reputation to create the tag, and somebody will surely take care of that for you. I will give you (rather than the higher-rep user who physically creates the tag) credit for creating the tag.
There is no limit on the number of bounties you can win (other than that you obviously can't win more bounties than there are tags to be made). Note: This is a change from Feb 2015
If someone creates a tag but is disqualified from receiving a bounty for any of the reasons above, the bounty may still be awarded to the next user who asked a question in that tag, unless they are disqualified for some reason, in which case I'll go on to the next user, and so forth. So, if somebody "beats you to the punch", but they already have >10k rep, go ahead and post your question! Who knows - you could well win the bounty.
These rules are subject to revision by me at any time and for any reason. (But I probably won't unless I seriously overlooked something important.)

I was reading what type of questions are allowed and it said clearly:


  you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”


are not really allowed/encouraged. However, I wasn't quite sure if that meant every "hypothetical question" is disallowed. What if there is an answer to the question that has very high probability of being correct? What if even though it never happened in the anime, the question probably has an answered that could be backed up with detail events that happened from the anime?

The question I was thinking was:


  If Pain got in a battle with Hashirama Senju, who would end victorious?


It is true that the question is (unfortunately) hypothetical since these two never had the please to fight. However, one could infer which one would win from different events in the show. For example, pain already fought two users of sage mode (jiraya and naruto), so there are things we could infer about who would be successful. Furthermore, Hashirama did battle madara with the rinnengan and we know the result of the battle, so we can infer further things. Etc, so it could lead to very interesting answer leading to better understanding of both characters fighting style.

Anyway, is that question allowed? Are all hypothetical questions plainly banned? What if they have potential to having very well backup reasoning from the show?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are question that are slightly hypothetical, but with potentially great answers dissallowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I were to give example of hypothetical questions, a lot of hypothetical questions are made for the Death Note series, but they are kinda answerable since there is a clear list of rules from the series itself. For stuffs like what if we change the plot at certain point, or how strong the characters are against each other, they are kind of opinion-based and prone to attract low quality answer, especially when the characters are more or less as powerful but never got a chance to fight with each other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think something like this *could* be okay if the question is structured properly. You have to set out a defined list of criteria that would classify a victory. Something like "Is Pain's chakra stronger than Hashirama Senju's?" would be more acceptable because that distinctly ties it to facts in the canon. The reason for this being that we cannot predict how the outcome of a battle would go; that's what the plot dictates.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Concur with nhahtdh - hypothetical questions about a show are fine **if the show has a coherent framework of rules from which we can make deductions**. That said, shows like this are few and far between, and I can't really think of any other than Death Note off the top of my head.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, here's another example - for the most part, the way Geasses work in Code Geass is fairly well-defined (though not to the same extent as Death Note), so we can often ask questions like "what would happen if Lelouch ordered X to do Y but then Z happened". I think we do have a few questions like this on the site. On the other hand, "battle anime" are generally not well-suited to this, because the whole point of those shows is often that when A beats B, it's because A revealed a hitherto-hidden technique, or used the power of friendship, or went through a training montage.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I mostly agree with Senshin's answer below. I just think I should add that IMO questions like your example (Pain vs Hashirama) are not ok. Unless the hypothesis one delivers can be based solely on power or something similar - "A is evidently stronger than B, so A would win" - (which doesn't seem to be the case, as you cannot define in clear terms "stronger"), you cannot base your answer on previous fights and still have an answer that is not completely open-ended and hypothetical. "A beat B, and B beat C, so obviously A beats C" does not always (or in most cases it doesn't, probably) check.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In general I dislike "Who could beat who?" questions on this site. As Logan M. mentions below, it's too "Gorilla vs Shark". I dislike them even if you're confining it to a single universe.


















I don't think they should be disallowed. If you can base the answer with solid arguments, drawn from canon or from logic and sound application of scientific knowledge, it is ok.

If we were to disallow these kinds of questions, several great questions and answers would just vanish. This SE site is an entertainment site, so we can affort to be a little more lax on the subjective side than other sister sites, like SO.

So without any attempt of laying ground rules, I will list some examples of when I think its ok:


If the canon can support the argumentation for the answer, it is valid (like a Death Note rules what-if)
If it can be answered using real-world physics or other scientific knowledge, but outside canon, it is valid. Ex: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/how-is-misakas-railgun-so-destructive?s=1|1.0961How is Misaka's railgun so destructive?


The question need to set the ground for an answer that is verifiable; i.e. in the case of an hipothetical battle, even the fans of the defeated party would agree that he would be defeated in those conditions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure about your second point. As mentioned in a comment by the OP of your referred question, mixing anime and physics might not be the best thing to do. While the answers seem to be *very* satisfiable, such questions might be better of on the physics SE.


















Okay, hold up.
As I commented on the question, I think that hypotheticals within a single universe are fine in some cases - namely, when the universe has its own internal logic that is reasonably coherent. Death Note is a stellar example of this, and there are surely other franchises that work reasonably well.
Similarly, questions that ask about real-world justifications for some anime thing are generally okay (a la https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/How is Misaka's railgun so destructive?), since even if the anime's rules are wishy-washy, the real world obeys very clearly-defined laws, so we only have one source of uncertainty here. Granted, sometimes the answer is "this thing that happens in anime X is completely incompatible with the way the real world works because Y", but that's fine.
However, I don't think that hypotheticals that involve multiple universes - like Mindwin's question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19778/https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19778/ - are ever okay. Both Mahouka and Code Geass have fairly coherent internal logic (for magic and geasses, respectively), and so I think that hypotheticals within either universe would generally be okay.
But when you mix them? Oh my god that's a horrible can of worms. Here's why:

We now have two sources of uncertainty, whereas in the within-one-universe and universe-vs-real-world cases, we only have one. This makes it drastically more difficult to consider how the rules of the two universes should interact. What exactly does it even mean for Geass to use psions to work? What is a Code in the context of the Mahouka universe's magic framework? Does the concept of "immunity" to passive Geass powers like C.C.'s even make sense?
Any universe-mixing question is going to have any number of points of uncertainty like this, and there's no obvious way to resolve them. After all, there's no a priori reason to expect the fictional laws underlying the two universes to be compatible.

This opens the door to "Can Flash beat Accelerator?" and "Can Goku beat Superman?" questions, which we absolutely do not want. (Right? This isn't a controversial point of view, is it?)

Tangentially, what value do these questions give? I'm not of the opinion that this site should be entirely about "problems you want to solve" like SO/etc are - amusing diversions are fine - but even so, this type of question still seems too far removed from the realm of useful questions.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, [Gorilla vs. Shark](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/) is one of the major types of questions SE is intended to avoid. Somewhat hypothetical in-universe questions should be okay if they're still focused on better understanding some aspect of the story or setting, but if it gets to the point of out-of-universe comparisons or crossovers we're pretty solidly in the realm of useless speculation.


















Let's get rid of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fillersfillers tag? It's not like there are "anime filler specialists" going around answering those.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nobody likes fillersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I strongly concur.


















It pretty much comes down to whether it's good filler or bad filler. Good filler being filler that expands on the story without contradiction. Bad filler is filler that is either pointless or contradictory or simply exists to pad out an episode's length.

In a manga to manga example. The One Punch Man re-draw has new scenes added to existing material and new side stories that weren't in the original web-comic, however all the changes were ok'd/written by the original Author and simply enhance the series as a whole. That's good filler. (Some could even argue...to a point...that Bleach's filler was ok.....since they at least did try to reference those events by adding new scenes to existing later material and explain why everyone was weaker during the filler arc then the previous one, though they did sometimes come off as very out of place, and some fillers were just simple time-wasters)

Bad filler imo is filler like in several episodes of Dragon Ball, where things happen that are never referenced again nor do they change anything involving the plot. They're simply there to pad out run-time. Because they tend to be quickly thrown together they often can even introduce contradictions to the story.

The worst sort of filler however, is filler that is put in at the EXPENSE of canon material. A recent example being Tokyo Ghoul Season 1, which devoted nearly 3 episodes of runtime (out of 12) to exploring a character that died in the manga before the story even began and not only contradicted the source material in several places, a VERY important scene was removed to fit it in. TG's first season would've barely fit into 12 episodes where they planned to end it, but it could have been done properly with only minor trimming of events. Instead they sacrificed actual development of canonical characters to literally waste time building up a character for no reason (some would argue that it's to give more impact and feels, but since that character ALREADY had plenty of feels it won't make you feel anymore for them and was simply wasted time, and as a result important information on how ghouls' bodies work and fight were cut out completely, not to mention lots of scenes that showed character development for the important characters resulting in the occasionally pulling something out of their %^$ without explanation since those scenes were cut).



I do feel it's an important question over all, as some filler really is a waste of time to watch/read, while some filler is worth watching/reading and it's good to be able to tell people that to clarify, since Filler as a blanket term is generally seen as a negative because most filler is bad filler. But some older mangas might use a newer anime to add filler to enhance their story/correct somethings they changed their minds about and be canon, but since most people consider things that contradict the source material to be filler, it receives a negative opinion unless the people are just really vocal about how much it improved the work.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I doubt it's a matter of quality.  If a person decides that they only want to stick to the canonical episodes, then it doesn't matter how good the filler was - they're not going to want to include it in their viewing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It technically does. If I'm a manga reader, and watching an anime of a manga I like, then I want to see the anime at LEAST as good as the manga. If new information is added to expand and enhance the work via new scenes or even new episodes without detracting from it, then I'm all for it, and a lot of others do feel the same. But the problem is...filler is generally crap and merely padding without substance, and no one wants to watch padding/crap.

A highly caffeinated show full of low-brow slapstick and visual reference to all sorts of anime. I got pretty burnt out on it after about seven episodes, but Episode 4, which parodies renai games, is still pretty funny.

Similar to Excel Saga, it picks a new genre to parody every episode and does so with lots of slapstick, low-brow, zany, over-caffeinated humor, but also has a main plot that's weirdly Studio Ghibli-like, with a touching coming-of-age story and one of those trademark Gainax endings.

I believe all three can be answered definitively (most likely with very similar answers).

Heck, I think there should only be a single question about this topic left open. The arguments are essentially the same, so there is no need to rehash the same content all over again.

Due to the ambiguous nature of the subject matter, the 3 question cited are likely to illicit answers to "rebut" the existing answers, while there is actually nothing to rebut, since both views are essentially valid in certain perspective.

How is the person supposed to post a good https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question if they can't see the general guidelines? 

At present, the box is like a green-signal for low-content https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions. 
The Provide details. Share your research. just encourages them to post whatever they have, regardless of the quality of the content.

With the box containing better instructions and a more eye-catching color, the user wouldn't have a problem noticing it and it can also save us time and effort. 

Can the existing box be tweaked to contain the general criteria link as well as other useful links?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can the "How to Ask" be updated to include better guidelines?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "How to Ask" sidebox isn't editable (without looping in the community team, anyway) as far as I know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin wouldn't the community team consider doing it ? It looks dull. Seriouslyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe? But the "How To Ask" box looks the same on pretty much all Stack Exchange sites, so maybe not? More to the point, I rather doubt that people actually pay much attention to that box anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5People pay less attention to it because of its current appearance? In other words, there isn't anything about that box that would make people go through it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, it's more that there's nothing _forcing_ people to read the box. If you add more text to the box, people are even _less_ likely to read it, I would imagine. I mean, sure, some people will glance at it and maybe pay attention to it, but most people will just skip past it, and get straight to writing their question, no matter what we put in the box.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, I'm not asking to add more details. Editing the present details could be feasible (if they consider doing it). Simple links can replace the existing lines. Its better than posting the guidelines link as comment. As for your last line, then what is the purpose of the box? We know that most people wont/dont go through it, then why do we still keep the box ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess we keep the box because we have empty space next to the question-editor and we may as well put something there? (i.e. if even one person asks a better question after reading the box, it's worth having.) If you're suggesting replacing the existing contents of the box with something of about the same length that you think will be more useful, I think that could be a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah I'm suggesting that :) Let's see what the others have to sayb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't say much, yes, but it says enough for a smart person to understand there are rules. The two links for help center and asking help say that there exist detailed guidelines. Nice users would follow these links and figure out how to properly ask, but remember that this is the minority of cases. New users usually come from much simpler places like Yahoo answers, which don't have any strict rules or guidelines. We have comments and close reasons in case the user expects us to be the same, and the two links in this small box for cooler users :pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lol @Hakase, well put. But I still think id-req guideline, if added, can help us and them. Majority of the questions we receive are id-reqs and majority of that ends up getting closed due to poor content. The link in the box can say **Are you trying to identify an anime or manga? Then click here** . The bold font might catch the users' eye and by not revealing that the link leads to a guideline, increases the chance of the user seeing the guideline. But anyways, +1 to your points :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually I proposed the exact same thing recently, but didn't get to post a feature request because I thought that it would clutter the site design and be largely useless for all users who are not asking for ID requests. And the comments along with close messages nicely play the role of "warning boxes", along with linking to the help info. Just because some users are having trouble asking specific kinds of questions, I don't think putting a notification visible to everyone is the right decision. But that's just my opinion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Yeah. I've thought about that too. It *is* kinda unthoughtful but I thought since our stack is approaching graduation (I think), a new box exclusive to A&M SE wouldn't be much of a bother.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A lot of users don't even bother to improve their posts even after they're given all the links. In my opinion, we should enforce our rules more strictly and close obviously bad requests, so users will see that they will not get any answers unless they improve. Otherwise it's wasting space on our site and not being useful to anyone. And requests closed for too long should be removed. I think this will be effective enough measure to teach users to post better ID requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. @Hakase maybe you should try a meta post on the deletion part.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase: Requests closed for too long, which has 0 score or less, will be removed automatically eventually.


















We are currently working on assuring that the image-identification policies on this site are addressing the site's best interests. They are a big deal for this site, considering that not only does meta have a tag called /questions/tagged/identification-questionsidentification-questions, but they also take up 24% of all questions on the main site.

Mostly, though, there are two kinds of identification requests. There are memory-based description requests and image-based requests. While both situations and policies need addressing, I'd first like us to iron out image-based requests.

First, let it be clear that I am talking about identifying an anime or manga from one or more images. Some questions, while tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, are not identifying anime or manga, but rather elements of a series. (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4239/274This question is one example.)

So, here are some examples of questions that this post is addressing.


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20483/274https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20483/274
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20475/274https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20475/274
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20454/274https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20454/274


What I'd like to do is determine the community's opinion on the feasibility of these questions and what action should be taken on them. Specifically, should we leave them open and up to voters, or should we have a policy that allows us to close them?

Some pros and cons I've considered are:


Pro: They are generally easy to answer and show more detail than is easily described.
Pro: They do not really harm the site in any way. (As addressed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1040/274here.)
Con: We frequently get requests that can be easily found via Google Reverse Image Search (or TinEye, or SauceNao, etc.).
Con: They are completely SEO-unfriendly; that is, no one can benefit from them by searching Google, even if they are looking for the same image's source.
Con: We are frequently asked about the source of images which are fan art or completely original characters. (Or vocaloid mascots.)
Con: The size and quality of these images is frequently questionable, at best.
Con: (Related to above) They are frequently avatars that are cropped to the point where the character in them could be one of many, especially if it's fan art.


What do you guys think of these questions? Are you in favor of keeping them? Are you in favor of closing them? Are you in favor of adding requirements to them, in addition to posting the image?

Note: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1034/274This question addresses the same issue, but is about 9 months old and looks at it from a different point of view.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should become of image-only identification requests?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"They are generally easy to answer and show more detail than is easily described." - ease of answering is debatable, and ease of description should be irrelevant in my opinion


















As the writer of the previous meta topic, I'll pitch in.
There are three types of image-only questions that I've identified:
No-Research
These questions are simply a matter of doing reverse image-searching. These should be downvoted for lack of research effort under the current rules. We have several measures in place for this already, unfortunately not everyone does the Tour.
Images the Community recognises
Nice - a community member can post the answer.
Images the Community doesn't recognise
There's not much content to go on. We can search attributes of the image 'red haired maid anime' , 'red hair maid outfit anime', etc. These don't lend themselves easy to further research.
Proposal
I believe we need to have a standard for images questions that requires information about the 'lost' media besides the image.
In doing so, we achieve several things:

Questions are easier to answer (More information, more likely we can find it)
Questions are of higher quality (Questioners have a better idea of the media they are looking for and will be more likely to provide id confirmations, or more details upon questioning)
Answers are more likely to be accepted (See previous point)
Reduced fan-art images (Most fan art does not have plot or other elements behind it)

What should that standard be?
Preferably, we can come to a community consensus on this, but here's an example of what it could look like:

Image Requests also fall under the '3 pieces of information' rule that apply to non-image requests currently
Images must feature a character, landmark or other recognisable item in the given image
Images must be sufficiently large to make out the details on these previously mentioned features

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm propose setting a hard *requirement* stating if you (the asker) have not, at the very least attempted, to do a reverse image search and the answer comes up in such a search (in an obvious manner [tbd]), then your question will be flagged/voted for deletion. If you did not at least make an attempt to find if yourself, then why should we bother take the effort and be an enabler to your laziness.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, but badly researched questions are down voted under current stack exchange policyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Reduced fan-art images* - Notably, Google reverse image searching for fan art will almost always result in finding the image (as long as the artist hasn't taken it down).


















The rules

If you create a tag for a sports anime (see the list below) that aired in 2005 or later, I will award you a 50-reputation bounty 100-reputation bounty (With help from Madara Uchiha), provided that: 


The question is posted during the month of April 2015.
The question receives a net score of at least +1 by May 7, 2015, and isn't closed or deleted. (We want good questions, not bad ones.) 
You have posted at least one answer on the site with a score of at least 0. (Bounties can only be awarded to answers, not questions.)
You have less than 15,000 reputation at the time of this posting. (This excludes Krazer / Jon Lin / Logan / Eric: users with 15k rep will have almost all privileges even after the site graduates.) This is a change from the March 2015 contest, where the cutoff was 10,000 reputation.


If you do not have https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsenough reputation to create a tag (150 rep), that's fine - post the question anyway with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag, and somebody will come by and make a tag for you. I will give you (rather than the higher-rep user who physically creates the tag) credit for creating the tag.

There is no limit on the number of bounties you can win (other than that you obviously can't win more bounties than there are tags to be made).

I'm sure this list isn't exhaustive. If you want bounty credit for a sports anime from 2005 onwards that I haven't listed here, just leave a comment on this post and I'll have a look at it. I am willing to be fairly open with regard to what counts as a "sports" anime.

Since March is over and all bounty-eligible questions have a score of +1 or better right now, this iteration of the bounties-for-tags program is over. The following tags were created:

Lastly - the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2305/April 2015 bounties-for-tags program is now open. The theme: sports anime.

Eric's post a few days ago about identification requests contains a problematic paragraph:


  First, let it be clear that I am talking about identifying an anime or manga from one or more images. Some questions, while tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, are not identifying anime or manga, but rather elements of a series. (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4239/274This question is one example.)


The fact that Eric has to specify that he is talking about one kind of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question but not the other kind of identification-request question strongly suggests that we are using the tag to refer to too many different kinds of things. 

Let's take a look at the tag wiki excerpt: 


  For questions which ask about the identification of an anime/manga/character using a description; specific elements (like a character or song); or screenshots.


There are two entirely different types of questions here. First, we have questions in which the user does not know the name of the anime/manga/franchise they are looking for. This is the "conventional" sort of identification request, and I think it is uncontroversial that we should tag them with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request.

But on the other hand, this tag is also being used for questions where the user knows what franchise they're in and seeks to identify a "specific element". For example:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20286/1908What is the song from Naruto Shippuden episode 48 - Bonds at 3:10?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20217/1908What's the name of the music played during the final battle of Tokyo Ghoul √A episode 9?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/19464/1908Who is the general depicted in the ending of Oda Nobuna no Yabou?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/19239/1908Who is the character sporting a mohican whom Onizuka is parodying?


I see why people are tagging these questions with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request - the asker wants something "identified", right? But this is a dangerous line of thinking. Should we tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20229/1908Is Nadia voluntarily inspired by Castle in the Sky? with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request because the asker wants to "identify" the connection between Nadia and Castle in the Sky? What about https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20561/1908The Kamisama Hajimemashita anime covers the manga up to what chapter? - doesn't the asker want to "identify" the chapter at which the anime ends? No, of course we shouldn't. 

This latter type of question is a completely different beast than the "conventional" identification request. Indeed, they even require different skillsets to answer - to answer a "conventional" identification request, you need to be good at Googling and mind-reading. Whereas, to answer a question like https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/18615/1908What is the context of this reference to Chrollo Lucilfer in Inou Battle manga chapter 1?, you need to know things about Hunter x Hunter and Inou Battle. 

As such, I move to amend the tag wiki excerpt for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request to read something like this:


  For questions in which you want to find the name of an anime, manga, or other work based on screenshots/recollections/etc.


Then, we ought to remove https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request from all the places where it's inappropriately used (probably somewhere over half of these: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/295881http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/295881). 



Here is another example: https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21027/1908Who is the creator of the manga Yu Yu Hakusho?. It was not tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request. But it asks for the author (a tangible entity) to be identified. Should we tag this with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request? If one wishes to be consistent with the tagging decisions I describe above, I would think so. (For the purposes of this discussion, ignore the fact that the question sucks.)



tl;dr Let's stop using https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request on things that aren't "conventional" identification requests.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We shouldn't use [identification-request] on questions that aren't really identification requestsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I mostly expect [identification-request] to be used on questions that identify tangible things (whether in-universe or out-of-universe). An anime, manga, or sound track is tangible, as is a specific character within a series. This was [touched upon in an earlier meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/545/274).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア Okay, sure, that's how we've been doing it, but why? What value do we get by tagging questions like "what is this song from this show called?" with [identification-request]? From the perspective of "tags should help experts find questions they can answer", does it make sense to send the experts on googling and mindreading to answer questions on in-universe things?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, if we already know the work, there's no need for id-req to be on it. we get enough flak as it is for that tag, lets just keep it for id-ing works we don't know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin I tend to agree, though I feel like those questions need something. I don't think every expert in FMA knows the OST as well, for example, so keeping *just* that tag on there is perhaps undesirable. I think other sites use [*-identification] (where * is music, game, movie, etc.) but I don't think we can change that at this point. To me, a question asking for an OST track needs more than just [series][music].b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is also the case of identifying reference. Is it correct to assume that this meta post doesn't touch on this type of questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア My position seems to be the opposite of yours - I don't think we should even use [music] on questions like that (though I don't feel very strongly about this). Consider the consequences of this if we were to carry this through more thoroughly - should we use [plot] on questions about plot of FMA, or [characters] on questions about characters in FMA? If we do, we end up with a tagging scheme like at Movies.SE. Now, one thing that would work here, in my opinion, would be to tag questions with something like [fma][fma-music], just like on SO we would tag questions with, say, (...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(...) [android][android-resources], or whatever. The problem, of course, is that none of these "subsidiary" tags would have enough questions to be worthwhile on a site our size. But the current paradigm of [fma][music] is analogous to [android][resources], which is of course frowned upon on SO because people are typically not experts on "resources" but rather on resources in the context of a particular system/framework/etc. Expanding that to [fma][music][id-request] is like... I don't know, [android][resources][programming] or something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin That's part of what makes this so hard (our size, that is). Ideally we *would* have [fma-music] tags. But at the same time, I think it's rare that an expert solely in [fma] would be able to answer all OST questions, while some would be able to. I can see both sides of this, though, and the problem is that I'm not sure either one works perfectly.

As a general rule, we as a site don't allow for anime recommendation questions, and according to our https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askhelp page, we recommend avoiding questions that include "your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”"

However, recently, this question was asked: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20621/looking-for-manga-apps-which-filter-out-mature-contentLooking for manga apps which filter out mature content. The question is clearly asking for a list, which could potentially be too broad or just end up opening up questions about what counts as mature content, etc. 

On the other hand, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4696/what-databases-and-listing-sites-exist-for-anime-manga-etc?answertab=active#tab-topthis question exists, and it is also a list answer. However, it is clearly stated in the question that it exists to act as a canonical reference for the site, which isn't the case (from what I can tell) from the app question.

I just want to clarify: is the app-recommendation question on-topic/allowed, and if so, why?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this app-recommendation question on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think recommendation is on topic, but question about what legal apps exist should be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We don't do recommendation questions (What should I watch? kind of questions). However, questions asking for sites to watch/read anime/manga legally are OK, and definitely helpful for people other than the OP. There can only be less than a handful questions of this type, and in case it turns into a mess, the mess is contained and we can just clean it up easily.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh That makes sense, and it was basically what I assumed, but I mostly just wanted to confirm that.


















As some of you may have heard on chat, I had to forfeit being a mod here on Anime (https://i.stack.imgur.com/4lGzc.gifit was great fun while it lasted) because of my new position on Stack Exchange (http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/04/jnat-and-animuson-workin-on-ur-problemz/huzzah!).
Since we still don't have a prediction for when this site will be fully graduated and able to host its first elections, a replacement for the position I left open was in order.
I am pleased to announce that senshin has stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community’s issues are properly addressed, and to continue to help the site grow into a huge success.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/1908
Please welcome senshin for the hard work and time they contribute.
You can read about the Pro-Tem Moderator program here: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/Moderators Pro Tempore.
Did I overlook anyone?
Almost certainly. There are members who are actively involved and very deserving of recognition. My failure to account for everyone is in no way a slight against them. Ideally, Moderators are elected by the community and that's why there'll be elections once the site has graduated.
Most of all, be respectful and understanding of the Moderators Pro Tem. Members of your community are volunteering their time and learning on the job. It’s a learning experience for everyone.

As a new user to anime.stackexchange (and StackExchange in general) here is some feedback.


I can't tag one of my most recent questions as "07-ghost" because I don't have 150 reputation...
I can't comment on questions because I don't have 50 reputation... 
I found a question I was pretty sure I could answer (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20588/help-in-remembering-an-animeAnime about boy who can accelerate objects; also meets girl with wooden katana) but I can't answer it because you guys voted it "closed"
My attempts to edit it all get rejected because "This edit was intended to address the author of the post and makes no sense as an edit. It should have been written as a comment or an answer." (Fair enough, but editing the answer in is literally my only option.)
I don't even know if the above issues are because of StackExchange or this specific community...


I understand you probably want to avoid an Eternal September with the community but seriously, I feel like an unwelcome observer, not a participant. :\
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is this site so unwelcoming to new members?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5tl;dr for anyone who read this question. It's mostly due to the model of StackExchange (and the restrictions are there for a good reason). The other case is due to policy specific to Anime.SE to reduce bad id-req questions.


















Let me address each of your concerns in turn:


That is a known issue. But like most other limitations, it's there to prevent abuse. If any use would just be able to create any tag they wish, you'd have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naruto-shipudennaruto-shipuden, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naruto-shippudennaruto-shippuden, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naruto-shipuudennaruto-shipuuden, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/naruto-shippuudennaruto-shippuuden, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shippuudenshippuuden and so on. If you have a tag you want to create, tag it with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag and mention it at the end of the question. Someone with higher privileges will come and edit it for you.
Again, this is there to prevent abuse. We don't want spam in comments (especially because comments are currently hard to moderate). 50 reputation is pretty easy to achieve, you can probably make it within the day if you take it easy.
Flag it! Flags let us diamond moderators know that something is wrong. Just flag it with a custom flag, explain that you have an answer but you can't because it's closed, and a moderator is likely to reopen it for you.  (I've done it for you now, go ahead and answer it!)
See point above. Flagging is the right course of action for you here.
All of these privileges are Stack Exchange Network level. 50 reputation points are required to comment on all sites, and 150 (sometimes more) is required to create new tags. However, as you reach 200 points on any site, you'll get a +100 bonus on every other account you make on the site (so the basic privileges like vote up, comment everywhere, etc, are unlocked for you in advance).


I hope you don't find the site too unwelcoming, we're always happy to accept new users. We're a bit more quality oriented than most forums out there though, that's why we're a bit stiffer.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask here on meta, or comment on my answer (you can, since you opened the question).

Happy browsing! 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! I appreciate the reply. I understand the reasons for a lot of these design decisions (on SE's part) but it doesn't make it any less frustrating. :S


















First off, welcome to Anime & Manga SE. Most of these issues you have raised are not specific to this site, and are rather general to Stack Exchange. I'll address these in turn.


  I can't tag one of my most recent questions as "07-ghost" because I don't have 150 reputation...


This is a built-in limit which we have no control over here. Personally, I'd like to see it removed, or at least for new users to be able to suggest tags on their posts. But this is a rather small site on the Stack Exchange network, and the problem is relatively uncommon on most sites, so we have to deal with it.

For now, our suggested solution is to use the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag tag and specify in your question the intended series. A high-rep user will edit the correct tag in. I wish this were more intuitive, but there's really not much we can do about it.


  I can't comment on questions because I don't have 50 reputation...


You can comment on your own questions and answers to those, but you're right that you can't comment elsewhere. That again is Stack Exchange-wide, not specific to this site.

The reason for this is that, unlike new questions and answers, new comments aren't likely to be seen, so it's difficult to identify spam comments. I don't claim that you're a spammer, but the system doesn't quite trust you yet. In any case, the core of the site is questions and answers, and comments are mostly temporary and not worth any rep, so you honestly aren't missing much.


  I found a question I was pretty sure I could answer (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20588/help-in-remembering-an-animeHelp in remembering an anime!) but I can't answer it because you guys voted it "closed"


Here, you've stumbled upon an unfortunate case. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request is somewhat controversial among members of this site. Almost everyone agrees that good identification questions should be allowed. But also, most people agree that a lot of incoming identification questions are low quality and don't stand any realistic chances of being answered.

Because of the volume of incoming questions, we can no longer afford to treat each one individually, so we have some https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892minimum standards for new identification questions. It's worth noting that these guidelines are somewhat controversial, but for now they're the accepted policy. If the question doesn't meet those, we put it on hold until the poster improves it to meet those. In some cases, the question might be answerable even when it doesn't meet the criteria there, but to keep things consistent the rule is still enforced. So, with that in mind, you unfortunately won't be able to answer closed ID questions like that unless the asker comes back and improves it, or you manage to convince other users that it shouldn't have been closed. 

In this case a moderator reopened the question you pointed out, so you should be able to answer it now.


  My attempts to edit it all get rejected because "This edit was intended to address the author of the post and makes no sense as an edit. It should have been written as a comment or an answer." (Fair enough, but editing the answer in is literally my only option.)


I'll assume you are unable to post an answer yourself because the question you're looking at is closed or on-hold. That's the only reason a user like you with more than 10 reputation wouldn't be able to post an answer on an undeleted question. In that case, the users here have decided that it violates one or more of our policies, which you can read in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp center. Usually there will be one or more comments on the question saying what is wrong, and a banner.

In some cases, the question can be improved to be reopened. If it's an identification question, that improvement usually has to come from the asker, but for anything else, you can suggest edits yourself. If your suggestions don't change too much and fix the problem, they'll probably be accepted, and the question will be put in a queue to be judged for reopening. Once it is reopened, you can add your own answer

Alternatively, if you think nothing is wrong, you can flag the question for reopening immediately, or you can come here on meta and ask why the question was closed. Compared to other SE sites, we're actually pretty lax in terms of closing questions, and we'll usually reopen a question if a good argument is made for it.

The one thing that doesn't really make sense to do is to edit existing answers on the question, especially if you're trying to add a bunch of your own thoughts. If the question is closed, that means we've identified that it has problems. If nothing is done about those, we'll probably unfortunately eventually have to delete it. Rather than trying to edit your own answer into another one, you should try to fix the problems of the question first and foremost, and then once that's fixed, post your own answer. That probably sounds like a lot of work for just one question, and it won't happen in a matter of minutes, but questions here are intended to stick around for a long time and in the grand scheme of things our approach eventually gets things right.


  I don't even know if the above issues are because of StackExchange or this specific community...


This is probably because you're still a new user and unfamiliar with the system used here. Try checking out our https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourtour page to get a general idea of what the site is for, and the https://anime.stackexchange.com/helphelp center for more details. If you still have questions, this is the place to ask.



I realize this system is rather unfamiliar to new users, especially those who are used to the more lax policies on fora and social networks. We do judge the quality of posts somewhat strictly, and at the low end a lot of things are restricted to prevent spammers from having their way with the site. I think you've confused that unfamiliarity with us being unwelcoming, but that definitely isn't intended. The low-end limits aren't intended to stick around for very long. You've only been on the site for 2 days, and once you're a bit more familiar with the system and the site and you've earned a bit more rep, those will disappear.

If you're looking for ways to get reputation quickly, I'd suggest checking out the https://anime.stackexchange.com/unansweredunanswered questions. There's a lot of them, and you can probably find a couple that you can answer. You'll probably have more success if you spend a lot of time writing a few well-researched answers to good questions rather than just trying to get an answer on every question you can. Our users here value quality a lot, and are much more likely to upvote an answer which goes above and beyond.

It's also worth noting that if you know a lot about a series that people haven't already asked about, you're allowed (even encouraged) to https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/self-answeranswer your own question, which can be a great way to gain a lot of reputation if you do a good job. Finally, while there aren't any right now, you should keep an eye out for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=featuredbountied questions. If you can answer one of these well, it's an easy way to gain a lot of reputation.

I'm much more used to Reddit / BBC style communities where the mechanics are little more open... I'd upvote your answer on top of accepting it... but 15 reputation. >_>b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mfoy_: Ask a good question about a series that you have recently watched/read. Even things that you have read from elsewhere, which you realize that you couldn't figure it out yourself when you watch/read the anime/manga.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mfoy_ Might I suggest another option here. If you or any other reader, by chance, happens to have a passion in areas where other SE websites operates (SuperUser, Android Enthusiasts, Apple SE, or [more](http://stackexchange.com/sites#)), you might get a relatively higher chance to get rid of these restrictions since SE awards `assoc bonus` of 100 reputation on all of its websites once you reach enough reputation on one site.

There are two recent questions (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20770/is-there-any-anime-with-an-overweight-female-protagonistone and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20789/is-there-any-anime-about-carrom-or-in-which-carrom-is-playedtwo) that ask for the existence of an anime (or manga) that satisfies certain conditions. They are not list questions; rather, they are clear, and probably also focused and answerable (I will get to this later), questions about anime/manga, so many, but not all, people agreed that they should be on-topic here.

If we happen to know of any anime/manga that satisfies the requirements set by the OP, then it is job done. But what about the case that no one is able to identify any such anime/manga? Can we say "no, there is no anime/manga satisfying those conditions?" It is clear that, in this case, the question is not reasonably scoped because no one can ever see all the anime and manga that are out there, and therefore no one is qualified to verify the truth of the claim. Then one question follows another: how do we determine whether questions of this kind are reasonably scoped or not?

I investigated the status of this kind of questions on Sci-Fi SE, and it seems that they are closed as not constructive there (e.g. questions https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/17205/is-there-any-hollywood-sci-fi-movie-which-is-not-an-adaptation-from-some-book-coone and https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/1845/are-there-any-movies-based-on-robert-heinleins-workstwo). Should we do that, too? And if we want to allow existential questions, what should we tag them with? The two questions on Anime & Manga that I mentioned before were tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, but are changed to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history to divert the flow to an already over-saturated tag. However, I feel that both these tags don't adequately describe the nature of those questions well, and we certainly don't want to pollute the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history tag. How should we tag them?

I believe they are akin to out of universe https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-sitelist question.

IMO these questions are poorly scoped and should be closed as unclear/too broad or off-topic (as needed), because they border on being recommendations, are constantly changing, and don't have a definitively answer.

I don't like these type of questions because they usually a pretty broad and unlikely to help anyone. For an example, if I were to ask, is there an anime using depicting focusing on religious iconography? Sure there are, but what of it? We know for a fact that they exist in one form or another, either in the background or the foreground elements of the show. But the question to be answer is, does this help anyone (aside from making a simple point with a local discussion)?  

Note that some of the close reasons are a bit deprecated, I'm currently going through and looking at all out  site policies and doing a comprehensive revision to them.

You bring up a very good point. But comments have also brought up a good point in that it is, nonetheless, the identification of something.

I therefore propose a new tag — or better: a series of tags — to be implemented which signifies you know the series but you want to know details.

If it's a single tag, something along the lines of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/content-identificationcontent-identification, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/element-identificationelement-identification or similar.

If a series is preferred, it is easier to name them:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/character-identificationcharacter-identification
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/other-identificationother-identification
etc.


Of course it is a lot of work to skim through the 1250 questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request at the time of posting this suggestion to potentially retag them, but I think it's possible.

Maybe in that context, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request might also be migrated into https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/series-identificationseries-identification, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-identificationmanga-identification or similar. It would stop people using https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production when they want an anime identified, because when they type manga the 'correct' tag would be suggested.

We had a discussion about this 2 years ago in 
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/578/do-we-need-multiple-history-tagsDo we need multiple history tags?

But I think it's time to review this, we have 2 https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/game-historygame-history questions, 18 https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-historymanga-history questions (10 of which are also tagged with anime) and 62 https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history questions.

As @Logan_M said before, there'll be a lot of overlap of this knowledge and that's shown with the overlap of tags as mentioned above. It also might lead to the creation of many other tags that don't fit exactly in those categories - light novels for example.

we removed https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosplay-historycosplay-history before and haven't really missed it. Shall we merge the tags into one all encompassing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/historyhistory tag?

D: sorrieb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, I see no problem with merging them all into an encompassing "history" tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The issue I take with it is that there are people who are experts in [manga-history], but not [anime-history], and vice-versa.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know if there's that much of a knowledge difference - many of the main figures & events in manga are also present in animeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just wondering, but is game-history on-topic here? Shouldn't that be moved to Arquade.SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves That looks like a badly-named tag that we want to get rid of. The three questions tagged with [tag:game-history] are better off without it.


















As per https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/578/do-we-need-multiple-history-tags#comment1086_582nhahtdh's comment in the linked meta post, tag merging can be done quickly, but undoing a tag merge can be cumbersome. To be on the safe side, unless there is evidence that keeping the tags separate causes harm, I side with not merging the history tags.

Furthermore, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history is to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-historymanga-history as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production is to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production, and I don't think many people will be eager to merge the latter two tags under https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/productionproduction. I imagine there are people who are only interested in the history of anime (maybe they only watch anime and don't read many manga) and vice versa, so even though the two histories are closely tied to each other, I argue that it is useful to separate them. Also, as キルア said in the comment, there are people who are experts in https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-historymanga-history, but not https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history, and vice versa.

Having separate history tags for different media also scales better. If you worry that this might lead to the creation of many other tags that don't fit exactly in those categories, we can maybe tag them all under https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/other-historyother-history.

There are existing questions asking the reason for certain practice done by characters in anime/manga, which are culture-related.

Following the policy Logan M suggested, these questions would be off-topic, since the scenes in anime/manga simply reflect the culture in real life, and by replacing anime reference with an image or video in real life, those question would become Japanese culture questions.

However, I think those questions have value on Anime & Manga.SE, since they help viewers better understand the Japanese culture, so they can further appreciate the anime/manga itself. It would also be more natural for the people who see a certain scene in anime/manga and want to understand what is going on to come here and ask their questions here.

Questions from https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cultureculture aside, we are bound to run into questions asking about references to real-life Japanese events/politics/people/popular culture/etc. in series such as Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Joshiraku or Tesagure Bukatsumono. Those topics are at odd with the site scope. However, to understand those references, it is necessary for the answer to draw knowledge from those fields to adequately explain them.

On the other hand, I wouldn't want our site flooded with direct questions about Japanese culture without any reference to anime/manga, since it would go outside the site scope and attract the wrong audience.

I currently can't think of a policy, since I'm not sure of all the cases that we don't want. However, I think a policy regarding culture questions should:

Allow


What/Why do [these characters] perform [this action]?
What is [this cultural phenomenon] portrayed in many different anime?
[This anime] claims [some cultural fact]. Is it true?


Using some example questions from http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/59039/japanese-cultureJapanese Culture proposal as example, these questions would be allowed if there is a scene in the anime/manga/etc. mentioning the cultural practice:


Why does Japanese society put so much emphasis on hierarchical relationships? (上下関係)
Why are you supposed to take your shoes off when you enter somebody's home?
Why do the Japanese tie omikuji fortunes to fences and tree limbs?
Why does [this character] reject [this item] as omiyage (gift)? 

(Modified from What items are should you avoid giving as an omiyage (gift)?)
Why are [these numbers] considered lucky or unlucky in Japan?

(Modified from What numbers are considered lucky or unlucky in Japan?)
Why is it rude to stab your chopsticks into your rice/pass food with chopsticks/other chopstick etiquette?
Why is it that lost items are often returned to the police rather than stolen?
What are the sociocultural factors that contribute to the very long working hours often seen in Japanese companies?
Why did Japan develop such a strong cultural objection to gun ownership?
Why do [the characters] say that towel is not allowed in onsen?

(Modified from Are you expected to be naked in an onsen resort? If so would it be unacceptable to wear a swimming costume?)
Why are New Year celebrations Shinto, marriages Christian, and funerals Buddhist in Japan? [Should be split into 3 questions, each cite examples from anime/manga/etc. Hard to actually pull this off, though]


(Although I list these questions here, some of them I doubt will never get asked here, since there is no anime talking about them)

Disallow


What is considered [rude/taboo/good] when [doing something] according to Japanese culture?
What is the origin of [some cultural practice]?


Using some example questions from http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/59039/japanese-cultureJapanese Culture proposal as example, these questions would be disallowed:


Are Ninja as culturally popular in Japan as they currently are in English-speaking countries, especially the USA?
Does Japan have a similar or equivalent practice of [another culture's practice]?
In what situations is a yukata worn versus a kimono?
As a visitor from the United States, is it polite or rude for me to bow?
Is shrugging your shoulders considered rude in Japan?
What should you bring when you are invited to a Japanese person's home for dinner?
Does Japan have a similar or equivalent practice of [another culture's practice]?
What are the earliest known origins of onigiri (rice balls)?
When did the association of white flowers with death and funerals begin?
When did tattoos become associated with yakuza?
What are the differences in dress between geisha and maiko? Do they have different responsibilities as well?


I hope to use these example questions to draw a line of what to include, and what not to, from which we can observe and generalize it into a policy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, these questions have value - If people don't understand a scene because of cultural reasons, it seems to me that they should be allowed ask about it. I think your examples are quite apt


















This answer comes as a counter-proposal answer to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2334/274@nhahtdh's.
Let me first state my fundamental viewpoint: If we allow these questions to be asked without using anime as context, we open the door to all kinds of off-topic questions. Everything from https://stackoverflow.com/programming to https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/outdoor living becomes on-topic. And that's... bad.


Following the policy Logan M suggested, these questions would be off-topic

This is incorrect. The anime cited in these questions (well, at least three of them) is required to give the question context.
Take, for example, Why strike stones taken from inside a pot against each other?. If we remove all references to the anime, we get:

I saw someone taking two stones from a pot, and striking them against each other. What does it mean? Is it some kind of supernatural belief?

For all we know, it could be starting a fire with two blocks of flint. The environment, actions, and characters present in the scene are necessary to answer it. Even if you saw someone doing this in real life, you wouldn't have the context of the son leaving home.
Contrast with Check and circle marks in test papers, and you get:

I came across a test paper containing someone's score. However, it is interesting to note that the correct answers are circled while the wrong ones are ticked (checked?). As far as I know, ticks are for correct answers and circles are for incorrect answers (unless I've been living in a shell, which would be embarrassing).
The person who wrote this intentionally placed an incorrect answer for question #1. As you can see, it is checked while the rest are circled. Does this mirror how Japan marks the test papers of students? If so, why?

Aside from the possible lacking context that this is happening in Japan, nothing changes. It is a question about how a test paper is marked, not about anime, nor even about its characters. You could argue that you'd have to know about Keima Katsuragi answering the first one wrong intentionally, so I'm willing to let this one slide with an edit (to show the focus).


However, I think those questions have value on Anime & Manga.SE, since they help viewers better understand the Japanese culture, so they can further appreciate the anime/manga itself

Perhaps this will sound harsh, but why are we tasked with helping people appreciate anime and manga? SO is not asked with helping people appreciate code, Math.SE is not tasked with helping people appreciate math, and so on. While it is fantastic that we can help people understand their favorite anime and manga through our site, it is not our responsibility to sell the medium.
Moreover, it's hard to make the argument that anime is really culturally fulfilling. While some like Uchouten Kazoku will provide more cultural themes, if we judged Japanese culture by anime, we'd not only severely overestimate the amount of lolis in Japan, but also miss out on things that are truly important to their culture. (Kind of like learning about World War II by watching Captain America.)
If they want to understand Japanese culture better, that's up to them. We could also help them better understand Japanese language used in anime and manga by making those kind of questions on-topic, but that would be silly. Instead, any https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/japanese-languagejapanese-language questions require context from the anime or manga in order to be answered. (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4839/274(Good), https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4111/274(Bad))

It would also be more natural for the people who see a certain scene in anime/manga and want to understand what is going on to come here and ask their questions here

Of course. So, come ask about the scene. Describe the characters, atmosphere, and how they relate to what's going on. The anime has to give the question context.


Those topics are at odd with the site scope. However, to understand those references, it is necessary for the answer to draw knowledge from those fields to adequately explain them.

Yes. This is an ongoing problem. We will frequently have questions that require information from the real world, such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20982/274this world map question. This is why we have contributors that have varied interests, such as physics, language studies, programming, art, and so on. But, this is not to say that this varied skill base is where we should focus the site. That's a bad idea.

As for your question list, I see some that would be good questions.

Why does [this character] reject [this item] as omiyage (gift)?
Sure! Maybe that character had a specific reason to reject that item.

... Unfortunately, I also saw quite a few that would be bad questions.

Why do the Japanese tie omikuji fortunes to fences and tree limbs?
Absolutely not. This is entirely about Japan, and has nothing to do with anime, even if you found an anime with someone doing it.

And yet, you place some questions in the "disallow" pile that I think are bad for the same reason.

As a visitor from the United States, is it polite or rude for me to bow?
Why is this more off-topic than the one about omijuki? If I rephrased it as Is it rude for visitors from other countries to bow in Japan?, would that be "on-topic"?


If we do not have a policy in place like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/611/274@Logan's, then we will be forced to accept these questions as on topic:

Why are pagodas pointy?
(I saw a pagoda in an anime. Why is it pointy on top?)
Why do people drive on the left side of the road?
(In anime, people always drive on the left. Why?)

At this point you're probably thinking that we can just downvote or close the "bad ones". But that leaves us with the issue that the criteria used to select "bad" questions will become entirely subjective. People will say road rules obviously have nothing to do with anime and close it, but anyone who's curious or unsure about what Golden Week is will probably be more than happy to leave it open.
Recall the text of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cultureculture that Logan posted above.

Questions about anime and manga in the broader context of Japanese culture.

Asking what Golden Week is, or why a test is scored backwards, is not about anime, nor about manga. (Nor related media.) It is about Japanese culture, or worse, culture in general. It belongs here as much as asking "What's Christmas?" on https://movies.stackexchange.com/Movies & TV.

My opinion: We should retain https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/611/274@Logan's policy on the matter. If a question cannot be asked without requiring details or context from an anime, manga, or on-topic medium, the question is off-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`As a visitor from the United States, is it polite or rude for me to bow?` Actually, I think it might be on-topic (in the context of my answer) if the asker can provide an anime reference showing people rejecting a bow from foreigner (for example). However, the chance is extremely slim. The same goes for your edited version. `Does hair become whiter with age?` (and the other question) These are bad examples. They are not related to culture.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh Pretty much every question posed there is on-topic by that standard. Nevertheless, I will replace those two questions with equally absurd cultural questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regard to `Why strike stones taken from inside a pot against each other?` My point is that if you remove anime reference and add sufficient real life context, the question would become a viable culture question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Pretty much every question posed there is on-topic by that standard.` On retrospect, it might be the case. However, the fact that we require an anime/manga reference to serve as context for asking the question will limit the questions people can ask.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I provided an explicit reason why witnessing the act in real life would not be enough context. You would have literally no way of knowing the boy was not coming back, or where he was going. And yes, my point is that we **do** need that context; it seems that you're suggesting a policy in which the idea of "context" is **way** too lenient. (A single example is not context.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then how do we know if an equivalent real life example does not provide sufficient context compared to one from anime?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I don't think I get what you're asking. To be clear, I'm saying that *only* anime context should be allowed. (Questions giving only real-life examples are off-topic.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(I think my thought has stray a bit too far). I mean the current policy may disallow more than what we think. Let's say if the question includes enough information (context, etc.) that it can survive even when any mention of it happening in [some anime] is removed - won't this be disallowed by the current policy?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What would you think of "Why does [the character] tie a fortune to a tree limb?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko Seems fine. Keep in mind the character may have a motivation outside the culture itself, so that's the kind of information that makes the question feasible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア okay, this makes sense. I think it's the wording of "remove anime reference" which is confusing.


















I was looking at https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21245/2604this question and wanted to add the series tag for it. Unfortunately, there's no tag to the effect of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-irregular-at-magic-high-schoolthe-irregular-at-magic-high-school. Since the title sounded reasonably familiar, I thought I'd search for irregular magic in the site to check if some form of the Japanese title was being used instead, and it turns out https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mahouka-koukoumahouka-koukou is being used right now.

Might some tag with some form of the English title be added as a synonym? At least as someone who doesn't follow the series, this was a bit confusing, and fact that the post initially was only tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic doesn't seem to be a point in favour of the current state of things.

Of course, it's possible that this is a series where the Japanese title is either easy to remember (e.g. Gin no Saji) or used frequently enough on the internet (e.g. SnK) that this wouldn't matter to the asker: I wouldn't know since I don't follow the series.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps add English tag synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So you entered the variant of the work's title that you knew and  found the tag you were looking for. Is there really need to have a synonym now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase: I didn't know the Japanese title and was almost going to put [tag:retag] on the question and ask a question about it on meta. The only reason I didn't was because I vaguely recalled questions on the series asked before. I had to run a search separately to find questions on the series (so as to figure out what tag they were using).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's just not really user-friendly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I meant that tag excerpts should solve the problem by including the most commonly used variants of a work's name, so that they will appear in tag list if you type one of them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmmmm, weirdly enough, they didn't here. I did get the English title from the tag exerpt here, but the contents of the tag excerpt don't show up in the tag list unless the word I'm typing is already in the tag itself: for instance, I typed `flowers` in the tags page, and did not get [tag:aku-no-hana].b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you find a series missing English title, you can flag for synonym creation. Do use Google to look for the official/localized title, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/933/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Tag searches on /tags and in the tag autocompleter box when asking a question both don't search tag excerpts. They only search tag names (including synonym names).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon Incidentally, I added a syn for [the-flowers-of-evil] to [aku-no-hana]


















The problem with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-irregular-at-magic-high-schoolthe-irregular-at-magic-high-school is that it's over 25 characters long, which is the maximum tag length. We do have synonyms between the English and Japanese versions of serieses.

If you can suggest a decent, intuitive English tag name, I'll happily add it as a synonym (Also, you can suggest it easily from the tag's page, under synonyms).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't suggest synonyms without a score of 5 from answers -- I only have a score of 2 (and pretty much only because I once saw a question I could answer without knowledge of the series). I was going to suggest something like [tag:irregular-magic-high-school], but that's apparently still 2 characters too long. I suppose omitting `high` would get the count sufficiently down, particularly since the main issue for me is that I'd want someone typing `the irregular` or `irregular` to be able to locate the tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we ask the dev to raise the character limit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh Hahahaha I wish. There's [a feature request for this](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/209248/) on Meta.SE, but I doubt this is ever going to happen because of course SO doesn't need long tags, so why would anyone else?


















The rules

If you create a tag for a visual novel (or an anime adaptation thereof), I will award you a 50-reputation bounty, provided that: 


The question is posted during the month of May 2015.
The question receives a net score of at least +1 by June 7, 2015, and isn't closed or deleted. (We want good questions, not bad ones.) 
You have posted at least one answer on the site with a score of at least 0. (Bounties can only be awarded to answers, not questions.)
You have less than 20,000 reputation at the time of this posting. (This excludes Krazer / Jon Lin. Users with 20,000 reputation will have all privileges after graduation, and don't really need any more rep.) This is a change from the April 2015 contest, where the cutoff was 15,000 reputation.


If you do not have https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsenough reputation to create a tag (150 rep), that's fine - post the question anyway with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag, and somebody will come by and make a tag for you. I will give you (rather than the higher-rep user who physically creates the tag) credit for creating the tag.

In the interest of getting broader participation, I will award at most 4 bounties (so, 200 reputation) to any one user. This is a change from the April 2015 contest.

Eligible tags

Below, I list a number of popular visual novels (and anime adaptations thereof) that don't have tags yet. However, any visual novel that doesn't have a tag is eligible to win a bounty, as long as you leave a comment here mentioning it. The list below is mostly provided to suggest some things you might want to read/watch if you don't have any particular questions in mind.

/questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed

This bug applies to any page with a tag editor (ask question, edit question, edit tags, etc.). The synonym tags do not show up in the list of available tags when the name is partially typed.

Using https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/assassination-classroomassassination-classroom as an example, it currently has https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ansatsu-kyoushitsuansatsu-kyoushitsu as synonym. However, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ansatsu-kyoushitsuansatsu-kyoushitsu doesn't show up when ans is typed in the tag editor.

This totally defeats the purpose of having Japanese tag synonyms, as they are supposed to help user to find the correct series tag.



/questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed

The desired behavior is the current behavior in the search box of https://anime.stackexchange.com/tagstags listing. It turned out that it is also buggy.

While the search box works with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ansatsu-kyoushitsuansatsu-kyoushitsu, it doesn't work with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-legend-of-koizumithe-legend-of-koizumi when searching for koi (it is a synonym of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mudazumo-naki-kaikakumudazumo-naki-kaikaku).

There is no "moral guideline" for answering questions here. If you want to answer the question, answer it; if the community thinks it's bad enough that it shouldn't be answered, then it will be put on hold.

On larger sites like Stack Overflow, I often see people getting belittled for answering "simple", "obvious", or "bad" questions (whether they have close votes or not). To me, this goes against the spirit of a Q&A site.

Does it "encourage" more bad questions? Jury's out on this one, since we can't survey people to see what they'd ask before and after they see a "bad" question on our site. That said, there will always be people who ask bad questions, whether we answer them or not.

My opinion: If you want to answer the question, answer it. You helped someone find the information they were looking for when no one else would. A+, my friend.

You should totally answer it. The quality of the question does not determine the quality of your answer. Even if the question is bad and closed, your answer can still help people. And if you want to improve the question, but for some reason it's not possible, post your own version of the question with your own answer, eve if that means it will be closed as a dupe of the original one. SE guidelines are just that. Do what makes sense and preserve the best parts.

I originally brought this topic up, so I feel I should probably post my feelings on the matter. I realise the topic has somewhat divided the community and while I regret that, I think the topic needed to be raised.

Here's my take:

I enjoy the maid café. However, I think the image auto-posts can be objectionable. Some users may think this is over-sensitive, but I think as a site that ideally wants to be all-inclusive, that this complaint is valid.

As much as I like cute girls, having them as a focal point of the image stream is somewhat objectifying them and women in general. For an example: would it be acceptable if in Movies & TV there was a constant stream of cute female actors? Probably not.

The images do encourage discussion and helps the empty chatroom problem that many chatrooms face (no recent history of chat == no sign that people are willing to talk). For this, I appreciate the bot. However, I would prefer that the images are content-checked to be:


Non-single-gendered


I think this is covered in my point before about objectification, but it would be better if we had a mix of character art from other genders also.


Non-suggestive/Explicit


In general this isn't really a problem, but occasionally there are images that fit in this bracket. Many people browse this site at work and I'm sure they don't really want their boss to see that on their computer. Not to mention, we are also a 13s-friendly site and don't particularly want to get mislabelled as inappropriate content on internet filters. Obviously this is very subjective and in general I think we need a policy on this site for this content in our questions/answers and on our chat site.



What can we do?

Obviously, a good bit of work has gone into the bot in creation, image population and it has it's merits as mentioned before - I don't want to get rid of it, but I would appreciate it if the choice of images were varied. It doesn't have to be just a mix of genders, but a mixture of landscapes and other anime art would probably give more value to the bot. a possible solution is to pull the top images off of Pivix or something - this way the content will be not user-selected and therefore come with uncertainty over if people like Kyouko will whine about it.

Another (extreme) option is removing that part of the bot's functionality altogether. I think this is possible, there was a suggestion from another user for other conversation-starting auto-posts, for example: a random anime/manga.

I do not think hiding the image in a link/obfuscation is a valid solution, it's better - but it still has the implications of objectifying women. I would like the Maid Café to be free of that negative attitude.



I realise there are some reservations from the other users for various reasons. Here are some possible answers to possible reservations.


What about all the current images in the bot's list?


To be frank, that shouldn't be a consideration in this issue. It's not a feasibilty question, it's an appropiateness question.


You can go through the images yourself and remove the ones that you find inappropiate.


Why should a user be obligated to police someone else's work rather than the contributors making sure their content is acceptable. I think it's reasonable to expect users to flag content they don't agree with - but going through external products is out of scope to be honest.


What gives you the right to speak for women?


I'm not speaking for women, I'm speaking as a user of the site. I personally don't like the idolization that the stream of images represent - and if I feel this way, I'm sure others who are more offence-taking than me feel similarly, or stronger.


But we love cute girls, I don't want cute dudes.


This ironically is a flip of the problem. What if Anime & Manga was full of women posting cute men? 



Just as a conclusion, I'd like that people keep this discussion constructive - I'd rather not have a flurry of objections on chat/in the comments to this post. If you have alternate suggestions/reactions please post another answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Policing someone else's work is what SE is all about though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When i checked this meta post, i had various points to say but they all are covered here fully. +1. Specially for the point of using site on work.


















I've generally had good experiences — I certainly can't think of any bad ones — but I could see, as a woman, people being slightly uncomfortable with things, and I definitely have felt that way before. For instance, the chat desciption is:


  We're now serving anime & manga with a side of Moé. Smiles are free and the lolis are the best.


Granted, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/894/2604what moe is is a bit vague, but the impression I get of it, combined with my impression of "lolis", is slightly off-putting, particularly since the latter has sexual connotations for me, and particularly since I've only ever seen it used in the context of female characters.

I wasn't offended by the stuff in the image archive — there was a link on chat — but pretty much every image I saw was of a female character, and some of them were even kind of sexualized, even if I'd consider them borderline safe for work. I'd hardly go around screaming claims of sexism because of this. It's probably not much worse than the slight, innocent discomfort I might feel among male friends discussing between themselves women they're attracted to, and this could well just be due to site demographics.

But it's still not quite a good thing. At the very least, it might make me sceptical of being more involved with the community. I don't see it downright turning off users from asking questions: outside of chat, it's easy to avoid potentially irksome stuff, particularly if you don't follow the "right" series, because questions are supposed to be "professional". Perhaps as a bare-bones Q&A site, that's fine, but it doesn't seem ideal.

I wouldn't really care if this were simply intermittent conversations between users, but as something a regular chatbot is involved with, it's not the most welcoming. (As an analogy of sorts, I'll provide this: I like Monogatari's Hanekawa, but it's tiring to see people on the internet only post pictures of the sexualized Black Hanekawa or of her infamous cleavage.)

Thus, I think https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2351/2604Toshinou Kyouko's suggestions are mostly appropriate and in order.

She is, IMO, the most interesting character in the series, but many of the images online fit with Hitagi's description of her to Kaiki in Koimonogatari: "Tsubasa Hanekawa. My classmate. She has big boobs."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda: yep, definitely. I guess the point I was trying to make with that is that while inevitably there will be cute girls and yuri floating around (similar to how it's entirely understandable that images of a sexualized Black Hanekawa will be around), I find it tiring (for lack of a better word) when that's the entire focus. (Naturally, in the case of cute girls and yuri, I also _geniunely_ like some of the it, but less stuff catered to the slightly sexualized, somewhat male-oriented area would be less monotonous.)

As someone involved in this, I'll state the complaints I see and exactly what I propose to improve the situation. My goal is not to create a perfect world without sexism or anything dramatic like that, but simply to get things to a point where any user on the main site feels comfortable participating in chat. We can debate feminist theory and the effect of anime/manga on women in Japan another time, but frankly, that's only marginally relevant here and our goals are much more down-to-earth.



First, I feel I should clarify the situation. There are two connected components that together determine the effect the bot has on the chatroom. The bot itself is a piece of software written by Hakase which accepts links to images and posts them randomly according to rules which can be modified by verified users (room owners and moderators last I checked) and on-command. In principle, any user who wants to can add any image they like to the bot. The goal of this was to create something which would allow users here to upload their favorite anime/manga-themed images images and save them for times when the chat has downtime. This would create more discussion. I will refer to this as the bot.

In practice, I'm the only user who has done so, so the collection is rather slanted to my own interests. Those interests are somewhat limited. I have a collection of approximately 25000 images which I collected over a period of several months. I've uploaded them to Google Drive and fed them to the bot about 1-2k at a time when it gets low on images. I'll refer to this component as my library.

It's important that these two components are not conflated. The bot itself was always intended to be a community project. The fact is that there isn't much community involvement in it, but that's really the problem here. Because of that, it is drawing exclusively from my library, and gives off the impression that the entire community's interests are the same as mine, which is not exactly true.



Now that this clarification is out of the way, I've seen complaints that basically fall into 2 categories. The solution to both of these is more community involvement, but it's useful to differentiate the two since they're conceptually very different. This post is rather long, so I've made a tl;dr version for the solution to each of these problems.

1. The bot posts some inappropriate images

I've heard this from a relatively small number of people, but it seems to come up repeatedly. It's rare that people can point to a specific image and say exactly what makes it inappropriate, but there is a general sense among some users that some of the images aren't as unobjectionable individually as one might like.

To be clear, this is a complaint about my library, not the bot itself. As such, I'll detail the procedure I go through to check the images and my goals in doing so.

Initially, when downloading images, I used various image boards. Pixiv was probably the most common, followed by Danbooru, Sankaku channel, e-shuushuu, yande.re, and konachan. Most of these sites are not work-safe, but all the ones which aren't safe rate images, and in searching, I stuck to those images rated as "safe". This already removes anything sexually explicit, most nudity, etc. The downloads were done by hand.

In reviewing the images, I noticed that a small number of them were still perhaps debatable, even though they had been classified as "safe" rather than "questionable". They were mostly no worse than things we've posted in chat before, but since the bot would be posting randomly on command and would be a regular user, upon talking to the other room regulars, we figured that the images it posts should be held to some higher scrutiny than what we'd hold the regulars to.

As such, when I upload images, I manually hand-check each one and see that it conforms to reasonable standards. Since users under the age of 13 aren't permitted on SE, it seems reasonable that the bot should be permitted to post roughly PG-13 level images, but in practice I aimed for mostly PG-level. For reference, the sorting is not solely to remove images which are not appropriate, but also to remove those which are not of particularly high quality.

Because of the sheer magnitude of images needed (the bot posts 20 images per day, which means we need over 1000 new ones every 2 months) these checks have to be done quickly. In practice I average 5-10 seconds per image, which means that going through about 1200 images (which will produce about 1000 to be posted in chat) takes about 2 1/2 hours by hand. 

In checking, I have a small number of hard-and-fast rules for what to remove. Anything with nudity or visible underwear is removed. There are a small number of other less common rules I follow. Beyond that, anything I'd need to think twice about uploading from my account, whether or not I'd actually do it, is removed. The end result is that the collection is significantly more conservative than what I myself would post. I've seen many other users (including many of those who are now complaining) post images that would not meet these standards.

-

I say all this not because I think it means that I should get a free pass, but simply to say that this is something that I'm already putting a great deal of effort into. I think the large majority of the images posted are not objectionable individually. There may be a small number of seriously objectionable posts that I miss. This is inevitable; I can't spend several minutes on each image dissecting it, and even if I could, there would always be a small miss-click rate. This small number might still create an impression on the regulars; if it's only 2% of all images, that still comes out to 3 or 4 images per week at the current rate, which a user might see as a much more statistically significant trend than it actually is.

Beyond that, there are images that some users have complained about, but can't explain exactly what the issue is. Upon investigating such cases, I (and often some other users) can't see anything wrong. This illustrates an important principle that what is appropriate is subjective. If it were possible to do so, I'd read the minds of all the regulars and check that each image is acceptable to each one. But I don't have the ability to read minds, and I can't see what one would complain about in many of these cases. I'm happy to refine my methods further if people have concrete criticisms that lead to useful checks that can be performed quickly by eye. But I'm already incorporating every check I can think of at the moment, so simply saying that an image is "NSFW" or "suggestive" without qualifying what exactly in the image is the problem is not particularly helpful, because in all but the rare cases of a mistake on my part, the image is SFW by my standards. I encourage those who think there are systematic errors in my methodology to point these out so that I can improve it. 

On the other hand, if you see a questionable image, but can't exactly explain what the problem is, I'd suggest you think a little bit more about what is actually wrong with it. If it isn't something you can explain after thinking about it, it's probably highly subjective and you may want to try to have a bit more open mind about it at least until you can figure out what the problem is. This isn't really any different from anything else in life; for example, while some people have opinions on others without having any solid reason or explanation for their opinions, it generally behooves open-minded and intelligent individuals to explore these opinions and discover the reasons behind them. But if you're sure the image is inappropriate, and still can't explain why, keep reading.

I'm also not saying that users should ignore these few inappropriate images. That doesn't solve the problem. The bot shouldn't be the reason an active user on the site doesn't want to go to chat, even if they only see inappropriate images rarely.

-

The solution I propose is that (other) users become more involved in moderating the bot to deal with these potential issues. Just like the main site, the way we can get this to work is by community moderation, which is only fitting given that the bot was always intended to be a community-run project.

I'm perfectly happy to allow any other chat users who want to do so to inspect the images in my library before they're fed to the bot (in fact, I've asked several times if there is any interest in doing so).  but that doesn't solve the problem completely.

Preliminary inspection can only go so far, since even if my library is totally clean, there's little to stop other users from uploading their own images which don't conform to the same standards. What we need is for people to be moderating the bot's images. This is allegedly a community project. It was started with broad community support to provide the community a nice tool to keep conversations going and interesting. But now, it seems that everyone in the community other than me is no longer interested in contributing. If we want the bot to be running in the main room, it behooves regulars of the room to at least familiarize themselves with its internal moderation capabilities and apply these when appropriate.

First off, the bot can (and should) be turned off during long serious discussions, such as those related to meta policy. This can be done via the command #post disable. You can also modify the parameters such as how often it will post or how many messages to wait between posts; for more details I suggest referring to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1166/191this meta post about Maid Café chat room bots.

More importantly, when an image does appear that isn't appropriate, you have the ability to remove it within 2 minutes. The command #undo will remove the last posted message by the bot. While I've seen many users complain about messages, few if any have bothered to actually remove them with this. I'm not sure if that's because it is not sufficiently well-known or for other reasons, but in any case, that's available. This should be done if the image is definitely not appropriate for the room.

Secondly, if you personally don't want a given image on your screen, but it isn't clearly inappropriate, the #unbox command will edit the previous message to add an extra character after it within 2 minutes. This will allow other users to click the link to see the image, but you won't need to see it. The current functionality is slightly broken; it will still edit the message, but not correctly convert it to a link. This should be fixed shortly.

To be perfectly clear, these functions are available for any users, and everyone should feel welcome to use them. I ask that you reserve #undo for clearly inappropriate cases and use #unonebox in questionable cases. But no one should feel like they have to put up with a particular image on their screen which makes them uncomfortable from a bot whose intent is to make chat more enjoyable and comfortable for everyone who wants to join.

While these are pretty good and should make moderation easy enough, I think we can also do more on the software end of things to make the bot more flexible. 2 minutes is a fairly short amount of time, and it's possible to miss an image for that long that you want to get rid of. While the image will usually fall off the screen that quickly, it may still be visible to some users with certain user scripts installed on the star board or if you scroll the screen up. 

A regular user (like the bot) can't delete or edit their own messages after that amount of time though. For now, you can message me or another chat mod to get them removed, but that's less than ideal, and chat flags are even worse. Ideally, I'd like for the bot to have room-owner privileges, which it could use to move messages after the 2-minute deadline to a different designated bin room. This functionality does not yet exist, but if it is implemented, that would allow users to deal with such messages after 2 minutes. This is something I'm only somewhat considering right now, and there are possible objections to having the bot be a room-owner, but if this complaint continues to arise, it may be the best option.

-

TL;DR: There are several functions already available to anyone to moderate the bot. We can't hope to solve this completely without community involvement, nor should we try to since it's always been a community project.


#post disable turns off the posting module.
#undo removes inappropriate messages within 2 minutes.
#unonebox converts the one-box to a link to remove questionable images from your screen while keeping them accessible to other users.
If 2 minutes is not enough time, we can try adding a function to bin an image, which would have no time limit. Feedback is appreciated on this suggestion.
In the interim, you can message a mod to deal with any other cases, or in particularly egregious cases use the chat flag system (though it's definitely preferable to use the bot's own internal moderation capabilities whenever possible).  I can't speak for any of the other mods, but I at least will be fine removing or unoneboxing any image someone complains about, whether or not I agree with their complaint.


But, in any event, I don't believe that the seriously inappropriate images are actually extremely frequent, given the amount of work I've done in pruning my library. They may occasionally occur, but they're something of a red herring here. Still, feel free to liberally use the above moderation tools; they're there to be used.



2. The overall effect of the bot's sole focus on female characters has the aggregate effect of objectifying women.

Let's clarify this, since the use of "objectifying" here is not standard, at least in the feminist literature I'm familiar with. The current collection of images is essentially all female characters. The aggregate effect of a bot which only posts females gives off the impression (true or otherwise) that the community is only concerned with female characters. It would not be a great leap in inference to assume that the (mostly male) community here is primarily interested in female characters for the sake of their femininity as an object to be distilled and consumed regularly, and then relating that back to real life, may get the impression that this is a somewhat sexist community.

This is different from the sort of objectification you hear about in e.g. movies. In movies, the complaint is the reduction of a (typically female) character's personality and role to that of an object which is effectively owned by another (typically male) character; this is an in-universe phenomenon that the viewer has no part in beyond observing and internalizing. Here, since we have still images, the complaint has nothing to do with story or personality; rather, it's about the perception of this community that a stream of images of feminine characters creates. No individual image is objectifying in this way, as none of them are able to depict characteristics or story and exist only to be consumed. In the standard sense, this is really weird terminology which would seem to have us objectifying a character from an anime or illustration which is literally already an object to be consumed by us; it's hard to see how that is an issue if you don't look deeper.

But having many of these images together without any others may still have some effect on the perception of our community. Specifically, it may have the effect of associating us with the idea of objectifying women and leading to the inference that we are fans of such objectification (valid or not). So I'm not particularly a fan of the use of "objectification" in this way, but we'll stick with it since I don't think there's a significantly better standard term in the literature I've read.

-

To be perfectly clear, this was not my intent when compiling the images. I've explained my thought process thoroughly http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/21524297#21524297in this chat message; I don't think it bears repeating here simply because it isn't particularly important. One of the lessons of feminist literature (and more generally literature on all culturally disadvantaged groups) is that something which is intended as acceptable and reasonable can still be unintentionally perceived as discriminatory or aggressive. I think we may have fallen into a minor case of that here.

I don't think this would be such a problem if it were only me doing it, but a bot has an illusion (true or false) of being community-supported. The impression is that the only value we find in anime/manga is the abundance of cute girls, which is not true for most of the users here.

-

Let's be honest about this. The bot is basically a red herring when it comes to this complaint. It's an easy target since it's visible to regulars, but it isn't even close to solely responsible for the perception of our community.

Our main chatroom's name is "Maid Café (メイド喫茶)". That already probably turns off a lot of users including some women. The concept of a maid cafe isn't exactly gender-neutral. Furthermore, the description is written in a mixture of English and incredibly ugly italic Japanese text with a bunch of very technical terms that the average person would not understand or would potentially be turned off by.

Our dialogue isn't even close to gender-neutral either. Forget the bots; our users enjoy talking about things like fanservice scenes and praising lolicon. The images the bot tosses out aren't even close to the worst ones that get posted. And this isn't a new thing; chat has been that way since long before we had any bots. Indeed, the bot was initially created to automate a process I and other users were doing manually of posting images during downtime, predominantly of female characters.

-

Now, before we go any further, we need to ask ourselves to what degree this is actually a bad thing. "Objectification" is something of a feminist buzzword, but we have to question whether it's actually a problem here.

In some ways, it really isn't such a bad thing. Yes, it has the effect of excluding some people from chat. But exclusion isn't a bad thing; it's the principle on which Stack Exchange was built. For those confused by this, I highly suggest this great talk by Joel Spolsky. The relevant section begins about 14 minutes in, but the whole talk is interesting:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpGA2fmAHvMThe Cultural Anthropology of Stack Exchange

The point is that the way Stack Exchange works best is by creating an atmosphere that is significantly more welcoming to experts than to those who aren't. In the context of anime, our goal should be to make an atmosphere that experts find comfortable, and users who don't know or care about anime will not have any interest in. Chat being the deepest level of the site, it should be the most biased in that way towards keeping the expert interested users around and active.

I don't think anyone will question that there's a definite correlation between people who appreciate the bot's output and people who have a strong interest in anime. So, in some sense, the bot is really doing a good thing here.

But that's only at a very surface level. While interest in the bot does correlate with anime expertise, it also correlates with all sorts of other spurious things that we don't really need. Female anime fans are probably less interested than male ones, and fans of genres like action or (heterosexual) romance may feel left-out too.

I don't know whether the overall positive effect is bigger or smaller than the overall negative effect, or even if they're comparable. But we can keep most of the positive effects and get rid of the negative effects. These are real issues that we should try to solve and can make some progress with here, unlike the huge goal of ending objectification of women (which we're simply in no position to deal with on any real scale).

-

Getting rid of the bot isn't going to fix sexism in the world, or even in our chatroom. It isn't going to change our culture. Nor is it going to make more women interested in anime and manga as a whole. 

And this isn't the headquarters of some feminist organization, it's a chatroom about a Q&A site for Japanese cartoons and comic books. We need to accept that anime and manga aren't gender-neutral, and that nothing we do here is going to change that, nor should that be our goal. Anime is still primarily made for a male fanbase and our site's demographics are accordingly skewed more towards men than women (according to Quantcast; incidentally, we aren't anywhere near as skewed as a lot of other sites like many of the tech sites). There are some very positive effects anime and manga have on gender-roles in Japanese culture, but also some negative ones, and like it or not, we're bound to both of these here.

Our goal should just be to make a chatroom that main-site users feel comfortable and welcome in.

So with the more modest goal of representing anime fans equitably rather than trying to cure "objectification", there's some real progress we can make.

-

The solution to this, to the extent that we need to solve it, is in fact quite similar to the other problem. We need more people adding more images of their own interests to the bot. The bot is supposed to represent the community's interests as a whole. Instead, it's come to represent solely (a subset of) my interests.

In fact, any user already has the ability to add images to the bot. There's few real rules about what the images should be either. Anything you want to add is fair game, be it cute girls, handsome men, or artichokes. The only serious rule is that everything should be appropriate and on-topic (and the latter is using the broadest possible interpretation of on-topic).

The process is unfortunately a bit complicated. I intend to make another meta post detailing the steps I take so that other users can follow the same steps. However, anyone can do it who is sufficiently interested in doing so.

I encourage other users whose interests don't (or do, if you like) match mine to add your own images. I'm not going to go out of my way to look for a ton of images that I don't even care about (or rather, I can't, since I can't even judge them effectively), but everyone else should feel free to share their own interests through the bot. That's what it was originally intended for, and to the extent that people are having issues with it now, it's because there isn't enough participation on this front.

I don't know if this will cure the issue of "objectification" from a constant stream of images of female characters. But what it will do is make the stream of images representative of what we do care about and are interested in. More diversity in interests, so long as they remain anime- and manga-related, is surely a good thing in  light of what impression it gives off of our community. And if we get a lot of fujoshi in chat who really want to share their love of BL or male idols or shotas, I'm perfectly happy with that so long as it stays on-topic and appropriate, and that might help counteract the image that all this community cares about is cute girls. Or we might end up with 35000 different images of artichokes if that suddenly becomes the most important thing for us to chat about. The possibilities are really endless.

-

TL;DR: We need users other than me uploading their own images to the bot to more equitably represent our broad interests. This was always intended to be the case, but only after this discussion did we realize that by failing to do this, there can be negative effects as well as the positive ones the bot creates in chat for some users

I've already had a couple users express interest in adding their own images in chat. I will upload a guide to meta shortly on how to do this. Other users interested in doing this are definitely encouraged to do so. 

As much as I would like to solve this on my own, it simply isn't possible. The fundamental problem is that the bot isn't representing people's interests, and so those people whose interests differ from mine need to go to some effort as well to get them represented by the bot. I realize that means some work, but this is a community undertaking, and a single person is not a community.



In all of this, the unifying theme is that the bot really does have to be a community task. It can't be just me adding and managing images. It was originally created to be something for everyone in the community to both add to and post from, but somehow that didn't happen. There was a strong consensus among community members that we wanted a bot like this, but no one besides me really wanted to put much work into it.

If the community isn't willing to take this up any more, then maybe we really don't need the bot any more. Sure, I might leave chat if that happens since I'd have little more reason to stick around, and some other users might be sad. It may also kill a lot of discussion that we currently have about the stuff it posts. But all of those are potentially acceptable if the bot is creating an atmosphere where a lot of serious anime fans on the main site feel under-represented and not particularly welcome.

On the other hand, if the community is willing to step up and add images and moderate the bot, I think it will be one of the most unique and engaging features in our chat and keep everyone interested. Right now it's having a positive effect for some people like me, but not everyone, and that isn't good. But it really doesn't take any major changes to the bot itself to make things good for everyone; it just takes people putting in a bit more effort to make the bot their own.

There is some useful info here about the bot, but I think a definitive meta post about the functionality would be very useful. Ideally linked in the bot's profile description for the long term.
I think most users only know that the bot exists, rather than the fact that it's community-editable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon Could you maybe tell us what you do and don't agree with? As it is right now, your statement doesn't really help.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko Could you maybe tell us what you do and don't agree with?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ton.yeung I somewhat agree with his proposals, but not his rationale. I left out debating them because it's unimportant to the main point - and I'm of the opinion that these kind of debates have no conclusions. 

For example, I think the point of Joel's talk is more about excluding non-knowledgable users, rather than excluding users who don't fit the homogeneous profile of the current community. The bot's function is more of the latter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also think that if content is in anyway in question of being nsfw, it should probably be categorized as such - bearing in mind that the bot is somewhat a representation of the community rather than a single user.

EDIT: As you can see, I think it's easy to get dragged into nitpicking - I'd prefer the conversation remain focussedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko Its important that we know you at least agree with the solutions, if not the reasoning behind them. From your comments before, I wasn't sure if you were half agreeing with one point or another, or the solution but not the rationale, or the rationale but not the solution, you see where I'm coming from?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ton.yeung yep - makes sense. Sorry, I probably presumed that somehow you could read my mindb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ton.yeung: I more of just had the inexplicable sense that something was amiss with the way the rationale was presented (e.g. with the exclusionary aspect of site culture, or with the male/female divide in anime), but I pretty much agree with why these things might be problems, or about what solutions could be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon do you mean to say that don't think the exclusionary aspect of the site culture applies here and that you don't think there is a male/female divide in anime? I'm just trying to clarify things and make sure decisions aren't made based off of conjecture or assumptions about what other people are saying.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My suggestion would be to take a neutral library to start with, like pictures of main characters of shows, covers, etc and then people could add their own. A lot of people are sexist and like cute stuff or fan-service. This is a problem not restricted to manga or anime, but in most popular art. Therefore these pictures will unavoidably be added. Adding cute pictures, is objectifying regardless of gender, so I think the question should be more general. In general is sexism and objectification really on-topic on this SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we not flag [such questions](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19540/whats-up-with-namis-breast-size) as inappropriate? Because if they are on-topic then they should be allowed in the chat and in the bot as well and if we leave the library solely to the interest of the community, the same problem will arise again. You yourself mentioned that you wouldn't be bothered looking for more general stuff, in which you aren't personally interested in, so why would others start caring, if we don't ourselves?


















Name: Ayama

Reasoning: Taken from the first kana of each word in the Japanese translation of "Anime and Manga" (アニメやまんが -> アやま -> Ayama). It's short, easy to remember, and unique to us.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's worth pointing out that this can be written as 謝, 誤, or 過, meaning (respectively) "apology", "mistake", and "error" (though there are more neutral ways to write it as well such as 逢山, meaning "rendezvous mountain").b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Yes, though usually it would have okurigana (る, り, つ, ち, etc.) after it. I can't think of a context where you'd ever see any of those three symbols written alone. (Though in pronunciation you are correct. Japanese is full of puns.)


















We've talked about this for a while, but we've never done anything about it... so let's do this now. Let's talk about what we should do with image id-requests that can be easily found via reverse image search.

What constitutes as "easily" reverse image searchable? There's various ways of going about it... you can use: https://www.google.com/imghp?sbi=1Google, http://tineye.com/Tineye, http://saucenao.com/SauceNao, or http://iqdb.org/iqdb.

I want to propose that if it's explicitly clear on at least the first page of a  Google reverse image search who someone is or what series it's from, it should be marked as off-topic (probably bundled in with our bad id-req reason).

I don't think we should be bothered with these kinds of trivial id-reqs, nor do I think they should take up space on our front page.

What say you community? Should we put the hammer down on these simple image id-reqs?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey! Let's talk about those image id-request we all know and love so muchb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was planning on asking a similar question, but yours covers most of the points. Instead of posting an answer with some thoughts I'd like to add, I'll leave them in comments (hoping they still get visibility). I generally think these should be treated as regular id-reqs. In fact, [our current guidelines](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/892) also cover id-reqs that provide images as _one_ of the criteria provided. If the minimum criteria requirement is not met, ***the question should be closed***.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm just unsure as to whether or not this should also be the case when the question has found an answer in the meantime (e.g. [1](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21445), [2](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21056)). Granted, there are some id-req questions that are not easily found by reverse search, and that could really use our help ([e.g.](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21092)). But these should also probably be closed and we should ask the OP to add some more details, such as what they already did to try to find an answer to it and whatnot, and then can possibly be reopened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All this closing brings about an undesirable side-effect: the front-page not only being filed with crappy id-reqs, but with crappy _closed_ id-reqs. Deleting them seems unfair, and defeats the purpose of having questions put _on-hold_ rather than being closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which brings me to the second point I'd like to bring up: people seem to be afraid (or something else, IDK) of down-voting crappy questions. There are some posts with discrepancies in the number of votes the question and the answer get (the answer getting more votes, and generally up-votes, I mean), which means some users bother to vote in answers but not in questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Down-voting the questions would get them off the front-page, and still allow the OP to edit some stuff in allowing the questions to be re-opened and possibly revert the voting trend. So basically I'd like to encourage people to both vote-to-close and down-vote these questions (understanding these are two different things used for different purposes), and also to try to explain to the OP what's happening and what they can do to help salvage the post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Speaking for myself, when I first joined, I was reluctant to downvote questions because I felt it wasn't gracious to downvote people who came here for help and didn't know the SE system. Now that every second question is someone wanting to know the origin of some image when it was easily searchable, I have shed this compunction and downvote such questions freely, but I still sometimes upvote the answers if I feel the answerer put in some good work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, there's no problem in up-voting the answers (or even the questions, even if they are id-reqs) if you feel they deserve it. I'm just saying I feel most people refrain from down-voting content worthy of being down-voted for some reason I'm unaware of.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat In all honesty, have extra details on an image-based question *ever* helped you locate the origin of the image? I've answered quite a few of these, and I've *literally never* read any additional information like this. I honestly can't imagine how they would help at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM The user telling us where they've already searched and failed, or where they got the image could be of help. Other than that, there is actually probably very little extra details the user can provide, otherwise they'd probably be able to id it themselves, I guess.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat "Could be" is this speculation on your part, or has it actually helped you in the past? I've spent the past few months trying to figure out what people actually use to answer identification questions, and in the process realized that when there's an image, I neither use nor need anything else, nor would anything else be very helpful to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Speculation on my part, and hasn't helped me so far. Which doesn't mean I don't think it couldn't eventually help me (or others) in the future, but yeah, I get what you mean.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Basing policy after something that you haven't seen happen ever so far is ridiculous. The goal of making policy decisions on meta is to deal with a large majority of possible cases, not everything we'll ever encounter. In a large majority of cases so far, such details are useless, so it doesn't make any sense to make a policy requiring them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM My objective when I mentioned the OP adding some more info was just to not defeat the purpose of questions now being put on-hold rather than closed, meaning users are supposed to be able to improve them, and not take the closure as definitive. But you do bring up some good points, so I guess we can consider the "we should ask the OP to add some more details" part as crossed out. As for the rest of what I said, I think it still makes at least _some_ sense. I also find your answer below to be an extremely viable solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the record, I think banning particular types of identification requests amounts to putting lipstick on a pig. Image-only id-reqs are, I guess, the crappiest type of id-req, and getting rid of them would be an unmitigated good, but this is just a half-measure. Allowing some but not others does nothing to stem the tide of crud (we're at 25%-and-rising of all questions being id-reqs, with >= 40% of questions asked in each of the past eight fortnights being id-reqs).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see a good solution to this problem, but I'm afraid if we just downvote, we might end up like Programmers.SE, where every third question has negative votes. There's even [a post about it on their meta](http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/7239/there-are-way-more-negative-votes-in-the-top-50-questions-than-positive-time-to). I've never asked a question there, and when I have something that might be on-topic for Programmers, I try to recast it for SO or Code Review because I fear the reception I'll get on Programmers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Late to the party, and maybe tangential as well, but I'm still thinking how image-only id-reqs would help *future readers*, considering that I can't search it on Google, and I think there's only a small probability that other users also try to find it, other than browsing on this site directly, *unless it's very notable* (e.g. particular event, not a random image from random manga/anime). This is my PoV, if we try to follow SE's mission to be a repository of high-quality Q&A, not a personal helpdesk.

Neither!!



As usual, this poll presents a false dichotomy: Either we add a new off-topic close reason or we do nothing. Neither of these is an optimal solution. 

The best option (as I explained in more detail https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2321here) is to realize that the real problem with these questions is that they're all abstract duplicates; it's a volume problem rather than a content problem. This calls for a canonical question and answer and closing future questions as duplicates of that when they're trivially answerable by reverse image search. 

This will allow the remaining non-trivial questions to remain answerable and be easier to follow for both experts and new users than some abstract meta policy that requires one to check several completely different sites to even know if the question is on-topic.

Of course, changes can be made as necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to be clear: Are you proposing closing *all* image ID-reqs as dupes, or just those that can be easily found via reverse image search?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア Only those which can be found easily via reverse image search. (As best I can tell, the "yes" answer also only applies to such images.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it's at all appropriate to close a question based on a deliberately false interpretation of the question. Someone asking where an image is from isn't asking how to do a reverse image search. (It's not even clear that the later question is even on topic for the main site.)  New users asking these questions aren't going to understand why their question was closed as a duplicate. They aren't going to buy this "abstract duplicate" nonsense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge These days on SE, "exact duplicate" is often used for questions where the answer to one also answers another even when the questions are superficially different. Canonical questions and answers are very much the norm on large sites when a specific variety of question is asked repeatedly and can always be answered the same way every time. We're far from the only site to do it (in fact, I'd argue we're doing too little of this), and so far it's only rarely caused confusion on other sites, which was usually easily alleviated by a couple comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Except these questions are substantially different and can't be correctly answered the same way, not without deliberately choosing to misinterpret them. The problem with these questions is that they're of low quality, not that they are all the same.


















How to add images to Taisho's list of unposted pictures:


Find an album of nice anime-related images. They must not break any SE rules like containing nudity and such. Preferably high resolution and quality. Just be sensible.
Upload those images on a reliable hosting and get direct links to them. Imgur is one valid choice.
Put all direct links to the images separated by new line into a .txt file or an online text hosting site like Pastebin. An example of text file contents:

http://i.imgur.com/VHllhiu.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/wWGuSnK.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/2QvNewu.png

Get link to the .txt file or raw version of online text hosting. If it's on Hastebin, it should look like this: http://hastebin.com/raw/asdfasdqwer.
Add images to Taisho like shown in these examples:

#post add http://example.com/images.txt
#post add http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=_7a12H0_
#post add http://hastebin.com/raw/asdfasdqwer

(Optional) If you wish to add images with specific tags, add tag name after the link (separated by a space) like so:

#post add http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=_7a12H0_ sometag


More on the image tags can be found in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2362/191this post.

When I get an answer that seems correct, I accept it, whether it has been days or just a few minutes. But it made me wonder. Should I leave the question open for a bit longer, to encourage others to come in and read the question? Is there a general best practice that could be followed or wouldn't it matter too much?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do accepted answers prevent people from giving more answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not like you can't accept a different answer if a better one pops up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, when a question has an accepted answer, I feel slightly discouraged to answer the question, unless I have **a lot more** to add to the questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron: It's a problem when the user is not going to stick to the site for a long time, and especially for questions which touches on aspects not yet revealed in the story. (Generally speaking)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron That's true, but also not germane to the question - the question is whether accepting answers reduces the number of answers posted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh your comment and the number of upvotes it has pretty much answer my question. So i guess from now on I'll give it some time before accepting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I get you, and I generally feel the same. But do you not refrain from creating new answers if you have little to add _even if there's no accepted answer_?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat: When there is little to add, I generally don't add a new answer, regardless of accepted answer/number of votes. If there is somewhat substantial information, and the question doesn't have accepted answer, then it's an interesting case. I currently can't recall having been in such cases, since it doesn't make me fired up, speaking from my experience on Anime.SE.


















I get your concern — accepting an answer can sometimes drive users with good (or better) answers away from answering the question. I've refrained from accepting answers myself once or twice too (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/778/did-jiraiya-meet-naruto-by-chance#comment3854_778here and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14577/was-there-an-animation-mistake-between-317-and-419-in-the-second-episode#comment27744_20553here, for instance), but in these instances my main reason for not accepting answers was actually that neither of the ones posted really made me feel like the questions were completely answered, so I felt shouldn't just accept the best "good enough" answer.


  Is there a general best practice that could be followed or wouldn't it matter too much?


There really isn't a best practice to follow. Accepting answers, much like voting, is completely up to the individual. Accepting an answer is — in sites that use the SO model but really don't have questions about solving problems — the closest thing to saying "Thank you! This answer was helpful (and answers my question, of course)". If you feel an answer fully addresses the question(s) you posed, feel free to accept it — or not! Nothing prevents you from retracting the vote at a later time if new answers come in, or to just leave the answers unaccepted and wait for other answers. And aside from that, you can always https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/bountystart a bounty if you feel better answers are out there.

Now, for some numbers to try to help better visualise the situation:  


We have 5,346 questions on our site;
Of which https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/3136482,900 have an accepted answer (meaning about 54% of the questions have accepted answers);
Of which https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/313653446 distinct questions (about 15% of the above) have received new answers after having cast (and not retracted) their most recent accept vote. To be more precise, there were https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/313448/has-question-received-any-answers-after-having-accepted-oneat least 748 answers posted to questions where the most recent accept vote was not retracted after that accept vote was cast (which means that the 446 questions I mentioned before have an average of 1,67 answers);
I estimate that up to 20% of the questions with accepted answers have received new answers after having accepted an answer. The query I link to above does not account for all of the cases, since the data available does not give us the precise time an answer was accepted (you can read more about it in the description of the query, and in the comments throughout it). As such, I've only accounted for answers that were posted in the day after an answer was accepted. This leaves out answers like https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/21437/49this one (picked just because it's a recent case that was still clear in my mind) that were posted in the same day the answer was accepted. It also does not account for cases in which the accept vote was changed (like https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/55/49here, in which my answer had been accepted at one point, and then new answers came in, and the accept vote was changed).


These numbers help you get a better understanding of the situation, but we obviously have no way of knowing if the other 80%-85% of questions that have not had new answers posted since an answer was accepted have not had them because of the accepted answer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causationcorrelation does not imply causation). It could be that other users thought the question was indeed answered, and they could add nothing new, regardless of the fact that there was an accepted answer. However, the numbers illustrate that there have been a lot of new answers posted in questions with accepted answers. 

Bottom line: accept an answer if you feel it fully addresses the questions posed. Or don't, if you feel something better is out there.



EDIT 

The above numbers are based on public queries, because I had decided it's be useful for other users to be able to access the queries and potentially contribute with more feedback or smarter ways of getting more accurate numbers or whatever. Nevertheless, I remembered I can also run this query on data that's not publicly accessible, if I just give the community the numbers I get from it. As such, I reran the above queries to give some more accurate numbers, and the results are as follows (note that some numbers have, naturally, changed; but I'll keep the old numbers above for reference):


We have 5,599 questions on our site (that's an increase of 253 since the day I posted this);
Of which 3,017 have an accepted answer (meaning about 54% of the questions have answers; same as above [which now shows 3,002, an increase of 102]); 
Of which 510 distinct questions (about 17% of the above; meaning 2% more than the above [which now shows 465, an increase of 19]) have received new answers after having cast (and not retracted) their most recent accept vote. To be more precise, there were 847 answers (that's 99 more than the above [which now shows 788, an increase of 40]) posted to questions where the most recent accept vote was not retracted after that accept vote was cast (which means that the 510 questions I mentioned have an average of 1.66 answers; a decrease of 0.1 when compared to the above numbers). Both of these numbers are regarding questions that have not changed their accept vote after the answer(s) was posted and disregard answers that were posted after the accept vote was cast but were afterwards deleted (as I had a quick look at the results and figured most of these were low-q or spam, so not worth keeping around [if they were taken into account the numbers would be 744 and 1483 respectively]). This point addresses the main focus of the question, in the way that it shows that 17% of the questions with accepted answers receive 1.66 new answers posted after their most recent accept vote was cast (and that vote was not retracted);
From this point on, I'm introducing new data that I wasn't able to get in the queries from before the edit (some of the above data is also new, and the numbers are significantly different). There are 302 answers that have had their accept vote retracted at some point (either because it was changed to another answer [more precise numbers for this below], because it was simply retracted to leave the question unanswered, or replaced on the same answer because the user was testing the buttons or something of the sort);  
There are 70 questions that had their accepted answer changed to another answer that was posted after the first answer had been accepted, and these got 116 answers that were posted after that vote was changed. If my head is not starting to malfunction, these 70 can be added to the above 510, to get a total count of 580 question that got new answers after they had accepted other answers, of which 12% where actually changed to the new answer. This means just a little over 2% of the questions with accepted answers have actually changed their accept vote to an answer posted after the accept vote had been cast.


So the bottom line here (in terms of numbers, and not in terms of what you should do) is that 54% of our questions have accepted answers, and 19% of these have had new answers posted since another answer was accepted, and just a little over 2% have changed their answer to one of those new answers. A total of 963 answers have been posted after an answer had been accepted, which means 12.6% of our answers were posted after another answer had been accepted on the question in which they were posted.

Anyone can correct my numbers if any math is wrong, or you can always ask for some more numbers that are not publicly accessible (I should have no problem in getting them to you, as long as they are not numbers that will allow you to get to identify users and so on) if you'd like to do some more research on these matters of answer acceptance and posting behaviours. I also have to add that SQL is not my _forte_, but I think every number given by the queries corresponds to the actual numbers I was aiming for.


















The question https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21592/99How is Armament Haki obtained or learned? is closed as primarily opinion based, because of an incorrect assumption that primarily opinion based means "we don't know the answer yet". 

Based on https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/307/99this meta post, questions whose answers are not yet revealed should be left open. Hence, I request that the question be reopened. 

As I mention in the comments, there is a realistic chance of the answer being revealed in the future. A flashback showing Luffy's training at Rusukaina is one such possibility. 

Note: In case anyone is wondering why I voted to close and then mention here that the reason is incorrect, that's because of the SE limitation of not being able to cast a reopen vote until the question is closed.

This is a trend I've noticed that's been going on for quite a while. Whenever someone asks a question on meta, it seems appropriate to answer with two possibilities (or more) and have the community vote on those. It's not.

Ask your question, and let people come up with their ideas. Don't create a poll, because that implies there are only two options.

If you don't get answers on your post, that's a different matter. But please, don't self-answer with N possibilities just to get votes on them. Meta is about discussion, and people have opinions different than yours, not everything is yes/no or a/b/c.

I agree. Allow me to quote from http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00005/Robert Cartaino♦'s https://lifehacks.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1343/how-medical-is-too-medical/1350#comment1969_1343comment on Meta LifeHacks.SE:

Sure - as the moderator who reopened the question, let me elaborate on what I believe the current consensus is. This is not a statement of site policy, but rather my take on how we currently do things.



I think that the current consensus is to accept questions on not just anime and manga, but also things that are part of the larger "otaku" industry/community, which I think uncontroversially includes (e.g.) light novels and visual novels, and perhaps-controversially includes things like Vocaloid; games in the style of KanColle and Girlfriend Beta; whatever Love Live was when it was first created (a "multimedia project", I guess?); and so forth. 

I offer as evidence the following:


We have lots of questions about visual novels without anime/manga counterparts.
We have questions about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/touhou-projectTouhou, which is, at its core, a series of self-produced video games. Despite there having apparently been a few official manga (I don't really follow Touhou), most of the questions are not specifically about those things.
We had https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9603/is-there-a-naming-scheme-for-the-abyssal-shipsa question about Kantai Collection that is more about the game than anything.
We had https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9627/where-can-i-watch-the-shuuen-no-shiori-bookmark-of-demise-music-videosa question about the Shuuen no Shiori song series, and I would be surprised if there were opposition to other questions about Vocaloid song series that lack anime/manga counterparts. (For example, if we had had a question about Kagerou Project back when it was still just a song series, I'm pretty confident we would have been fine with it.)
We even had https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19509/why-is-miku-shown-with-a-leekthis recent question about Hatsune Miku herself.
We have a fair number of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/amvquestions about AMVs, which seem to me to be even one step further divorced from the core of the "otaku" community than things like Vocaloid. 


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21705/what-is-the-background-story-of-hatsune-mikuThe particular Miku question under discussion is, admittedly, going to turn out to have a silly answer ("no, Miku lacks any explicit characterization outside the domain of fanworks"), but I think it's still a legitimate question insofar as Hatsune Miku is clearly part of the anime-o-sphere.

Or, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the boundary between what is core enough to the anime industry as to be on-topic and what isn't lies somewhere beyond Vocaloid. (I can't really think of any topics that would be borderline, unfortunately, so I'm not sure how to articulate where the cutoff ought to be.)

(In closing, I would like to point out that we apparently don't object to questions about AtLA and RWBY, which aren't even peripherally anime-related.)

(My point is: what does it being Japanese-dubbed or being drawn anime-style have to do with it?)


















Sometimes we will get questions about facts that have not been revealed yet. Some of them will most likely not even be revealed. These questions will pop up again from time to time and remain unanswered until the fact is finally revealed if that even happens. What should we do with such questions? The question came up, when I was thinking of a question which I know is not revealed yet. Though relevant, should I refrain from asking, or ask anyway, leaving it open until it is finally revealed?

I created a question about Fairy Tail Zero, thus tagged it appropriately and additionally tried to edit the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fairy-tail-zerofairy-tail-zero tag, adding some information. But as I was adding the information, all I could really do is link to Fairy Tail's main sites. So this made me wonder whether it really needs its own tag and more general, whether spin-offs should have their own tag?

For questions which ask about when a specific event happens, pointing out the anime episode number or the manga chapter number adequately answers the question. Is that sufficient, or is it also mandatory to post screenshots?

Definitely not. However, sometimes screenshots can help the asker visually confirm the accuracy of the answer. For example - answering an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question with an image of a character they remember

I do think the community likes putting images into answers, so it may seem like they're compulsory, but they certainly aren't.



On a side note, there's been lots of studies that blog posts and such keep readers attention longer if images are included to break the content up. So, I think there's probably a small correlation between getting upvoted more on your answers (because they're more often fully read) and having including images.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My most-upvoted question and answer, which are both http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/13076/7579, are also the ones with the most pictures in them.


















I mean are they on-topic, off-topic or what?
This https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/is-animation-or-comics-inspired-by-japanese-culture-or-styles-considered-on-topimeta question seems to suggest Avatar: The Last Airbender (A:TLA), The Legend of Korra (TLoK), RWBY, etc. are off-topic on this site.
However, I notice that A:TLA is discussed in the following questions:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19886/things-that-boost-different-bender-skillsThings that boost different bender skills
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19887/is-aang-also-boosted-by-the-cometIs Aang also boosted by the comet?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4973/who-was-the-first-avatarWho was the first avatar?

Btw, several episodes of TLoK and A:TLA were animated by Japanese, Japanese-collaborating and South Korean companies according to these links:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_episodeshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_episodes

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Mirhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Mir
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierrot_(company)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierrot_(company)

Is that relevant?

Note: My question is not asking whether A:TLA, TLoK or RWBY are considered "anime". Obviously, they are American television shows. However, they are drawn anime style and thus may be of interest to people who watch anime.

Edit: A tweeted question is closed as duplicate. Interesting...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does A&M SE already have a rule about anime-style fiction?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay fine. I will expand acronyms in the future. Sorry for any confusion I caused or would have caused. Thanks @JNatb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You don't need to expand them every time, but the first time you mention a series it's simpler to write it in full. Subsequent mentions of the series can be abbreviated. _I_ had to google those :P (doesn't mean everyone else who came here did too, but that way we just avoid an unnecessary search)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Indeed. Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @nhahtdh !b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree we're not very clear on this. I'm fine allowing things which are also anime-styled (since we allow questions about *doujinshi* and fan art which may not be made by Japanese people), but we need a set policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア Thanks...ki-ru-a?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/830/is-rwby-on-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin So the current policy is "Let's see" ? http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/840/4484b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think my question a few days ago falls under the same umbrella - http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2373/what-is-our-current-stance-on-questions-about-peripheral-anime-topicsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko This question is sufficiently different, IMO. Avatar/RWBY/etc are a qualitatively different type of "non-anime thing" than Touhou/Miku/etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin that question was about 'peripheral anime topics' rather than just those particular series - personally I'd slot these under that heading too - I don't think they're as separate as you make outb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it's weird for something like Avatar to appear on this website. They really tried to give it an eastern influence (even all the text that appears is Japanese). But there are already tons of Avatar questions over at the Science Fiction & Fantasy SE. To have them appear in both places just feels redundant.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@CodedMonkey You mean [Chinese](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Writing_in_the_World_of_Avatar) ?


















When I was looking at https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21804/2604this question, I noticed some votes to close it as per the consensus reached https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2359/hey-lets-talk-about-those-image-id-request-we-all-know-and-love-so-muchhere. I didn't have SafeSearch turned on, but in any case, I failed to get any useful results from the Google Reverse Image Search. iqdb, which does not appear to filter for sexually explicit material, produced a similar lack of promising results.

However, other users reported getting fairly useful results. I have also seen this happen with other questions, where my reverse image search attempts failed, but those of others did not.

In this case, what should be done? While to some users, the question is "trivially solvable", to others (including, perhaps, the OP), it may not be. I can see a motivation for closing such questions as duplicates anyway, but it seems ambiguous enough to me that it seemed worth asking on Meta.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should be done about image search requests that may not be trivially resolvable to a fraction of users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also get no results for this image.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also note that both current close votes on that question are for "off-topic", not as a duplicate of the reverse image tutorial, so strictly speaking this is an orthogonal issue to that. But I agree some clarification of what "trivial" means is in order.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM: Oops, I must have failed to check properly, but either way, a discussion of trivialness seems relevant, as you've pointed out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do get results. 14 to be exact. 12 videos of the scene it was from (all on different porn sites) and 2 links to this SE question. I had to scroll through the movie and google some keyword to find that it was *La Blue Girl*, so I did find it within a minute, but not sure whether this would have been a duplicate of that. I guess google searches are relevant to your cookies and settings and that it might not actually be a duplicate of that question at all time?


















The https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2359/hey-lets-talk-about-those-image-id-request-we-all-know-and-love-so-muchrecent consensus is to close all trivially reverse searchable image identification request questions as duplicate of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618/how-can-i-identify-the-source-of-an-anime-image-using-reverse-image-searchthis question.

However, since the question closed as duplicate can't be viewed by general public (they are redirected to the target question), is there any use in keeping these closed questions in the long run?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any worth in keeping questions closed as duplicate to the Reverse Image Search post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My opinion was that they should be downvoted & then deleted, but that didn't seem to be a popular opinion. Can we delete closed questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko: Yes, but even for max privilege user, you need to wait for 2 days if the question's score is more than -3.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I actually haven't thought of that aspect. The duplicate feature works against us in this instance. Needs more thinking.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Too me it feels like this rule is relevant to this post and should just be answered and downvoted as any other question that showed only little effort from OP: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/249/6166


















I'll admit that I was wrong about something when I proposed this. I had thought that the Roomba would delete these questions if they were downvoted and unanswered. However, it seems the Roomba does not delete questions marked as duplicates. So yes, if we follow this policy and don't put any effort into deleting the questions, we'll be left with a large number of posts which are duplicates of the tutorial.

Your question is "is there any use in keeping these?" and to that I think the answer is usually "not really". The questions don't contain any interesting new details. They might sometimes be useful for search engine optimization, and logged out users will immediately be redirected to the duplicate target. However, this is a rather rare case and hard to predict. They also might occasionally gain a bit of rep for the asker or an answerer, but that's not a big concern. There's also a rare case where the OP wants to find their question after leaving it for a while, which deleting would make harder, but that's quite uncommon if we wait for a few days before deleting.

On the other hand, we could also ask "is there any harm in keeping these?" and I think the answer again is usually "not really". If a user is insistently editing a question to get it bumped to the front page or flagging it to try to get it reopened, that might be a problem. But most of these are going to silently drop off the main page and then be basically invisible. It's unlikely they'll get a lot of activity, especially since logged out users will be silently redirected to the tutorial question. So long as the question isn't getting any views or activity, it's just sort of there, and doesn't really do much other than occasionally help with SEO for the tutorial.

So, in the end, I think there's little to gain or lose from deleting these questions. I don't think it's worth the effort to go through every time, but I also don't think it would hurt much if these questions do get deleted. I personally don't think it's worth putting in the extra effort to do this (it increases the number of required votes to deal with the question from 5 to 8 and only has a visible effect for logged in users who manage to find the question), so I wouldn't bother. But if other users perceive a real cost in keeping such questions around, I think there's little harm in deleting most of them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, now that I'm looking into it, it looks like only the 9-day cleanup procedure would be affected by duplicate status. The 30-day and 365-day ones would seem to still work even if the post is marked as a duplicate, so long as it isn't answered and has a sufficiently low score. If that is the case, I see even less reason to bother with the extra work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But if it is a trivial search, they tend to receive a answer quite rapidly. Won't that harm the clean up ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the end, what was the consensus here? Is there any worth closing them as a duplicate, as technically speaking they are not a duplicate? The reason I ask is, because I have been voting against closing such questions as a duplicate and have downvoted them instead, but if the consensus says otherwise I'll stop doing so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves The consensus is to mark such questions as duplicates. That was decided at http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2359. This question is more about what we do after that, and I don't see a strong consensus either way, but my answer says that it probably isn't worth the effort to individually delete all of these.


















So there are these questions:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/464/if-theres-only-one-of-each-fruit-how-could-blackbeard-recognize-the-dark-darkIf there's only one of each fruit, how could Blackbeard recognize the "Dark Dark" fruit?

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5919/how-is-the-ability-of-a-devil-fruit-discovered?rq=1How is the ability of a Devil Fruit discovered?

These questions are duplicates, so I flagged the newer question as a duplicate of the older. Though the newer question has a much better and more relevant answer, so in this specific case, should it be flagged the other way around, since we actually want more traffic to the more relevant/better answer?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is more important when flagging as duplicate? Time or content?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While there is some overlap, I don't believe the two questions are *exact* duplicates. One focuses more on a particular character and how he found a particular fruit, while the other is a general question about how the ability a fruit is identified. Currently a cannot answer cannot be given for either, as neither of the accounts have be chronicled or illustrated in anyway by the author.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Masked Man's is a pretty correct cannon answer though. Spandam, Sanji and Blackbeard all mentioned an illustrated book on Devil Fruits, which is how people would know the characteristics and power from. If not recorded yet, someone has to be the first to try.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ About the fact whether they are duplicates. The first question does not ask about how it was found. The answer states this, but the question never asked for it. The question was "how did he recognize the Dark Fruit". Which is a superset of the question "How do you know what power beholds a certain fruit" and that is answered by Masked Man. From the wiki: "There is a book in the Grand Line with Devil Fruits listed. The most notable example is Blackbeard, who, in his search for the Yami Yami no Mi, catalogs a book which was also mentioned by Spandam and Sanji."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe that the former question with Blackbeard could possible a different chronicle account than a generalized method of identification of devil fruits. For an example, what if Blackbeard came about some secret documents chronicling knowledge of certain Devil Fruits, possibly from the Void Century? This could be different than say an updated encyclopedia maintained by the Marines or some third-party about known Devil Fruits. The answers to both might be one and the same, but until the facts are clear, I don't think we should discount one over the other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ I see. That makes sense. But to go back to the question. Suppose these were duplicates. What should be linked as the original question? The oldest one or the one with the better answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the end results were clearly the exact duplicate, then I would personally mark the one without a clear answer as the duplicate. If both questions had answers (but none of the definitive), then I would first take a look at the quality of the question and then merge the answers into from the question that is of a lesser quality into the better one. If the quality of both question were the same then I would probably say the older one gets preference.


















Time flies while we're having fun, did you know? We almost two and a half years old.

We https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/what-should-our-site-design-look-likehad a discussion in late 2013 on the topic, but I think now is a good time for us to ponder again about our site design, now that we finally started to settle in a bit more users. What would you like to see in our site design?

For now let's try to keep things simple. 

If we were to graduate, we would have at least something (but not limited) like the following:


A super cool new banner (it's been mentioned that we can get an artist do a commision for our banner)
A fabulous new custom site design
Awesome icons for our badges 
A super exclusive icon for our community


But let's not stop there! Let's try to do something interesting and unique with our design. While the final decision is up to the folks at Stack Exchange, it doesn't hurt to try to dream a little bigger now does it?

What would be something interesting and unique you ask?


Maybe a css style that changes with the season or just with the times of day (UTC time). It bit like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P16hgLlnr-oGmail's "Tea House", but we needn't get as complicated (maybe just 3 different states, and not sun/moon tracking).
Maybe a Google Doodle type interactive banner for our main site? 
Maybe a special gimmick for our "Ask a Question" button
Maybe a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/848/sos-the-great-anime-se-mascot-idol-searchspecial mascot character we can "replace" the community bot with?


Whatever ideas you have in mind, not matter how krazy (or trivial) it may seem, we'd like to hear it.

As some of you may or may not know, on the site we have a small social media (unofficial, i.e., unaffliated with ) community for promoting our site on http://fbl.me/animeseFacebook and http://goo.gl/jcdBXFGoogle+. For that community we adopted https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/426/what-should-our-unofficial-community-name-and-logo-or-mascot-bea logo that we used to cross promote our site. 

Before you go off on your own trying to make things, note that this is simply an information gathering session to get a better idea of what you'd like to see our site as once it's graduated. Try to keep things simple, but not too abstract. Any concept art and sketches are welcome nonetheless.

Some points (all optional) to consider writing about are:


What is the first thing you want users to see when they visit out site?


What should the color scheme be like?
What subject do you want the cool banner to be of?

What do you want our badge icons to look like? (Try to keep the design simple something too detailed might not transfer over well when shrunken down)
What about other icons and element? (E.g., for our answered question element theme, we can have it looks like a stamped signature, like how https://i.stack.imgur.com/reSI3.pngYahoo Japan Chiebukuro does for their Q&A site)
Notes or comments on a logo design or color scheme
Should we have a mascot? If so, if not, why?
Any other points you wish to discuss (e.g., special theme for our chat room)


Let us know what you'd like to see when we graduate! Remember! Only with our combined efforts as a community can we truly grow. I look forward to hearing about what you guys have in mind for our site and community.

Some Personal Remarks: I don't think we should stick with a particular anime or manga as part of the theme, unless we can get a well-known (or decently renowned) manga/anime artist or illustrator to do a comission centerpiece for our site. Something like that would be a nice to have, but we'd probably need to get in contact with them to see if they are willing and have availability. It's something I'd like to do if possible, but that ultimately is a discussion for another time. Maybe we can find someone on Pixiv if we can't get a real pro to do it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey! Listen! Let's have a talk about our site design! (The Idea Gathering 2015 Edition)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/6697?m=21783013#21783013b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whatever the design, I request lolis. Not candies, lolis. ^,…,^


















Few of my suggestions:


Season based design will not look global, as you might know all of us are not from same region. Different region different weather and season and applying UTC means ignoring most of all users.
I think we should use few elements from famous anime/manga Like pokeball for badges or some Naruto clan symbol for badges.
I think it will look good if we do fusion of black and white with colour to represent manga and anime both.
Mascot, why not. It will looks cool and I don't thing anime and manga site should be dull at all. It should be cheerful.
Some made for site manga comic page for bottom with our own mascot.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By seasons I would say we follow the anime seasons in Japan. It might be exclusive but it's exclusive to anime and manga in Japan, which is related to the topic of the siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ i don't think SE will going to make multiple designs for a single site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They might not, but it doesn't hurt to ask.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I second the concern about season-based design (unless it were optional in account settings, so some users could opt to see a simple/plain layout similar to the current one, some could choose summer, and some could choose winter, based on their location on the globe). Ideally, SE would be frequented by people from many nations, and they ought not be off-put by a northern hemisphere-centric design just because Japan is north of the equator.


















As some of you may or may not know, on the site we have a small social media (unofficial, i.e., unaffliated with Stack Exchange) community for promoting our site on http://fbl.me/animeseFacebook and http://goo.gl/jcdBXFGoogle+. The purpose of the site is to promote attention to our main site.

On the social sites occasionally feature good answered (#mondainai) and unanswered questions (#mondaiaru) on our site. It's like to do a community based event and extended it to all questions and answers.

I'd like to create a monthly event for users to participate where they nominate a good question or answer that deserves more recognition or a question that should get more attention (it can be one with or without an accepted answer). A featured question or answer of the month, so to speak.

Sometimes good questions/answer get buried under the torrents of other question/answer and might not get the attention (or votes) they deserve. The idea is to not only bring to these types of questions and answers that users might have missed, but to also showcase what good question and answers looks like, so we can set a good example to newer users. 

The idea is to start voting a month beforehand, users can nominate a question, an answer or both. They would also be asked to add a brief blurb about they they nominated it. E.g. The accepted answer to this question is purely based or conjecture and cites no facts, I think a better answer can be given; The details of said answer to X question are out of date due to recent developments in Y media. Voting will be done is one meta. Featured question and answers will be noted and marked as they are posted. After voting concludes at the end of the month, a meta will be posted with the featured question and/or answer, and a brief explanation on why it was featured (e.g. very detailed answer, curious question, need more attention, etc).

This way question/answer the could use attention can be brought up more easily to other users who might not be aware. No action is required by the users, but they can in their own volition, vote as they wish, add a bounty to attract attention, etc.

The final format of such an event is still open for discussion. 

Would anyone be interested? If so, I would like to hear your thoughts and opinions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Event Proposal: Let's start doing a featured spotlight on good questions and questions that need attention on our main siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is brilliant! However, I would recommend if users are able to nominate _multiple_ posts (if they desire instead of one). This would broaden the impact this event has.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron I think they should be allowed to do this, as long as they propose one question or answer per nomination. Otherwise they can make as many or as little nomination as they would like. But ideally we would feature only one or two different types (at most) at a time, so we don't spread people's attentions too thin.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm also in favor of this. As we get more organized about it, we should compile a list of questions already featured. We could also involve bounties if someone steps forward to offer them. (For the unanswered ones, that is.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This would be a great, imaginative way to make sure good questions and answers get attention amid the torrential id reqs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5so basically a "bounty" of increased publicity?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Might as well throw a bounty on those as well.


















Technicalities on the mentioned question aside, if the end results of the answer were clearly the exact duplicates of one another, then I would mark the one without a clear answer as the duplicate. 

If both questions had answers (but none of them definitives answer the question), then I would first take a look at the quality of the question and then merge the answers into from the question that is of a lesser quality into the better one. 

If the quality of both question were the same then I would probably say the older one gets preference.

In short. if there is newer with the better answer (or any at all) it should get preference, otherwise the older question get the preference. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So for normal users, the appropriate way of action for the second case would be to flag for moderation instead of duplication?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves: Note that merging is rarely done, since it destroys the connection of the answers to the original question. Also, slight differences in the way the question is asked may result in extra content or discrepancies when merged.


















How about a new position for our stack logo?

All the SE (graduated) sites have their logo on top, either on the left side or in the middle.

But ours should be on the right side. Why?  Because mainly, it would give a manga-vibe and also, it will be certainly different.

It would be off-putting (and a bad UX decision) to most users, especially those who know little to no Japanese, to have the logo on the right, which is counter-intuitive and counter-productive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao point considered.


















Banner and custom site design

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/728What Eric came up with: iconic characters in a marching line like that in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3002ED of Carnival Phantasm. If not, then https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20115some character who is a combination of many from different series.

Icons for badges

Since the badges are divided into three categories: bronze, silver and gold, we may match icons of the three imperial regalia of Japan that appears everywhere in anime to the three class badges. It doesn't have to be the imperial regalia, anything that comes in threes and is representative of the anime & manga culture could work.

Site icon

I really like the look of the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/459mon of 画 and feel that it should appear somewhere on our community site. However, I can't tell by looking at the mon what subject it is supposed to represent. On the other hand, the current site icon with its kanji character 画 is pretty clear to me that it is about manga and anime†

Mascot

I don't think we should have a mascot, but I'm not opposed to having one if the mascot is overwhelmingly accepted by the community.

Tour page

If we ever get our customized Tour page, I wish we could have Chiyuki from Death Parade as our guide to familiarize new users to the SE Q&A model and go over the rules and functionality of our site in her own unique *-tsu ways. But, because of licensing issues, we probably can't have any visual or audio of the real Chiyuki.

Re some personal remarks

I put forward a candidate: VL, the creator of http://arancia-project.com/Arancia. I also think http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=2981えむかみ's art style is compatible with our needs for the site design.



† In Chinese, anime is written as 动画.

Anything that is an animated cartoon. 漫画 in Chinese (Mandarin) and 漫画 in Japanese are the same and mean about the same thing. Stories drawn in books. AKA comics (for the most part). Unless its different in Cantonese?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DodziDzakuma: I'm a Cantonese speaker (although my skills are a bit lacking), and that sounds about right to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DodziDzakuma Technically, you are right, 动画 means the same as the Japanese usage of the term *[anime](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/81/8486)*, which is animation. However, when we Chinese (especially those who watch Japanese anime) hear the term 动画, most people would assume you're talking about Japanese animation. Some sites make this more clear by adding the word "Japanese" or "Japanese/Korean" before 动画. We also have a loan word from/for cartoon: 卡通. If you still have questions, you should direct them to the [SE site](http://chinese.stackexchange.com/) dedicated to this topic.


















How about we do it ourselves again and write a userscript that overrides whatever site design we get if we think we can do better?

I'm not sure any site is getting a theme that changes several times a day or even with each of 4 seasons. But we could totally stick some pics together and make it happen with a custom style.

Not saying we should abandon this post, on the contrary, whatever SE team won't implement, we could do add on to their design. Or just ditch it and make our own if we don't like it!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I second this proposal. I, for one, don't like to have a poorly-designed or distracting theme shoved down my throat. This is more logical than having to install a custom theme to override the non-generic default theme.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I recommend Stylish for chrome for personalized css customizationsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well SE has to listen to us, at the end of the day its a community driven platform.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I mean is they're probably not gonna do anything too specific to avoid copyright stuff. Trying to do so they might come up with a design that looks too bland or generic for us, localers. Or the design would be suited at new users (which is completely fine btw and it's the way it should be) and not look too cool for us. In this case it would do more harm to try and change it than create a custom theme for those who want to use it.


















Woo! Party time!




  Maybe a css style that changes with the season or just with the times of day (UTC time). It bit like Gmail's "Tea House", but we needn't get as complicated (maybe just 3 different states, and not sun/moon tracking).


I absolutely love this idea. I think it would be really cool to have a banner with trees on it that would show the Sakura blooming in April, and the leaves turning yellow and red in fall. It would definitely show that our site is unique and just how awesome of a community we are! (You know, very colorful. Seewutididthar?)

At the same time, I wouldn't want to see it change daily or by time of day. I think that would just be too distracting.



As for some specifics:


What is the first thing you want users to see when they visit our site? - Anime. Our banner and site should reflect our chosen media. They should know they're on an anime site.
What should the color scheme be like? - See below.
What subject do you want the cool banner to be of? - This is where I'm not sure. Personally I'd like to see a detailed anime background, something like https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8JHaidj6UhEYWRZeDVmbi1oMjQ&authuser=0this, with characters in the foreground, both male and female. And of course, our mascot should be the most noticeable if we have one.
What do you want our badge icons to look like? - I like the idea of using candies for this. It's not anime-exclusive, but I think it goes well with the atmosphere we want to convey. (These are seen in designs below.)
What about other icons and element? - See below.
Notes or comments on a logo design or color scheme - I like the icon we've been using for the community sites, because it is very much like the stylized kanji that Japanese prefectures use on their flags, and uses a very fitting kanji at that. For more beyond the logo, see below.
Should we have a mascot? If so, if not, why? - Yes. What better way to represent an anime community than with an anime character?




With all this in mind, I put together a few designs last week. They're all pretty similar, but make varying degrees of changes. They use the site name "Ayama", which is one https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2358/274I came up with earlier. I think it fits better than trying to cram "Anime & Manga" into the banner.

Note that in the below designs, artwork from DeviantArt was used (http://fav.me/d7pgst8{1} http://fav.me/d5hbt5v{2}). These would be replaced with commissioned art in the final design.

Design 1

https://i.imgur.com/Fxio5yJ.png

Color scheme:



This was my first attempt. I attempted to use elements of anime in the banner, and manga for the main page, as sort of a complement to the (respective) visual, and textual components of the site. Some icons are close to, or identical to, the vanilla site, but notably there is the accepted stamp (similar to what Krazer suggested), the candy badges, and the site logo. It uses very muted tones to contrast elements like the anime characters as well as suit the tone of black-and-white manga without actually being monochromatic.

Design 2

https://i.imgur.com/rKEmoLA.png

Color scheme:



This design is very similar to #1, but tries to somewhat mimic the minimalist approach that Stack Exchange has been taking with their recent sites. 3D elements are reduced in z-distance and fonts and effects are simplified.

Design 3

https://i.imgur.com/uUh7a1Y.png

Color scheme:



In the vein of #2, I wanted to try seeing what our site would look like with more color (to reflect anime moreso than manga, but still represent both cultures). This uses a brighter color scheme and does away with the manga pages (though they could be re-added if we decided we wanted them with this scheme). It very much touches on Stack Exchange's latest design ideas, trying to use flat colors while still creating contrast between them (such as the brown-blue of the logo and title).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That is a bloody good post you've got there! I like Design 2 the most, but I prefer a modified version where reverse-vignetting is applied to the manga strips, which could be placed farther away from the main div/block in the middle. I'm not too fond of the candies...but keep up the awesome work! You have a talent for this and you've worked hard, so kudos to you!


















Okay, this is the 4th time I've written this answer and made these images because something kept going wrong, so I'm keeping it minimal and I'm not focussing on making it look pretty.

Overall Site Design:


I like @キルア's example of the manga panels running down the side. 


Some suggestions though.




I think we should stick with 'Anime & Manga' for our site name. There is definitely room for it and it's much easier to understand than Ayama - our user base is primarily English-speaking - Even I had to look up what the kanji was and what Ayama meant. I do like the petals inside the stylized version though - which is why I chose the flowered yahoo stamp
Black & White is pretty dull. I think it could work as a silhouette background on Meta, but not on the main site. By adding Yahoo's stamp and saturating it a bit, look how much more it pops out. 
The images that were included were nice, but they won't be the final version as they're someone else's characters. If we do go this route - and have a mascot - I think they should be featured up there instead.


Smaller Features


Sweets don't instantly scream Anime & Manga to the user. I would prefer something relatable - take for example @iklsr's shuriken on the previous suggestion: 




I'm not saying it has to be shuriken, It could be cherry blossom leaves or something else featured in anime a lot (and on a side note, they don't have to be gold-silver-bronze either - maybe the leaves could be gold,deep red,pink?


Again, I like @キルア's example of this https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/747/1530(in the previous question) - not those exact icons, but I can see this concept working, I just don't have enough artistic skills to demonstrate it :P




Mascot

I think most people support the idea of a mascot (although, choosing one is a different matter >_> ). I still think the mascot should have a surrounding theme of investigation - rather than one with some silly quirks, As it will integrate into the site smoother. I like @Gao's suggestion of having them explain the tour page (although I'm not sure how willing SE would be to do that :P). It doesn't necessarily have to be the mascot I proposed in the meta question, but I think they fit the theme & the site well.

Things to bear in mind


I think we should be careful of overlapping into purely Japanese imagery in case Japanese Language / Japanese Culture graduate.
I think we should be careful not to over-use the Manga Temple font.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With regard to the name, keep in mind that it's a form of branding and something to make us unique. Very few people know what "google" or "sankaku" actually mean; those that are curious about our name would just ask.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@キルア hmm, that's a valid point - but I think going along the lines of Gaming's "Arqade" which is instantly relatable is a better idea - just my personal opinion of courseb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't like shuriken for badges, but I do like your cherry blossom leaf idea. Not only are cherry blossoms Japanese and anime-related, they have some associations across genres. They've been used as symbols in anime as disparate as Clannad and Rurouni Kenshin. Shurikens, pokeballs, etc. are all associated with, at best, one single genre, and at worst with one single series.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@torisuda - that was one reservation I had about them also, I couldn't think of a better example though :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, it's a hard problem. Anime is really diverse and doesn't have many universal symbols or themes like other SEs have to work with. Movies and TV based their design on physical artifacts like film strips and popcorn buckets, and Sci Fi and Fantasy has a space and magic look that suits both the sci fi and fantasy genres, but I can't think of anything along those lines for us. That's why I'm just lurking and commenting instead of contributing my own ideas--because I haven't got any.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aye, it's difficult to pick a universal symbol - and also one that fits into a medal colour scheme - and one that scales small well. None of my ideas really fit. Anime eyes probably won't scale well, Yen coins aren't really anime - more Japan. Cherry blossoms are the only thing I could think of working that'd fit all the reqs. EDIT: small robots maybe


















I don't really know if this questions fits here or should go to chat but I'm really curious about this, I ask this in the Meta. 

What is going on with all these Death Note questions? 
People come up with all different of fictional events and ask if this or that scenario would work with the Death Note rules. It slightly starts to annoy me to be honest. I mean a suspicious mind could even wonder if people try to farm reputation with these, since there are a lot of rule and they are pretty strict and absolute and people try to somehow squeeze between the rules.  

Death Note is a great Anime! But it's also quite old by now so, is there a new Death Note hype I missed or where does this trend comes from?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's up with all these Death Note Questions lately?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure what more we can do than to speculate why. You can ask the question askers?...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, i makre this as a discussion since i'd liek to hear other opinions about it :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the reason why so many showed up recently. It's probably partly my fault. My *next tag badge* was [tag:Death-Note], so I went to look for unanswered *death-note* questions and seeing as there were quite a few, I started answering them. They aren't new, but as to whether they are all on-topic is another matter though. I'm quite sure this will even out again in a few days. Sorry about that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure why people ask them though as I personally only asked 3 of them, but if I'm honest then answering would have been for reputation farming as I have basically been trying to get the *mortarboard* and *death-note tag* badge the last two days. Again sorry about that, I'll not do so in the future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Btw related posts are [this](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/1099/6166) and [this](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/2282/6166)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves: I think there is nothing to be sorry about or refrain from doing here. The questions are on topic (as far as the cited meta discussions go), so it's not wrong to provide an answer to them. It's better than leaving them with unanswered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves that explains a lot :D TBH i didn't checked the date of these questions and ofc its better to answer them then leave them open, so pls don't stop to share your wisdom with us :D It was just really spooky to see this army of deathnote questions :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Honestly, the "identification request" questions are more irritating than the Death Note questions, (Disclaimer: I posted one of those recent Death Note questions.) but I see your point and you could do what I did with the "identification request" questions: add it to the ignored tags, then hide ignored tags in your profile.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, since this topic was raised, I want to point out that I am most certainly not farming reputation. I had been on a 17 month "hiatus" recently, and another 4 month "hiatus" not long before that one. My reputation is already **OVER 9000!!** and it could have been 20k+ easily. PS: By the way, please visit my profile and upvote some of my answers. ;-) Not too many at a time, it would get reversed for serial upvoting. :-Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's a trend, people saw how interesting the questions were, and then came up with concepts that "couldn't be beat" or to find a plot hole, I for one asked one in hopes of doing this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i'm not actually saying that peaple do it for farming rep, just that there is a possibility that people could read it that way :D perdefault i believe that everyone here acts nice :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ofc finding plot holes is funny but as in other meta post mentioned these questions always have a bit of speculation and opinion in them even in the  pretty accurate ruled world of death noteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be honest, I also get annoyed with all these academic "Can the Death Note kill somebody whose face was eaten off by rabid cuttlefish?" type questions too, but they are and should be on-topic. SciFi and Fantasy SE often fields questions that ask answerers to speculate within the established rules of a fictional universe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By the way, its a good thing you don't use your real name and real picture here. ;-)


















So we just got https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21936/6166the question of a parent, wanting to offer manga to its child, who seemingly showed interest. 

It made me look through the SE to find for a guide that would help a similar person where to start or how to start and I came across https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/156/6166this question (which I stole the question-title from btw). So it made me wonder whether we actually created such a recourse list? If so, where could it be found and if not, why did we not create such a list and whether it would still be relevant to make for cases as these?

Imagine you posted an answer, which at the time seemed good and got a few upvotes. Then a few months/years later you revisit your answer, read it and wonder how you could have ever come up with such rubbish. What would you do?

I have had this a couple of times recently and obviously the first thing I'd do is try to salvage the answer as much as possible, by editing it. But a few times it was just not salvageable, so I ctrl+a-ed the answer and rewrote it as a whole, resulting in a much better answer (based on upvotes of course, not being cocky or anything).

Is this rewriting of answers fair towards the earlier upvoters? Should I have just made a second answer instead?



I guess this question is related to this question:

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/457/6166Should questions that are unanswerable until later (unaired) episodes/chapters be allowed?

I recently read there, that when an unanswerable question is asked, it should be answered with the currently available knowledge. Then, later ...


  When the answer is finally revealed, the real answers will come without invalidating the existing answers. Furthermore, the existing answers will still be useful to people picking up the series late and don't want a full spoiler.


What if you yourself want to answer the same question again, but now with the newly available information? Should you create a second answer? Or should you edit your original answer?

I don't feel there is anything wrong with the author making such change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh That's problematic since anyone who upvoted or accepted the answer wanted to support the original answer, not necessarily the new edit you've made. (Another way to think about it: what if you changed it from correct, to wrong?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There was some discussion of a similar issue in the SO context in [this Meta Stack Overflow question](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/295422/3376926).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fun fact, a while ago on German Language, I posted an answer which gained upvotes (more than three) but then the experts arrived and proved me wrong in almost every detail. I decided to delete it and write another correct one later; did so, and it got more upvotes. Plus I earned the disciplined badge.

I see there https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/21/is-discussing-hentai-allowed?lq=1are https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/755/how-should-we-handle-potentially-nsfw-content-from-questions-and-answersposts on this meta regarding explicit content, and generally the answers say that it's allowed as long as there are no offending images or links to the material. However, while https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21921/what-anime-is-this-picture-of-a-woman-holding-the-face-of-a-mansome questions of this type are left open and answered as usual, I sometimes see https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21950/search-for-yaoi-mangasimilar questions being closed for the same reason.

Please clarify: Are these types of questions allowed or not?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is explicit content off topic or not?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, that closure seems to be inconsistent with the meta posts we've had - I've cast a reopen vote on it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That question is off-topic. The fact it was answered before getting closed doesn't make it any more on-topic. There is a very big difference between "potentially NSFW" and "Explicitly hentai"


















I'm going to be as clear as possible here, because it seems as though it's not, despite having to explain it on meta and on chat multiple occasions.

We've done extensive research with how other sites on the network handle explicit content. We've asked several staff members what's their personal opinion and what's the network's policy with regards to explicit content.


The Movies & TV community does not accept questions with regards to porn. Plot questions regarding movies which have sexual scenes in them are fine. Questions about porn are not.
The Arqade community does not accept questions with regards to porn games. Questions regarding games with mature content in them is fine. Questions about porn are not.


As for the very specific case of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions that resolve to hentai. We will not become a hentai search engine. We will not become a hentai identification service.

As for the official response from SE. There are plenty of posts by SE staff that apparently get silently ignored all over the network in metas.

Here's the most prominent one


  https://webapps.meta.stackexchange.com/a/367No, I don't think we want this, as it would cause us to get globally banned from web filtering software.
  So including adult links, or even mentioning adult sites by name, is explicitly not allowed.


To conclude:


Anything strictly hentai is off-topic. Ecchi is fine
Identification requests that are clearly about hentai (because the asker specifically asks for hentai) is off-topic. And editing to make it prettier doesn't make the question any less off-topic.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have put up an answer as a comment/reply to this answer. Should the mentioned requests have been closed as well?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does your answer exclude series containing explicit content in general (even if the question doesn't say anything about it)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh We don't close questions based on the answer. Just like we don't tag identification-requests with the series after it was answered. If the question asks for explicit materials (or a hentai), it is off-topic. If the answer happens to be hentai, we'll deal with that in some other way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha I'll continue here, as this will probably be read more. So how should we deal with questions that ended up asking for hentai in the end? We still want them off the site, won't we?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What do you mean by "questions that ended up asking for hentai in the end"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves: I personally feel that there is no reason to exclude them for the site. There are plenty of series with 18+ release that have been made into all age release. If people want to, they will obtain it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I think the point is that leaving such questions open on the site, might make people come into contact with hentai, even when they did not want to in the first place. There is still a difference between a regular 18+ movie and a porn movie.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If an ID request turned out to completely match a certain hentai work, and the answerer cannot mention its name because it may cause the site to get banned from google or whatever, that is an interesting situation. The answer is known, it cannot be posted. Perhaps a custom close reason would be in order for such cases?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey guys, I have a solution for this sticky situation where a question may not be explicit but an answer may be - let's get rid of identification requests! This is a solution (probably the _only_ solution) fully compatible with the goals of 1.) not having explicit material on the site; and 2.) not closing questions based on their answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin I wonder if making all id-requests will actually stop users from asking them. My first guess would be, that it wouldn't and they would just end up on the site regardless. So, what about flagging any hentai content as inappropriate instead? If the main goal is to avoid being globally banned for having inappropriate content, wouldn't it be better to just flag it as such? As the flag says *"A reasonable person would find this content inappropriate for respectful discourse."*, a reasonable person would indeed find hentai to be inappropriate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves Sure, we can do that, but if we want to do that _and_ we don't want to close questions based on their answers, we have a problem: if we have to flag and remove every answer to a hentai id-req, we're left with these zombie id-req questions floating around that cannot be answered, and yet we don't have a reason to close them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin Personally I am not against closing a question for its answer as was done [here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21950/6166) by Madara. If a question is asking for hentai, then once it is found out, the question should be flagged imho. And wouldn't deleting the question, also delete the answers subsequently?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did not know that flagging something abusive will result in a -100 rep penalty though, as mentioned [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/1014/6166). That's pretty harsh for something the asker might not have been aware off...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterRaeves yes, as you've discovered, red flags (abusive or spam) incur a -100 rep penalty. Also, it's the behavior of bad question asking I'd like to stop, not that of answering.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase: Currently, Madara still leaves them open, as long as the asker doesn't say "hentai", or describe sexual action.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a definitive way of deducing a work is hentai from an id request (if it doesn't explicitly say) ? Some of the existing closures could be a small scene in a larger work?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko I think that by definition, the only way to be sure is to answer the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please post links and/or extensive quotes proving the ‘We’ve done extensive research with how other sites on the network handle explicit content. We’ve asked several staff members what’s their personal opinion and what's the network's policy with regards to explicit content.’ In the post you’ve linked, Jeff talks about ***adult web sites and links to them.*** However, we shouldn’t link directly to any anime that was id requested if solely for copyright reasons; we should link to AniDB and similar sources instead. I have no clue about manga sites out there; if there are those that *do not* […]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[…] contain scanlations etc, we can link to them. We should avoid linking to sites where you can read the manga in its entirety anyway for the same copyright reasons, so again there is ***no reason to link*** to any explicit context. I can totally understand Arquade’s and movie’s decisions, because in both communities the pornographic part is frowned upon for being badly made. For anime, I generally do not see that as the case — as depicted by the numerous other answers.


















This answer is more of a comment to Madara, but since it would have been too large to fit in a comment box, I put it as an answer.

If hentai is forbidden then should all following questions be closed as well? I have only gone through the id-requests I have personally answered and not through all of them, so there are probably many more of these cases, but all the following animes were classified as hentai by MAL.

I have to admit that it indeed felt pretty weird having to go through a bunch of hentai episodes to properly answer those questions...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First and last, no. It's impossible to tell **from the question** that the user is asking for hentai. Second and third are undeniably hentai by definition (that's what OP asks for)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha So it is allowed to ask about hentai as long as you are unaware it is...?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's allowed to ask questions whose answer may contain hentai. It's not allowed to ask questions specifically about hentai. The asker's intention here is important.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha So [question 3](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21921/6166), which you say is off-topic now, would become on-topic if the word "hentai" is removed from it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha: Note that the wording in question 3 is "seems hentai". The OP is not even sure if it is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I'll agree that #3 is borderline. But in this particular case, I'd much rather ask for forgiveness, and not permission.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha I see no reason why the asker's intention should be important. If the stated goal is to avoid being "globally banned from web filtering software", well, web filtering software certainly doesn't care about the asker's intention.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin That is true. But that's the thing with even slightly vague identification requests. You don't know what you're going to get.


















My take on this: that question was closed incorrectly, twice. Our community has a fairly clear consensus on what is and isn't allowed. We've amassed the 5 reopen votes needed to reopen the question, and that too was ignored. (For kicks: the total reputation of those voting to reopen here is 41,499, and while that obviously shouldn't factor into official policy at all, it's an indication that the people reopening here likely know what they're doing.) The moderators here are acting rogue based on their own objections to such material rather than on any site consensus or actual SE policy.

As for the general case, questions about explicit content are allowed here, at least based on the previous consensuses. But questions which are themselves explicit are not. A well-made post can avoid violating the http://stackexchange.com/legalToS, the http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policyContent Policy, and the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/be-niceBe Nice policy. So long as you keep any discussion of sexual content to a minimum, use clinical language, and avoid obscene images completely, such a question is acceptable here. In general, this isn't usually very difficult unless your question would already be inappropriate here for other reasons (e.g. a recommendation question). 

I can find nothing in the question there which is remotely problematic; the only words with sexual content are "love hotel", "suck", "impotent", "seme", and "uke", and none of these are very problematic. Sure, graphic descriptions of sexual acts would be a problem, but there is none of that here. This is almost a perfect example of how to write a question about a hentai; the only problem is that as an identification request it only barely meets the requirements. The moderator's closing of the question because of his own objections to what he believes the answer will necessarily be come off as absurd and juvenile.

In fact, the objection https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2406here demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of hentai itself. Equating "hentai" to the western concept of "porn" is completely misunderstanding many things. "Hentai" includes all series that explicitly show sexual activities. Most of these have a lot more story and characterization than western pornography. It is better to identify hentai with the western concept of "adult entertainment" which while literally synonymous to "pornography", has a completely different connotation. Many hentai like Kite or Bible Black have serious stories and very clearly can't be simply equated to "porn" without missing the entire connotation that carries. Nothing in the question here would indicate to me that this manga is any different; in fact, most of that post describes the story rather than anything sexual. 

And it's worth mentioning that adult entertainment of this type is on topic on https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263Movies SE, under exactly the same rules as here. In fact, they have https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/adult-moviesa tag for such questions, which isn't exactly complete, but at least demonstrates that the community there isn't actively removing such questions just because of their subject matter (as the new "policy" would seem to be here) but only because of the actual content of the question.



Since I know people will complain about this point unless I mention it, let me just say that the https://webapps.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364post at Meta WebApps is not SE global policy. It was posted as a proposal by a single (former) employee on a single child meta site, and doesn't hold any more weight here than it does on Yahoo Answers. While it's clear that the WebApps community is okay with it, our policy can differ (and already does, in my opinion). SE global policies are those which every site is required to follow, and those appear or are directly linked to on this site itself, e.g. the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/be-niceBe Nice policy in the help center or the legal link below. Anything else, on Meta SE, or other child meta sites, or (obviously) private discussions with anyone, while potentially useful as a guide, is not SE global policy, at least in terms of moderation. 

Furthermore, we've had employees on this meta site before discuss this very topic, and they did not state any such global policies. The most prominent is https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/759/this one by Tim Post, which says that we should seriously consider whether we want to allow hentai, but not that it needs to be banned to be compliant with SE global policy. His response is more along the lines of "children as young as 13 use these sites, and please keep that in mind". However, nothing in the closed question would be inappropriate for children as young as 13; by that age (at least in much of the world including the U.S.) such children would have learned quite a bit more explicit things in school, and the content of the question wouldn't pose a problem. The manga itself might not be appropriate for 13-year-old children, but then again, neither is something like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shingeki-no-kyojinshingeki-no-kyojin, which has gratuitous gore and violence. So long as the question and answer themselves are not problematic, we don't need to be arbitrating the content of the original works.

Indeed, quite a few other sites in the network do allow discussion of adult/sexual matters. There was a Sexuality beta site which failed for unrelated reasons, and there's a http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/62814/sexualityproposal for a similar site now. Both of these were approved by the community team, meaning that there's no network-wide ban on discussions that happen to be somewhat sexual. Here's what the current CEO of SE says with https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115732regard to a proposed Sexuality site:


  [The] site in question will be "safe for work" and require the use of clinical language, which is already the policy when discussing questions of an adult nature on other sites in our network.


That is, as best I can tell, the most official response for how adult questions are to be handled, and he didn't seem exceptionally bothered by the presence of such discussions when done appropriately. (Of course, it would be alright to ban such topics with community consensus, but https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/21as our community has clearly stated since private beta and repeatedly confirmed, we do want to allow such topics here.) So I don't agree that SE policy requires us to ban these questions.



In fact, we're just finishing an official bounty event: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2342May 2015 bounties for tags: visual novels and adaptations thereof. Of the 59 series listed there, I counted 36 (over half) which were originally 18+ eroge, and several have never had any all-ages releases or non-hentai anime adaptations. A couple, like Wanko to Kurasou, are basically nukige, which is about as close to the western concept of "porn" as visual novels get. It's hypocritical to be promoting such content on the one hand, while simultaneously blocking it on the other. Given that this event was created by another moderator, it seems like there isn't even a clear consensus among the moderators themselves as to what is allowed, which is frankly a moderation disaster if policy is being implemented on the site itself single-handedly without even discussing it with the other moderators first.

Perhaps more importantly, it's essentially impossible to have any serious discussion or Q&A about anime and manga without at some point mentioning hentai. It's rather important to actually understanding the industry as a whole, even if you never watch one. About 10% of all anime on http://myanimelist.net/MAL are rated as hentai, and that number is probably somewhat low. Manga are harder to classify, but adult-oriented manga are quite significant as well. Of course, for visual novels, the fraction is even larger, well over 50%. And while the raw numbers aren't so huge on its own, quite a few hentai works have had impact even among more mainstream works. I'm not aware of any "professional" sites for anime or manga which disallow hentai; various sites like MAL, ANN, AniDB, Hummingbird, etc. all allow it (within reason) because it's a crucial subset of anime and manga. The impact is to the point that I'd seriously question whether anyone can be considered an expert on anime or manga without ever having looked at such a work.

If anything, I'd say that hentai are something we ought to try harder to cover more completely. Right now, we're doing a terrible job at covering these series, and the new "policy" isn't going to help anything. As I understand it, the goal of this site is to become the best place to ask good anime and manga questions about all types of series, and we can't hope to be that if we're blocking a bunch at the start for silly puritan, holier-than-thou objections. 



The other, most serious practical objection I've heard to allowing hentai is that it will get us blacklisted. Realistically, as I understand it, there's little to no chance of Google blacklisting us. Google is really only concerned with blacklisting sites that are suspected of distributing Malware; plenty of strait-up pornography sites are still indexed. I only know of one case where a site was blacklisted for having sexual content, and that was only for 1 day before it was removed. The site in question specifically focuses on such things, and is still indexed today; I won't link it here but it's a very well-known blog in the anime-sphere.

Realistically, we're never going to get that bad. We probably won't get close to the 10% of all content being hentai-related that MAL has. I suspect that the level here will be 2-3% of all questions at the most, at which point this isn't even a remotely realistic possibility.

There are various internet-filtering software which might identify this site and blacklist it, but those are used by a minority of all users, and it's still quite possible for this to happen even if we block hentai completely. Most of this software is configured so that people will only go on work-related sites at work. As this is an entertainment-oriented site, there's little reason to be on it at work anyway for a majority of viewers. Hence, I don't think there would be major consequences for being blacklisted in such software. In any case, while I don't understand the exact methodology used by such software, the use of clinical terminology would presumably go a long way to avoiding being blacklisted, and beyond that I don't see a good reason we should cater to a small minority who use this software rather than a sizable portion who watch and enjoy hentai.



This is a site about anime and manga, and that obviously includes hentai. Whether or not you like it individually, we as a community need to own that, not bury it. I'm happy to do my part in this, as are quite a few other users; I'd ask that moderators not screw it up by implementing new policies out of nowhere without first seeking community consensus.

I also cleaned up a couple of other things. Is this a thing I should be doing or does it negatively affect the question by getting rid of details?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko those type of term that point towards explicit nature or any terms, pic, links that are explicit in nature should be removed though it change the meaning of the questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So to recap: Hentai should be allowed and not only within id-requests, but outside as well. Having a [tag:Bible-Black] tag would be more than fine as long as the questions are clean?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since we are defining our boundaries here, let me take it up a nodge. What about loli manga/hentai? What about manga which is appropriate/legal in Japan, but not in the US? What would we do with those?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, as long as no lewd/illegal content is in the question itself - I think it should be allowed. 

To actually view the lewd/illegal content would be the reader's decision and seperate to this site.

We have users worldwide, so any questions about stuff illegal in some areas could be answered by other users that are legally able to research the topics.

I don't know if this reflects Logan's position on this though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5re: the VN bounties thing - I did not go through and vet all the things I listed for content. A poor decision on my part, perhaps, but this does not reflect a substantive disagreement between Madara and I on the topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5re: Google not literally "blacklisting" pornographic content - yes, but it is known that Google also disfavors sites with pornographic content in their search rankings more than they used to. They don't de-index, obviously, but being lower-ranked is still something we would prefer to avoid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5re: "Realistically, we're never going to get that bad" - I don't buy this. The primary cause of hentai content on the site is ID requests, and the amount of these is still growing at an alarming rate. The statistics for specifically hentai ID requests are too sparse to be useful, but I am unwilling to reject out-of-hand the possibility that they will become more common than you anticipate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5re: "silly puritan, holier-than-thou objections" - this is an unfair characterization of the objections here. Whether _you_ like it or not, the Stack Exchange network of sites is used professionally by many people, and the existence of Hot Network Questions (at minimum) means that content from any site can leak into all the others. If this site were an independent Q&A site (say, an OSQA install) outside the SE network, I wouldn't really care too much, but as a member site of the SE network, we ought to respect broader SE-wide community standards to the extent that they exist.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5re: " "Hentai" includes all series that explicitly show sexual activities." - as you know, the specific notion of "hentai" is itself western in origin. To claim that it reflects a notion significantly different from the western conception of "pornography" is to misunderstand the usage of the term in practice. Viewed narrowly, "hentai" refers to a particular class of animated film that can be operationally characterized by the fact that it requires pixellation to be distributed in Japan. Perhaps some members of that class of film have redeeming artistic qualities, but so does, say, "Pirates".


















I don't think everybody who agrees with Logan's "hentai is technically not porn" answer understand that while it is technically correct, the ID request posters are for the most part random internet users. Those users do not read what our rules have to say about ID requests in general, and especially on explicit topics (because it's not anywhere visible enough on the site for them, which is a part of this problem, but not the biggest). 

Who can vouch for the whole internet of random people that they won't start posting inappropriate questions after they see that "we do hentai identification"? Because if that happens, the whole ID request service we provide might have to be discontinued, and of course, by that time the site's search engine ranking will be hurt considerably, because nobody can remove explicitly inappropriate posts quicker than google scans them. Do we really want to take that risk with ID requests?

I don't see a problem with appropriately worded non-ID questions about adult rated works, because non-ID questions are actually well enough regulated. But ID requests don't have strict enough rules and what rules there are,  are not obviously not good enough to prevent a potential disaster.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are id-requests really not regulated as well as non-id-requests? Maybe on the subjective points of 'enough detail' - but I think they get the same attention for anything offensive/otherwise obviously not appropriate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think I understand this answer. You seem to be claiming that by allowing identification requests about hentai, we'll get more inappropriate questions than if we don't, while simultaneously claiming that new users don't read the rules. If the problem is with inappropriate content getting posted to the site by new users who haven't read the rules and affecting our search rankings faster than we have a chance to edit it, how would a policy change requiring us to close the questions (but not delete them or edit them) help the situation?


















http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_in_the_SummerAno Natsu de Matteru was licensed by Sentai Filmworks to be released in NA under the name Waiting in the Summer.

So https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/22141/revisionsthis happened. A fairly new user posted a question with the title


  Question about Code;Geass R2 Episode 18


He tried to keep it as spoiler free as possible. This title was then shortly after changed by a different user to


  Why did Lelouch lie to Suzaku that he ordered Euphemia to massacre all the Japanese people?


While the first title was not a great title, it could be argued that the second title completely ended up on the other end of the spectrum spoiling too much, but that's not what I wanted to talk about. The first title, should indeed have been made better and while I understand that https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/47/6166searchability is more important than spoiling and we should indeed https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/120583/261323edit posts for the greater good, where do we draw the line between butting in and editing it ourselves or telling the poster about our guidelines, making him learn and do it him/herself? At the meta post it is said (among other good points) that we should


  Make posts easier to understand, which helps both readers and the original poster


Yet, on the other hand we should keep in mind that


  When you edit other's posts, you're still editing their content.


So how far should we take our editing? What is more important? Letting people do they own thing or impose our guidelines onto them, whether they want it or not, because in this case OP was clearly not happy about the change?



Another example mentioned by mirroroftruth: https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/13326/revisionshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/13326/revisions

If it's a bad quality question, it should be edited. But there's nothing to stop it being edited again if someone doesn't think it's up to scratch.

For example you could edit the title to "Why did Lelouch lie to Suzaku in episode 18?" which avoids the spoilers (thanks btw :'( )

But for this case, I think a balance between just-enough-detail is more preferable for title like this (indexable by search engine, but doesn't spoil the reader in the first place)


















Basics

The name of the site should be written in a clear, easy-to-read font in English: “Anime and Manga” or “Anime & Manga.”
The font used should always be the same (in site design, on facebook, etc.): Think like famous, successful logos such as ESPN, FedEx, ebay, Star Wars, etc.

The logo should generally be a square or round shape (think like the McDonald’s “M”, the Apple apple, the Pepsi circle, the Starbucks mermaid, the AT&T “Death Star,” the Nike checkmark, the Superman “S,” logos of TV channels and car manufacturers) so that it can be shown stand-alone in a compact space OR paired next to the name of the site.  Notice how the main SE logo does this: there is a square logo to the left of the easy-to-read words “StackExchange.”

The logo should be as simple as possible so that it becomes easily recognizable (McDonalds and Apple’s logos are easier to conjure up in your mind than the Starbucks mermaid or KFC’s Colonel Sanders). Helpful advice is available at the Graphic Design SE: the most useful ones are https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/30262/what-are-the-key-principles-that-effective-designs-shareWhat are the key principles that effective designs share? and https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/27/what-technical-objective-qualities-do-good-logos-haveWhat technical/objective qualities do good logos have?, but there are more https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/220/how-can-i-design-a-simple-logo-without-any-prior-skill-in-graphic-designhere, https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/3565/what-should-be-taken-into-consideration-when-designing-a-logohere, https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/29549/any-books-on-actual-how-to-of-logo-designhere, https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/297/learning-logo-designhere, and https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/27705/how-to-design-a-simple-text-and-a-shape-logo-for-a-websitehere.

I advise no Japanese syllabary (“lettering” such as kanji, hiragana, katakana) in images such as logo, banner, buttons, and mascot design. For those who cannot read it, including it in the logo or on a button could be off-putting and they feel like they are in the dark, like this site is too esoteric. There are other cases in the site where it makes sense to provide Japanese, but not in the site design.

Any illustration needs to accurately reflect standard, recognizable anime/manga art style even if it is illustrated by someone who is not a pro in Japan. Of course real mangaka bear different art styles, but I can almost always detect whether an illustration is professional manga or high-quality doujinshi, versus drawn by a non-Japanese outside of Japan in basic imitation of the general art style (for example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_English-language_mangaOEL "manga", http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Manga-influenced_comicsanime/manga-inspired comics and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anime_and_manga_inspired_webcomicsweb-comics, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime-influenced_animationanime-influenced animation). To convey a sense of authority, the illustration must not look non-anime/manga style (like Avatar: The Last Air-Bender character design) and it must not look like amateur fanart. There are many talented fanart artists on http://www.pixiv.net/Pixiv, so someone who can pull off authentic-looking anime painted cel (or computer animated) art and/or manga art should be commissioned or recruited if original illustration is desired.

... “Ayama” is counter-intuitive because 1) it is not at all clear to a first-time visitor what the word is supposed to mean, 2) it is not even clear to many of us otaku as to what it is supposed to mean, and 3) Japanese contractions are in the format of the first two syllables of the first word + the first two syllables of the second word, which would be “Ani” (アニ) + “Man” (漫＝まん) = “AniMan.”  “AniMan” is not a good name to choose because it sounds male-centric (given that “man” is a gendered English word).

Specifics

Logo
Yes.

The Logo and Buttons need to be anime/manga specific (something that originated in anime/manga, not something generally about Japanese culture that could just as easily be adopted for the logo/buttons of the https://japanese.stackexchange.com/Japanese Language SE or the http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/59039/japanese-cultureJapanese Culture SE). Furthermore, something like a cherry blossom is associated by Japanese people with Japanese culture, but it is not a tree exclusive to Japan. The http://scifi.stackexchange.comScience Fiction & Fantasy SE uses the Rebel Alliance logo from Star Wars for its buttons, which fits the theme well because it is an image that is specific to sci-fi and is never found outside of sci-fi (it would not fit as a button for any other SE).

An example could be an adaption of an item that was featured in a classic manga or anime, such as an iconic item in Testuwan Atom (Astro Boy) since Osamu Tezuka is generally regarded as the “God of Manga” in Japan and outside of Japan. Oda Eiichiro (who created ONE PIECE) may be the most well-known mangaka alive in Japan today, but adopting something more timeless than current series might be preferable.

... I advise a logo design other than https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/426/what-should-our-unofficial-community-name-and-logo-or-mascot-be/459#459ʞɹɐzǝɹ’s mon (family crest) logo style because, while a mon is recognizable within Japanese culture and among some anime/manga fans, 1) many will not register what it is supposed to be, and 2) according to Japanese cultural convention (as far as I know), new mon cannot be invented, in the same way that certain kanji cannot be combined to create a new name that is considered culturally "proper." It could be viewed as awkward, or at worst, disrespectful, by Japanese visitors to the site.

Banner
Yes.

It should feature the Logo and the name of the site in easy-to-read font.

Google Doodle-style Changing Banner
No. 

Google can do it because almost every internet user in the world instantly recognizes the Google logo, so they can make adaptions to it and people will still know they’re at the Google website. Any logo that is not on the level of McDonald’s or Coca-Cola cannot change up their logo or visitors can get confused.

Google Doodles http://www.google.com/doodles?q=japanesealready feature Japanese holidays and occasions such as http://www.google.com/doodles/setsubun-2015Setsubun, http://www.google.com/doodles/girls-day-hinamatsuri-2011Hina Matsuri, http://www.google.com/doodles/tanabata-2014Tanabata, etc. so it would not be unique to do this at SE.

Mascot
Yes.

Anime/manga tend to have mascots, so it is fitting.

The mascot can be the logo, or it can be used elsewhere. Like a logo, it should be simple (not require a lot of lines to draw).

Preferably a cute chibi (square-ish) mascot (think like magical girls' animal guides, or cell phone charms carried by anime characters), since those are more common in anime/manga than human-sized or non-cute mascots.

Button Icons and "Ask a Question" Button Gimmick
Yes — but only if these are originated in anime/manga and not too series-specific. 

This site should ideally feel inviting to fans of shounen, shoujo, children’s anime, etc.  Choosing buttons or a gimmick that some demographics would not recognize would not help broaden the user base, and could send an unintentional message that a certain series or genre is more important than others.

Again, something from an established and renowned classic like Tezuka’s work might be better than something contemporary.

An alternate theme for buttons could be a small illustration of a http://www.jamieism.com/1883/prince-of-tennis/become-mangaka-part-2-learn-toolstool of the trade used in manga illustration or in anime production (before some artists have switched over to computer), such as the http://deleter-mangashop.com/goods_en_usd_732.htmlfeather sweeper which is iconic in Bakuman. and can be see in Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun and Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to, or the http://deleter-mangashop.com/goods_en_usd_735.htmlcurve ruler or the chunky black ink bottle.









Badge Icons
Yes.

Again, something that originated in anime/manga yet not too specific that some people feel left out.
The https://gaming.stackexchange.com/help/badgesArqade SE uses coins, so it would not necessarily overlap to think up something that connotes leveling up in a game.

Although it is specific to one anime title, if it could be somehow accomplished without committing copyright infringement, how about a http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball"poké ball" (known as a "monster ball" in the original Japanese version)? 1) Pokemon is not strongly associated with a particular genre such as moe or shoujo and the series has been running non-stop from 1997 to the present without signs of running out of steam even though it has spawned a bunch of copycats, 2) the series became well-known around the world beyond the otaku demographic (from little kids up through their parents) via the video game and customizable card game (and the infamous news story about seizures) and the animated part of the franchise is generally understood to be Japanese animation by non-otaku, and 3) it's a "gotta catch 'em all" item which fits the idea of collecting badges. How did the Science Fiction & Fantasy SE get permission to use a Star Wars logo for their buttons?

... I advise badges that do not reflect the imperial regalia, since that is political, historical, and cultural rather than anime/manga specific.

Site Design
Yes, if it is clean.

The best site design is simple (think of Wikipedia, Anime News Network, etc.) and primarily white in background color, so visitors can easily find things quickly.
A simple, clean layout connotes authority, which helps visitors and users trust that the answers are reputable and trustworthy (for example, see https://stackoverflow.com/StackOverflow SE, the https://english.stackexchange.com/English Language & Usage SE, the https://math.stackexchange.com/Mathematics SE, etc.).

Even though the https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade SE uses bright colors, the artwork is very simple (retro) rather than in-your-face excitement bursting at the viewer.

See https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5037/what-are-some-common-mistakes-that-a-designer-can-make-when-designing-for-web-aWhat are some common mistakes that a designer can make when designing for web, and how can they be avoided?, https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/3503/what-makes-a-design-professionalWhat makes a design professional?, and https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/307/how-to-direct-users-eyes-on-a-websiteHow to direct users eyes on a website at the Graphic Design SE.

Color Scheme

One idea: Bold color on the left side margin to represent anime, and black and white on the right side margin to represent manga.

This could be done with キルア’s idea of the manga sheets hanging out from each side: it could be the edge of anime cells on the left and the edge of manga pages on the right. This would have color, fit the theme of the SE, but not be intrusive.

See https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/3245/how-can-i-improve-my-color-selection-skillHow can I improve my color selection skill? at the Graphic Design SE.

CSS Style
No.

I second Ankit Sharma's concern about season-based design (unless it were optional in account settings, so some users could opt to see a simple/clean layout similar to the current one, some could choose summer, and some could choose winter, based on their location on the globe). Ideally, SE would be frequented by people from many nations, and they ought not be off-put by a northern hemisphere-centric design just because Japan is north of the equator.

What is the first thing you want users to see when they visit the site?

Name of the SE in clear font, links to “About” and “FAQ” for first-time visitors, and a list of Questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point about a simple mascot - then it'll be easier to incorporate them into things :)


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/13453/why-was-there-never-a-dub-for-skip-beatWhy was there never a dub for Skip Beat? was originally closed but reopened when it was changed to 'Why didn't it happen' rather than 'When will it happen'

Another question appeared recently https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22186/has-tokyo-ghoul-been-dubbed-in-englishhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22186/has-tokyo-ghoul-been-dubbed-in-english asking "Why has Tokyo Ghoul root A not been dubbed in English?" which was closed under unannounced future events.

Is it on-topic or off-topic to ask why something hasn't been done? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about why something didn't happen on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5personally i think they have the same problems as unannounced eventsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sometimes there might be some known story behind why something didn't happen that answers can recount (e.g. if I asked "Why wasn't Kodomo no Jikan released in the US?", there's a well-documented story behind it). But largely, I agree that they have the same problems as unannounced future events: there's no way to know unless you have inside info.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure if on topic here, but at least related; Unannounced future events seem to be a problem on its own. Questions about future events seem to be closed regardless whether they are actually announced or not. While I agree they are bad questions and would be solved by a simple google query in most cases, it seems we don't even bother to check first (the same goes for image ID requests)


















I agree with much of what's been mentioned so far, especially the posts by キルア, seijitsu, and Toshinou-san. In particular, I agree with seijitsu that we should try to stay away from specific recent series and make the site inviting to everyone, and both seijitsu and Toshinou-san cautioned against lapsing into purely Japanese imagery which is only associated with anime and manga in Western minds.

Otherwise, I have a few random suggestions:

Mascot

I like the idea of a mascot, either an animal mascot or a cute girl mascot. I like a cute girl mascot, but I can see why that might be less than inviting to some users. Maybe something that resembles Madoka's Kyuubei (but without the evil).

Color Scheme

I like the idea of an azure and white color scheme, like Aria's predominant color scheme:



To me, it feels relaxing (like readers should feel when they're browsing a fun site about anime), but it can also look fairly solid and official. It's low-key, but not boring. 

Original Art

Gao and seijitsu both mentioned getting someone from Pixiv to do some art for us. I think that would be amazing.

Badges

One of the older threads had a suggestion to use shuriken as badges, and it seems that suggestion won't die. I don't really like it. Although I did like Toshinou Kyouko's suggestion of cherry blossoms, seijitsu is right that this is more Japanese than particularly anime.

What about using a stylized quill pen, like the ones mangaka draw with? 



It has a distinctive shape (especially in side-view), it's easy to color gold/silver/bronze, and it's specific to manga. http://movies.stackexchange.comMovies and TV uses a film reel for badges; this is similar to that.

Accepted Answers

This might be too purely Japanese, but what about a maru (circle) sign for our accepted answers instead of a check? Reason: https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/17101/7579see this question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the idea of a maru sign for the accepted answers! The second candidate I have in mind is an ink stamp. Either way, the color for the accepted answer mark should be red. Aria's color scheme is welcome, as it is not too different (yet still distinguishable) from the beta site colors that we are used to. Blue is probably also the single color that best describes most anime and manga: melancholy and sex (of which Aria is neither).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao I was also thinking that lots of anime of various genres have beach scenes or sky scenes or use the clear blue sky as symbolism, or just to show off the artists's skills, so the azure and white color scheme would be evocative for lots of different readers, without being too genre-specific.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the idea of maru (o) for accepted answers, except that a maru alone without a batsu (x) and sankaku (triangle) is not very easily understandable. As it is, a lot of users do not seem to understand that they should (or, perhaps, how to) select an accepted answer, so a maru will not help them know they should click on it. What about a [hanamaru](http://meitanteisonoko.tumblr.com/page/2) which Japanese teachers write on tests? It can be seen in anime, but it's still a bit esoteric, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@seijitsu I think people will have a higher chance of recognizing the maru on PlayStation and other game console controllers than the (yes, esoteric) hanamaru. Yahoo answers' way is to inform users to accept answers by displaying "is this answer helpful?" I don't think we can get any clearer than that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao, as the Anime and Manga SE, not all users possess gaming experience, and since gaming is the subject of the Arqade SE, using a button symbol that is (outside of Japan) primarily only known among gamers is not anime/manga-themed. In that sense, I meant to say that while the maru & the hanamaru both symbolize the function of an accepted answer to those who are in the know, _both_ of these are esoteric and may cause more users to fail to select an accepted answer (which already happens a lot). A maru alone looks like a circle so even people who've seen game controllers may not recognize it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maru, batsu, & sankaku are used in Japanese culture in many contexts such as [school grades](http://ginstrom.com/scribbles/2008/02/19/translating-maru-batsu-into-english), [classroom games](http://genkienglish.net/marubatsu.htm), and [TV game shows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsu_game) so they don't hold an association with anime and manga or with video game controllers in the minds of Japanese otaku. These symbols easily suit the Japanese Language SE or the Japanese Culture SE. Gaming consoles have a power button but that symbol is not associated with games since it's also used elsewhere.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@seijitsu I like the hanamaru a lot--it's more distinctive and more fun than the plain maru, and when I saw the picture you linked I immediately thought "Oh yeah, I've seen that!" But I do have some reservations about all these symbols being just Japanese and not specific to anime, as you warned about in your answer. In the end, I'm really just against anything that makes us look like "Naruto & One Piece.SE".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The hanamaru could also be a good choice for badgesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda, oh, that's a good idea to use hanamaru for badges rather than for the select answer button: it could be done in different colors, and being somewhat esoteric isn't as crucial on badges as it is regarding the buttons that everyone needs to use. Apparently the link I gave is like a blog that updates, so newer posts will be coming ahead of the hanamaru posts, which are actually [here](http://meitanteisonoko.tumblr.com/post/120346143477/next-conans-hint-hanamaru-flower-circle) and [here](http://meitanteisonoko.tumblr.com/post/120346523904/meitantei-conan-episode-780-a-scarlet-pursuit).


















To cultivate a welcoming site for first-time visitors, it makes sense to answer easy and basic questions. In order to graduate, we need a corpus of repeat users, so if answering a new user's simple question helps more new users become interested in SE in the first place (instead of feeling like the site is only for experts and get deterred from getting involved), that's a good thing.

Repeat and long-term users wouldn't normally ask such easy questions here, so once a newbie gets used to the SE format and the Anime and Manga SE's specific guidelines, they likely will naturally become less interested in asking basic questions that they could find at the top of the first page of Google search results in 10 seconds. I don't think answering such questions would generally lead to more of them being asked by the same person. If each new user asked a couple of such questions but then a fair percentage of those users felt encouraged to get more involved and start asking more interesting questions, and a percentage of those folks became long-term staples of the community, it would benefit the site.

When I answer a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22155/did-sakura-lose-her-virginity-to-kakashiquestion that seems silly, or extremely beginner-level, or simple, I do my best to make my answer educational by expanding on the question (if we simply closed such a question for being remedial, incorrect assumptions and unfounded rumors would spread further... and then more people in the future might ask the same question). If we flesh out the answer beyond a single sentence or yes/no, the OP gets the question answered, but anyone else who looks at it afterward might also learn something useful from it. For the question "Who is the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho?," Torisuda did not only provide Togashi's name but filled out the answer with some general info: he also is well-known for HUNTER x HUNTER, how he came up with Yuu Yuu Hakusho, and that he is married to another very famous mangaka. That is value added content that makes reading the answer contribute to the informative aspect of the site and could pique a rookie's interest in exploring more and thereby becoming more knowledgeable over time ("Oh, he wrote HUNTER x HUNTER too? I've heard of that, maybe I should check it out").

StackOverflow has a somewhat different situation: it is a Q&A site open to anyone but it aims to be extremely useful to professionals working in the field. The Anime and Manga SE is not primarily comprised of nor targeting as its user base 1) professional mangaka, animation directors, and animators in Japan, 2) translators and professionals in the licensing business, or 3) manga and anime scholars conducting academic research in universities inside and outside of Japan, so it is not primarily aiming to answer the sort of specialized questions that those demographics would be more likely to ask (such users and such questions would certainly be welcome and on-topic here, but they would likely ask/answer niche or hard-to-find information that the pros can't even easily get ahold of in Japanese publications and news sources). At this point, this SE is primarily aiming to be a resource for non-industry anime and manga enthusiasts, and thereby belittling people or looking down on them for being green is counter-intuitive. A goal is to foster a fan culture of better-informed viewers and readers.

I've adopted the philosophy from your third paragraph even on Stack Overflow--rather than just downvote questions which are based on false premises, I try to figure out what misconceptions the questioner has that led them to ask the question, and correct those in my answer. If the question is extremely basic, I try to "teach them to fish" and point to resources in a friendly way, while also answering their question. It's not a popular thing to do on SO, but it seems like a better way to address inexperienced users than getting annoyed.


















Our feed bots post questions with delays of up to 20 minutes. Could we make them post as soon as questions appear on the main page or in Questions tab?

The feed users are not rate-limited, so the refresh rate is the only thing that would stop a room from being absolutely swamped. While 20 minutes is rather long to wait, I don't think it should be reduced below 1-2 minutes for that reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think developers are so silly that they would let something like this happen. Worst case scenario they could fix it in a matter of minutes for a very long time.


















As proposed in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2394/event-proposal-lets-start-doing-a-featured-spotlight-on-good-questions-and-quethis meta, let's call out the very best question and answers on our site to be noticed by Senpai. No matter how new or no matter how old. As long as they haven't been closed or are against SE guidelines, they're fair game!



Nominate question and answers that are good and noteworthy, the ones that need improvement, or have been neglected, but could use some touch up questions and answers you think this site has to offer! Give them more publicity! Show new users what good questions and answer look like and/or give life to some old questions that deserve a second chance.

You can nominate a question (answered or unanswered) or answer (accepted or not accepted) that you personally think you should be featured. 

On every first weekend of the month, a good (or one the need improvement/attention) question and/or answer will be chosen and feature in meta and promoted on our http://fbl.me/animeseFacebook and http://goo.gl/jcdBXFGoogle+ community pages. You're free to share them on other sites/channel that you frequent, if you so please. Nominated question and answer that have been featured will be edited to include the date, month and year it was featured and a link to the meta post of when it was featured.

If you haven't voted on the featured question or answer, it's recommended you give them an upvote. If you really like an answer, why not consider giving it an upvote?

Limit your nominations to one question or answer per answer post. You may submit as many questions or answers as you'd like, but make sure that question or answer hasn't been nominated before you post. It's okay to nominate your own question and/or answer. It's all fair game! Even self answered questions.

If your question doesn't get selected, don't fret! There are more chances as there are months to come!

Try to follow this general format:


  (Type of nomination, e.g. "Question")
  
  (Title of and link to the question or answer.)
  
  (Short paragraph or two of why you chose to nominate it. Was it good or was it bad? What can we do to improve it if it was bad or neglected? Be persuasive!) 


Leave a comment here or in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-this chatroom, if you have any question, concerns, complaints, suggestions, etc.

Should we allow genre meta tags, and if so, should they be applicable to any series within that genre so that fans of that genre can more easily find those questions in order to answer them/learn more, or only to questions inquiring about the genre itself?

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/15533/what-is-the-target-demographic-of-yuki-yuna-is-a-heroWhat is the target demographic of Yuki Yuna is a Hero?


I would propose that 


A "genre" tag could be useful for people to use when asking a question about differences between or about similarities between genres and demographics. It would be nice if questions like those above could be located in an easy-to-find location for users interested in answering and reading questions about genre.
Anime/manga-specific genre tags (such as "shoujo," "mahou shoujo", "yuri," yaoi," "moe," "nichijou," "seinen," etc.) could be useful so that, for example, someone who is an expert in "josei" could easily find questions about their area of speciality to answer, and to find answers of interest to read, without having to wade through many questions searching by series title. I, for one, would use such tags to periodically check for questions I could likely answer.
Although https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2239/8134previous discussion posited that "a genre-based tag could work, but it would need to be used on questions about the genre itself (e.g. production, tropes, etc.) and not questions about individual series," and that "Tagging series questions with genre tags would make the series tags redundant and the genre tags bloated," I would suggest that the series tags would not become redundant, because a user who can generally answer "shoujo" questions and is interested in reading their answers is not likely to search title by title just to check for them, especially since the OP might not know the title (for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request) or the user might not remember the title off-hand in order to search for it but would recognize it if seen within that tag.
Some of the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2238/8134previous reasons given for not creating a "hentai" tag were variations on being age-appropriate for a 13+ age, which is not applicable regarding genre tags other than "hentai" and possibly "yaoi" and "yuri."
Genre tags that are not specific to anime/manga (such as "sci-fi," "romance," "comedy") would be less useful than those for genres which have originated in anime/manga. I would make a motion that only genres which have developed through anime/manga mediums get tags. I don't think there are so many anime/manga-specific genres that the number of genre tags would be too unwieldy, nor that frequent users would try to pile a ton of genre tags all onto one question.
Meta tags which were https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/402/8134previously voted against were "characters," "character-abilities," "variations," and "plot-explanation," which I heartily agree with as 1) not helping users to find questions and answers of interest via searching by tag, 2) "don't add much to the question," and 3) "hurt search engine visibility." Anime/manga-specific genre tags would contribute to search engine optimization rather than detract from it.

The most popular tag on a question gets auto-added to the HTML title of the question page. So currently we have e.g. "akatsuki no yona - How did Ki-ja the Hakuryuu (the White Dragon) get this scar?". But with genre tags, this would become "shoujo - How did Ki-ja the Hakuryuu (the White Dragon) get this scar?", which is significantly worse for searchability.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin, I see; is there no way to auto-add the first 2 tags to the HTML title of the question page instead of only one? Is that something SE format can't allow? For this SE to be found in a search engine by a search for "Akatsuki no Yona" is useful, but getting high search rankings for words like "shoujo" and "moe" would also be beneficial since those words are searched far more often. If I Google "shoujo," this SE doesn't show up within 5 pages of search results (I didn't check past 5, which most seekers wouldn't); wouldn't we want this SE to be a go-to authority on basic topics like these?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@seijitsu: I'm not sure if adding 2 tags would solve the problem with series tag. Our site has lots of spoiler in nature, so I don't think we should show up on such vague queries with the genre. On the other hand, general questions about the genre in general may benefit from the addition of genre tags.


















Question (attention/more answers)

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/17167/why-do-guys-in-anime-often-lack-nipplesWhy do guys in anime often lack nipples?

I think this is a question that can probably have a good definitive answer (cultural, law based perhaps) but doesn't just yet. 

I think the correct answer would probably be an interesting read as over here manipples are a-ok for most age ratings if not all. Especially when the focus is not sexual (like swimming)

As much as the 'no one wants to see guy's nipples' is humourous - I would like to see if we can find out the real answer.

I don't know if they're a good thing. I feel that they could keep expanding until they're unmaintainably large:

I read a lot of shoujo, and I do see that having the tag would be useful if you wanted to only answer shoujo questions (or similar) - but a search for the word shoujo or finding particular series seems sufficient to me. Tags seem more to indicate what the post is about rather than a description of the contents. 

Example: The question is about looking for an id for an anime. The question is not about shoujo anime. (rather it is a description of the id-request)

One thing I would recommend regardless is setting up your favourite tags so that those questions are hilighted for you.



I might expand on this later, but I'm currently at work - so I'm making it community wiki if other people want to tag onto this side of the argument
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I have set up my favorite series tags, but questions about them rarely get posted, unfortunately. I wouldn't bother to set up favorite tags for all the series I know about but don't especially care for just for the sake of getting wind of when something gets asked; as just one example, I wouldn't favorite the tag for _Fushigi Yugi_, but if there were a shoujo tag and I saw a question about FY show up that I knew the answer to, then I'd be happy to answer. Without a shoujo tag, I'm sure a lot of shoujo series questions go unnoticed by me, such as . . .b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5. . . ones like [this](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3498/how-was-tamahome-able-to-get-out-of-the-book-the-universe-of-the-four-gods) where the OP hasn't written the word "shoujo" in the question and only tags it with the series name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's a great point about the possibility of an OP piling on a stream of genre tags. If the idea of genre tags goes forward, I'd propose that "shounen" doesn't actually need a genre tag since that is the largest corpus of series (its like a default). It might be sensible to also exclude "yuri," "yaoi," & "BL" and to only include "shoujo-ai" and "shounen-ai" as genre tags in keeping with 13+ age appropriateness, which can curb accidental duplicating. If moderators & others see contradictory tags like "shoujo" as well as "josei" both claimed on a single question, the false one could be removed.



















  
  Anime/manga-specific genre tags (such as "shoujo," "mahou shoujo", "yuri," yaoi," "moe," "nichijou," "seinen," etc.) could be useful so that, for example, someone who is an expert in "josei" could easily find questions about their area of speciality to answer, and to find answers of interest to read, without having to wade through many questions searching by series title. I, for one, would use such tags to periodically check for questions I could likely answer.
  





  
  Meta tags which were previously voted against were "characters," "character-abilities," "variations," and "plot-explanation," which I heartily agree with as 1) not helping users to find questions and answers of interest via searching by tag, 2) "don't add much to the question," and 3) "hurt search engine visibility." Anime/manga-specific genre tags would contribute to search engine optimization rather than detract from it.
  


I disagree with tagging a question with genre tag in addition to the series title for the following reasons:


Without exception, the genre tags will end up having more question than the rest of the series tag. For the same reason as why the rest of the meta tags are frowned upon, it will hurt search engine visibility. Note that this refers to ranking of our pages on external search engines -- like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. -- not the search engine on SE.

Since the genre tag, which has the highest count of questions, will be placed in the title of the HTML page, as the search engine gives more weight to matches in the page title over the matches in the page body, questions from our site will rank lower.

Do note that it's natural to search for the name of the series rather than the genre of the series on search engines.
Even if the problem above is resolved, as the number of genre tags expands, so is the amount of effort to keep the tags consistent over all questions of a series, for existing questions and incoming questions.

This is not yet mentioning all the potential meta issues that come with the introduction of genre tags (e.g. Which genre tags should series X have? How should we add genre tags for questions with 2 series tags? Question ABC will exceed the 5-tag limit - which genre tag should be removed?).
When a question is tagged with series tag, the genre is mostly not relevant to the subject-matter in the question. It only serves to describe the series tag.


While I agree that the current system is not ideal for users to look for and answer questions by genre, I don't think tagging every question with its genres is a good solution.

Maybe a better solution is a tagging system for tags, where series tags are tagged with their genres (since the main purpose here is to look for series by genre), though the chances that it's implemented here at SE is small, since it will introduce significant changes to the existing system.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that this answer doesn't say that the whole genre tag idea is bad. I only say that it's bad when used in tandem with series tag. For genre tag in id-req and discussion about genre-specific characteristics, I'm still open, since it sounds like a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"tagging system for tags"  +1 for that ideab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Tagging the tags" is a very good idea (albeit probably one with no possibility of implementation), but genre tags are a very bad idea (except for questions _about_ the genre itself, e.g. "how did X come to be a common motif in genre Y", and so forth).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess it would be possible to jury-rig a system of "tagging the tags" on top of tag wikis - if we put structured metadata into the wikis (JSON in HTML comments or something?), we could, in principle, write third-party tools to query that metadata and do fancy things with it. This would be useful for addressing OP's point #2.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5can we restrict searches to tag-wiki exerpt only, for example? if so, we could put the genre in the tag-wiki of the series, and then search there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mindwin: We can put them in the tag wiki of the series (not the tag excerpt, though), but I don't think it helps filtering/searching for the series by tag directly, unless we use a 3rd party app to display (like what senshin suggested).


















No, this does not seem reasonably scoped to me. There will be likely hundreds of anime and related media containing this kind of style.

Even if the number of anime featuring this style is only 2 or 3, in reality the person answering it would legitimately have to be aware of the art style in thousands of anime to be able to answer it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To add to the point here - even if we does allow it with community wiki + wiki lock, the question will be useless without people updating it. The way SE works doesn't give enough exposure of the question and incentive for people to add the content to a community wiki.


















Usually if something is an issue, there'll be a paper trail.

If we go to the relevant http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Madara_Uchihatalk page - there's only a small discussion about hair colours. The users involved don't have anything relevant on their talk pages either. 

If you check the History page (or on the change itself, its just less obvious there), there's a comment by the author of the change: 


  halvsies


So I imagine it was just to slim down content to the essentials. Rather than it being removed for inaccuracies 

Overall, it'd be preferable if users would use the references that the wikis point to if available as they are a better source of information. 

TLDR - follow paper trail, prefer primary sources
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's say that the wiki decides some information is wrong. OK, they can change the information. What should we do in that case?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess comment and wait for the author to edit the post - and a new answer if necessary maybe?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think there should be a way to raise a warning about outdated content, like Wikipedia, since our site deals with a lot of content which can get outdated. Comment and ask the author to fixed, as stated in the question,  is not effective for inactive users. Adding a new answer also depend on the knowledge of the person, and the editor does nit necessarily know enough about the series to put up an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5with the current SE system, I suppose you could place some temporary text above the quote/reference - as a warning for readers that the info is outdated. But this kind of fits into the bad rejection of edits reason 'against the authors intent'. (hopefully this would be a very seldom occurrence though and probably would have more than one person knowing about it)

and many others that you can see at https://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/synonymshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/synonyms


I don't like doing this (these partial-name synonyms are incredibly ugly and I would much prefer to have more characters available for tag names), but I think that this is one good way to help ensure that low-rep users trying to ask questions about these long-named series are able to find a tag for what they're looking for. 

For example, it is entirely possible that a person who has watched Oregairu will not actually know that it is often abbreviated "Oregairu", and will instead try to type the title they know - either Japanese "Yahari Ore no..." or English "My Teen Romantic...". With these ugly partial-name synonyms in place, the odds they'll find what they're looking for is higher.

Does this seem like a good idea? Should I continue doing this?

I support this idea, despite it being a monstrous, horrible hack.

I read your answer on the Stack Exchange meta post arguing for longer tag limits (https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/259377here it is for anyone who hasn't seen it) and agree with everything you said. I don't see why it would be a problem to have tags go to … after 25 characters if having long tags creates some layout problem. I suspect the 25-character limit was just a decision the developers made early on for expediency, which has now become a problem.

On the other hand, I'm somewhat pessimistic that what I would expect to be a rather large change to the code will be made on behalf of a tiny site like Anime and Manga, or even a larger site like Movies and TV. I suspect this hack is what we're going to be stuck with. And it is better than having the "official" abbreviation be our only tag name, especially when the "official" abbreviation is as bizarre as these:


Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is "Haganai"
Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! is "Watamote"
Yahari Ore no Seishun Rabu Kome wa Machigatteiru is "Oregairu"
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata is "Saekano"


It looks as if they just picked some random syllables during a linear sweep of the full title. At least if https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tomodachi-ga-sukunaitomodachi-ga-sukunai is a tag, I can type part of the title into the tag search bar and have something pop up.

I fear that we're stuck with this for now. I guess if Stack Exchange won't grant our request for longer tags, we could try lobbying the anime industry in Japan to pick shorter titles that would fit in 25 characters.

That is, "ha", "ga", "na", and "i". Thus, "Haganai". Why this ended up being the standard abbreviation I don't know, but there you have it.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin I did figure that out after staring at it for a minute or two the first time I saw it, but it's still a very bizarre abbreviation, especially for people who know even less Japanese than I do. Sadly, it's not the most bizarre in that list. I can only assume "Saekano" comes from some weird furigana trick where "heroine" is also read as "kanojo"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yup, that's how "Saekano" happens. You write it "kanojo" and then stick furigana on it that say "heroine". Classic light novel buffoonery.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin Seriously, we should just lobby the Japanese publishers to stop using such long, crazy names. The Japanese release of "Snakes on a Plane" changed the title to "Snakeflight"--why can't light novel publishers use the same standards?


















This is because upvotes on questions do not reflect your expertise in a field represented by the tag. To quote from https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/156380/266094a Meta Stack Exchange post from https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/141525/animusonanimuson:


  Including questions in the score isn't very viable because upvotes on questions generally only mean that you asked a good question. It doesn't necessarily prove any proficiency in the tag itself.


However, you can see your score in questions of the tag by hovering over the counter.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the logic behind this is a lot more clear on, say, Stack Overflow or Math than here. If I ask lots of questions about C++, that just means I'm confused by C++ (and who isn't?). If I ask a question about, say, Fate/Stay Night, I probably have a basic level of knowledge on Fate/Stay Night to have even formed the question, so it's less obvious that asking questions doesn't reflect expertise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda: You have a point, although all SE sites share the same software. On culture, recreational and science sites, asking reflects expertise as well, but wasn't taken into account on the original design of the tag score system.


















As some may or may not be aware, quite recently at Anime Expo, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1311401276/little-witch-academia-2/descriptionLittle Academia 2: The Enchanted Parade premiered at AnimeExpo on 07/03/15 @ 8:30p EST!

It's expected that many fans in this community were probably unable to make the convention. Being a Kickstarter backer, I have access to the advanced preview screening stream. Which is why I will offer to host at least two private community viewing sessions for the ~53 min OVA episode before July 11th, via https://rabb.it/Rabb.it. 

The rooms can have up to 10 users and there can be multiple rooms per session. Please take the time propose and vote on some stream dates times (preferably for two different global time zones) to host these sessions. Recording the stream during this session will be prohibited. 

Please note that this is a private community event and not affiliated with StackExchange. All are welcomed to participate. The only requirement to attend is that you have an active chat account as invites will be distributed via chat. While this is a non-affiliated community event, StackExchange's https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/be-nicecode of conduct will still apply. Any users found in violation may be removed and barred from future events.

You do not have to have watched the previous OVA to watch this one, but it will give you a better appreciation of Sucy's character.

Please note due to this being a broadcast stream, a connection speed of at least 16 Mbps (megabits/s, or ~2 MBps [megabytes/s] downstream) is recommended.

If at least 2 other ppl was willing to start it at that time slot, I'll host it.

Continuing on the tradition, let us tag as many series as possible, so that new users can find the tags easily without having to dabble with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag workaround.

The list of off-topic things on https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourour tour page is extremely long. There are eleven items on the list; no other Stack Exchange site has more than eight (Server Fault, WebApps, Programmers, and Apple lead the pack). The total amount of text we have is also crazy long, at 1721 characters (vs. just 774 characters on the next runner-up, Apple). (cf. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ReHahM9sraw data on pastebin)

This is kind of absurd. Now, granted, people don't often read the tour page, but if they do, they will see that we are a bunch of angry internet soup nazis who hate fun. While this is probably true to some extent, we don't need to throw that in new users' faces. 

As such, I propose we remove the following items from the list of off-topic things:


Questions about the Japanese language, which should be on https://japanese.stackexchange.com/Japanese Language


People do ask these questions occasionally, but they're easy to deal with - we can just edit it to make it on topic if feasible; migrate to Japanese.SE if it's otherwise a good question; or close it if it isn't. I don't think this merits a spot in the list on the tour page.

Questions about the gameplay of anime-related and/or manga-related games, which should be on https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade


We don't have issues with people asking this sort of question, as far as I know. This seems to be a relic from early 2013 or so.

Questions on making your own anime or manga, as they involve specific expertise outside the scope of this community. See: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6/are-questions-about-how-to-make-anime-and-manga-off-topicAre Questions about "How to make Anime and Manga" off-topic?


These questions are rare enough that I doubt this item needs to be in the list on the tour page. Its presence on this list probably stems from an early-beta fear that people would be overrunning this site with questions about how do I drawed manga; thankfully, that never came to pass. 

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/454/63Asking for the lyrics of a piece of music


This has never been a major issue

Questions about fansubs or other fan-translations: When is X group going to do Y release for Z series in Q language?


Nor has this.

Shopping recommendations/discussions: Should I buy X or Y? or Where is the best place to buy X? See: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/595How should we deal with questions asking for where to buy, watch, anime or manga media or such related merchandise? – Note that there are plenty of questions about anime figures and other merchandise which are acceptable, but anything asking us to compare products or vendors isn't constructive.


This also doesn't seem to have ever been a major issue.





The following reasons, then, would remain:


Anything not directly related to anime and manga: What's up with that weird emblem on Japanese mailboxes?


This is kind of redundant, in my opinion, but it seems to be conventional across SE sites to have a line saying basically "things that are not on-topic for our site are off-topic", so I guess we can keep this.

Questions calling for out-of-universe lists: What are all the anime that feature X? What are all the manga by Y? See: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-siteGood List vs. Bad List and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/587/how-should-we-deal-with-out-of-universe-questions-in-generalHow do we deal with out-of-universe questions?


I'm not 100% sold on keeping this one, but it seems useful enough to keep around. 

Reading or watching recommendations: I liked X, what should I watch next? – You're welcome to use our http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/anime-and-mangamain chat room to ask about such topics


This one definitely needs to stay, since we get lots of these questions.

Questions requesting illegal or copyrighted information: Where can I watch anime X online? Where can I download chapters of manga Y?


This is also useful to keep, since we get a fair number of these questions.

Questions about unannounced/speculative future events in regard to anime or manga production: Will manga X get an anime adaptation? Are they going to make a Nth season of Y anime? See: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27/what-do-we-do-with-questions-about-future-events-releasesWhat do we do with questions about future events/releases?


Same as above; we get a fair number of these. 



Thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Proposal: pare down the list of off-topic things on the tour pageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Make sure to update the list in the help center as well if you do this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Should we do that? I think it makes more sense for the [help center page](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) to be comprehensive and list all the things we don't want, and for the tour page to be brief and only cover a few major things we don't want.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that our off-topic list is a bit long, so cutting it down on both pages makes senses if we wish to be consistent. Previously, we wanted to be more specific due to a lack of precedence on how to handle certain questions (current and prospective). The original intent of having all those points was to have an easily accessible place to refer to certain (recurring) meta topic discussions (w/o having to dig through search).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Other anime sites on the internet already had a certain culture which clashes very strongly with the Stack Exchange principles, which is probably why we have to be such fun-hating soup nazis to keep the site up to standard--we're trying to go against an entrenched culture of "anything goes". While it does seem that some of these items have outlived their usefulness, I don't think we should be afraid of making it very clear to new users that we have strong standards, and that if they can't live with those, they should go somewhere else.


















Personally I think there's no real harm having many off-topic rules in the tour page. That's what that section is there for - a broad overview on what's off topic. If I was a new user I'd probably scan there before asking my question if I knew it existed.

That being said I think we can remove:


Questions about the gameplay of anime-related and/or manga-related games
Asking for the lyrics of a piece of music
Questions about fansubs or other fan-translations: When is X group going to do Y release for Z series in Q language? (this falls into illegal copyrighted information anyway)
Shopping recommendations/discussions (mostly because it's not super clear which questions are acceptable and which aren't to new users viewing the page)


And in regards to:


Anything not directly related to anime and manga: What's up with that weird emblem on Japanese mailboxes? 


This could be used as an encompassing rule for the Japanese language reason above.


Questions calling for out-of-universe lists: What are all the anime that feature X? What are all the manga by Y? See: Good List vs. Bad List and How do we deal with out-of-universe questions?


I've never been fond of this phrasing, but I think it's definitely one we should keep.


Reading or watching recommendations: I liked X, what should I watch next? 


Stay


Questions requesting illegal or copyrighted information: Where can I watch anime X online? Where can I download chapters of manga Y?


Stay


Questions about unannounced/speculative future events in regard to anime or manga production: Will manga X get an anime adaptation? Are they going to make a Nth season of Y anime? See: What do we do with questions about future events/releases?


Stay



So, actually, it seems I'm only opposed to the 'making your own anime or manga' one being removed. I think this is an important one to keep.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A off-topic reason for "making your own anime" was one of our first close reasons when we got started. While there have been a few that cropped up, they've since died down. The "anything not directly related to anime and manga" is an attempt to deter specific Japanese culture centric question that watching anime don't understand. The line admittedly is thin, but it's supposed to note that if you take out anime or manga from and the question still makes sense, it's probably off-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ I think it's still relevant though, whereas the other reasons get nearly no questions or have become unneeded or are unclear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Anything not directly related to anime and manga: What's up with that weird emblem on Japanese mailboxes?` The out-of-universe list close reason does not (and is not meant to) cover this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I phrased that badly, I meant that Japanese Language questions can fall under the 'anything not directly related to anime & manga' rule


















In light of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/23280/is-toyosato-elementary-school-open-to-visitorsthis question, which asks about the availablity of a real life location that was used as a setting for an anime. I'd like to ask if we should start including travel and location specific questions related to anime and manga. 

Currently we already have a few questions about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20214/is-the-location-of-a-bridge-to-the-starry-skies-hoshizora-e-kakaru-hashi-a-rreal life locations in anime/manga. Do we want to expand our scope to allow for questions on real life locations of places that appear or are related to anime. Such as what exclusive things can you get in the http://www.pokemon.co.jp/gp/pokecen/english/Pokemon Centers in Tokyo? Or what things can you do at the https://youtu.be/gy1bDt1fQjEAttack on Titan or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5BeaQiMsGMEvangelion attraction in Universal Studios Japan in Osaka. 

Questions such as those would probably fall under the a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tourismtourism (or otherwise appropriate tag [up to the community]) meta tag. We will have a bit of overlap with Travel.SE, but as we do have a few community members that have been to Japan and could share with a a bit of their expertise. I think it would be worthwhile. Additionally, it would allow us to expand out diversity of questions beyond just anime and manga series. 

Of course we'll also have to figure where to draw the lines with these types of question (we don't necessarily want question like what show to I get to X site via Y means of transportation). What do you guys think? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we include anime and manga related travel/tourism questions in our scope?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about questions concerning anime conventions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Frosteeze we have a conventions tag alreadyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say that gritty logistical questions are more the domain of Travel.SE, but "high-level" questions like "is Toyogasaki open to the public" or "what $movie memorabilia are showcased at the Ghibli museum" should be welcome here (I imagine Travel.SE would be fine with them too, but we probably have more expertise over here). I think this will be a bit difficult to formalize until we get more anime-travel-related questions, though.


















I saw some, if not many, in (what seems like) unanswered question from https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag, where someone replied with a title that they saw fit the asker's description. Some of it ended with the question resolved in the question's comment: where turned out it's the right answer, asker (being a newbie like me, that doesn't really understand how the site works) said 'thanks! that's it!', and done, leaving the question status itself remained unresolved. And then me, seeing from the list of questions page, opened it thinking it hasn't been answered, only to find that actually it has its answer in comment. 


Why don't they answer that immediately, back it up with the things they know fit the description? 
Is it because if it's wrong, it feels futile or what? But if that's so, it feels as if it's degrading other people who had tried to answer, posted it, but turned out their answer not the one OP (Original Poster/Asker) searching for. 
Or, is this really an encouraged behavior: "confirm it first through comment, then make it an answer is it's certified to be true"? Eventhough it may lead to "answered but not resolved" question? 


If so, since I like trying to answer https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question, when later I wanna try answering a question, I'd just make a comment. More convenient, I can put one-liner and people won't rant about it being one-liner.    

This ain't sarcasm (in case someone thinks so), since https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22908/what-manga-is-this-recruitment-page-of-a-scanlation-group-from/23311#23311in this question I was told I don't understand how this site works, thus I tried to see how it works. At first I was kinda so sure that behavior wasn't good since it leads to what I've said above, but then since I saw it's done by high-score users too, so I thought "Oh, maybe it's encouraged, just my not knowing that".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is answering in Question's comment an encouraged behavior?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I put discussion tag only because it told me to use one of the tags it mentioned. I don't know whether it's a discussion or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If either of the posted answers answered your question, you can accept it by clicking the check mark under the voting buttons. Otherwise, let us know in comments if anything is still confusing or unclear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't speak for everyone, but when I know the answer but don't have time to write a proper answer, I just write the answer as a one-liner in the comments instead. Additionally, I don't really need any more rep, so a newer user could use this to write a proper answer and gain some rep if they want.


















All the following numbers are as of today’s date (July 21st, 2015).

We currently have a grand total of 1,593 undeleted questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request. 

Of these, 1,246 were asked by their owners as their first post, and 1,212 were tagged exclusively with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request1. 

This means that 347 of our currently undeleted questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request were asked by users who had previously contributed to the site in other tags. Furthermore, there were an additional 321 questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request which were first questions, and were subsequently deleted (11 of which had other tags too)2. 

To put it in percentages, approximately 76.1% of the undeleted https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions were a user’s first question (tagged only with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request), which means:

1 The 34 questions that had other tags will be discarded from here on, since I’m trying to find questions that were about identifying an anime or manga for sure, and not to identify a piece of music or a certain reference of some kind in other anime or manga.  

2 I’ve discarded the deleted questions because some of them are spam or nonsense, so it would only create some noise on the rest of the numbers. As such, I decided to only take into consideration questions that have not been deleted as of this time.  

3 Missing 7 users because these were deleted users, or users who didn’t have an account here an whose question was migrated here, etc.

4 Percentages aren't exactly 100% due to rounding.

5 See https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/92006/208518this Meta post for more info on what abandoned, abandoned closed and dead questions are.

6 "Total" here meaning the 310 deleted questions that were a user's first post, tagged only with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request.

7 Removed along with a user who had been just created to post that question, but then self-deleted their account.

8 The informed badge is earned when users scroll through the https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourtour page. Used here to try to understand how many of these users have actually tried to find out how our site works before asking a question. For reference, 684 (8.3%) of our total users have this badge — which means those users actually don't fall too far from the overall average.

Now I have 92 answers and 19 questions desu.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm interesting in the trends of some of these. How big a part of the total number of questions were [tag:identification-request] questions over time?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd be interested to see the min, max, mean, and median scores for all other questions for comparison. A mean of 2.5 and median of 2 seems very low, but questions on this site also seem to score lower in general than questions on other sites, probably due to our small size and the widely dispersed expertise of our users (e.g. I have no idea how to judge if a Naruto question is good or not unless it's flagrantly bad, so I don't vote on them. If it's bad enough that I know what to do with it, it probably needs to be closed or flagged for moderator attention). It would be interesting to know...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...whether those stats are actually unusually low by our site's standards.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha Cumulative id-requests over time: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261651/the-identification-requests-are-taking-over-cumulative?TagName=identification-request#graph / id-requests in each 2-week period: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261652/the-identification-requests-are-taking-over-averaged-instantaneous?TagName=identification-request#graph (Summary: the identification requests are, indeed, taking over. Since this is from SEDE, it excludes deleted posts, but the fraction of deleted id-reqs vs. non-id-reqs is even worse - 400/1103 deleted Qs are id-req.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/339074/aggregate-stats-for-non-id-requests (Summary: in aggregate, ID requests get about half the score of non-ID-requests.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(See also: queries linked from http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/1193/)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin Would you add the data from the queries on a new answer, or edit them into my answer? It would provide some better readability, and we'd have the results regarding a particular date, and not ever changing whenever we run the query again.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Sure; I'll probably get around to that (plus some other related queries) tomorrow or so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin Awesome. I was mostly concerned with the impact of id-reqs that were posted as a user's first post — meaning I was trying to find out trends regarding users that came to us to have an anime or manga identified (do they further contribute to the site?, do they still visit the site afterwards?, how are these first posts scored?, how many of these have been deleted?, ...).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I find the numbers that @senshin provided on the scores of non-id requests to be extremely interesting. While every meta post we've had on the matter suggests our community likes the idea of having id requests, the voting stats suggest that our community doesn't like most of the actual id requests that we get.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is some great information. Is there any possibility you could share some of the SEDE queries you presumably used to gather all this info?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChristianRau Unfortunately I can't share these, no — they were run in our internal SEDE, where a lot more information that is not shared in the public SEDE is present. For instance, many dates are reset to midnight of the day they refer to on the public SEDE; deletion reasons are also not present in the public SEDE. All the rest should be pretty easy to get from SEDE, though (though, again, I don't have the queries to share as I ran them on the internal SEDE and some parameters' names are different too, and the schema is slightly different).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat did take into account users, who were already on other sites active and just created the account here for an identification request? that was the case with me, i already had some experience with scifi, german and history, and i wanted to know the name of a manga, so i came here. since then, i try to help where i can xD so was the data about account creation about network account or site account?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Site account, @Armin. I didn't look into whether the users were already active elsewhere in the network or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat ah, maybe I'll write something that investigates that as well


















We see them a lot. "I saw it when I was a kid", "I saw it when I was 10", these vague descriptions say a lot, and tell nothing.

A very primitive search ([tag:identification-request] "when i was") shows 68 questions with that phrase, that's not counting things like "My brother watched it when he was 5" or even the more complex things like "I watched it with my brother when my brother was 5", but I think it's a start.

Using this phrase along with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request would trigger the system to display something like this (along with the "Your question couldn't be submitted. Please see the errors above." message):


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we blacklist the phrase "When I was" when asked on an identification request?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that would be a great idea, but I'm not sure how to enforce it. While I'm starting to come around to the idea of banning id requests, if we are going to allow them, it seems overly draconian to close questions because they contain this specific phrase. And such vague questions are likely to be downvoted anyway, even without a policy of downvoting any question containing that phrase.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it's not about closing them, it's about not letting users post if the question body contains this silly phraseb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This phrase isn't useful in questions, it just depends on the person and we don't know this person so I would suggest to put it on the blacklist :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Do you mean we could set up the software to disable the "Submit" button and pop up a warning if it detects "when i was" in the question? I didn't realize that was possible. Like I said, I'm somewhat in favor of banning id requests altogether, so I'd be in favor of that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it's already in place, but for inappropriate words and phrases, some of which you can't also post in comments toob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How would we handle cases like someone writing "When I was 10, on December 3rd, 1997, I saw this anime..." or "When I was watching the SciFi Channel in late 2001, this anime came on..."? Does the software do something smarter than a plain regex search? Too bad we can't train a neural net or a Naive Bayes classifier to filter out lousy id requests, the way spam filters find spam.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda Tell him to drop the "When I was 10". "On December 3rd 1997" is plenty of info. The exact regex is probably to be tweaked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, yes, let's put more lipstick on the pig.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that this is quite annoying, but I don't know if a blacklist is the right solution. False positives will always be a problem with any blacklist (for example "I watched this anime on Portuguese TV when I was visiting Brazil in 2010"), and ultimately we're talking about a small number of questions (~1 per week). Furthermore, this is symptomatic of a bigger problem, namely that the OP doesn't know how to ask a good question; we'll probably still have work to do even when they edit this out. Thus, I'm not so sure a blacklist is better than just dealing with these as they appear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The example you placed isn't a false positive. "When I was visiting Brazil" is redundant information. "I watched this anime on Portuguese TV in 2010" is plenty.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha False. Knowing that the show was dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese and aired in 2000 is all useful. The answer might very well be different if the show was airing on Portuguese TV as opposed to Brazilian TV. More to the point, I can easily come up with  hundreds of other false positives matching the phrase "when I was" since it's a very generic phrase that can precede any number of grammatical constructs including adjectives, nouns, and verbs. You can't hope to distinguish the bad ones purely syntactically based on regular expressions with such a context-dependent phrase.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In any case, if you don't like that one for whatever reason, you may at your leisure substitute "Portuguese" and "Brazil" for "English" and "India"; surely that has no redundant information and is still a plausible scenario.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, it's worth pointing out that looking through the questions your search brings up, it seems like many (most?) of them also include a more useful date information, either in relative terms ("7-8 years ago") or absolute terms ("late 80s"). Yes, it's redundant in these cases to include "when I was younger" but beyond that redundancy (which can easily be removed by hand in a few seconds) it isn't really problematic.


















Thanks @JNat for the data, here are some graphs to visualize this information better.
Notes:

I'm going to refer to "Users whose first post was a (currently undeleted) identification-request question" as ID-Users during this post.
Curve graphs are smoothed.
I'm listing some observations too, hopefully being unbiased.

Percentage of ID Requests
https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoEH6.png

Id Requests are just over a quarter of all undeleted questions

How many of the ID-User's First Questions are deleted?

When Are ID-Users Accounts made?
https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJOvH.png
https://i.stack.imgur.com/kiJnR.png

Most Users accounts are created at the same time as the question is asked. Or at least, in the same day.

When do ID-Users visit after asking their question?
https://i.stack.imgur.com/v6u24.png
https://i.stack.imgur.com/llHlV.png

There's a big dip between 1hr and 24hrs. Do we have a split of ask-and-run users and users who genuinely care about their question?
The majority of users don't care enough to visit again, but there are also users who have revisited the site later.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hispd.png

A lot of users only ask one question, Some ask another, but less than 10% ask more than that. @JNat points a 20+ user that "has subsequently asked/answered the most questions has 77 answers and 5 questions".

ID_Users with the "Informed" badge
https://i.stack.imgur.com/P49Qq.png

The tour page isn't being read by the majority of users. But as @JNat mentions: 8.3% of our total users have this badge and this isn't too far off this figure - so in general the tour page isn't being read.

If it were true, [this graph](http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261651/?TagName=identification-request#graph), which shows the fraction of questions that are id-reqs over time, would be horizontal, or close to it. But it isn't. To the contrary, there is a strong upwards linear trend (R^2 = 0.98) on the graph. Since regressions are 100% true always, this means the site will be >100% id-reqs by 2022 or so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko: I must admit to having done that on some other sites before, although that's half because I generally spend enough time lurking to have an idea of what's on/off-topic and of how SE works, and because I know doing that will give me a badge.


















Thanks to @Hakase and @Madara for answering my questions about how this would be implemented. Since I haven't totally made up my mind on the specific issue of using the phrase blacklist, I'll summarize the pros and cons as I see them.

I'm still wishy-washy on the subject, but I'm leaning towards supporting the end of id requests altogether. @senshin summarized the response to this proposal from that point of view in a comment:


  Ah, yes, let's put more lipstick on the pig.


Movies and TV apparently has also gotten sick of id requests; when they had the initial discussion about whether to allow them, https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/a/75Robert Cartaino posted an answer saying they would regret it. On January 6th of 2015, Movies and TV moderator Napoleon Wilson posted this comment on the answer:


  Oh my, how right you were with all of this, if we just had listened to
  you back then.


Arqade has apparently decided to https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2674ban id requests on their site.

Using the phrase blacklist would just be a very small solution to a very small part of the rather large problem of lousy id requests. On the other hand, there seems to be widespread disagreement among the community on whether allowing id requests is a net positive or not. I can certainly see some negative aspects to getting rid of them, but it seems like when you need a custom close reason that only applies to one specific tag, that tag is a problem.

Coming at this from the other side, we already get https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2316/7579complaints that we're unfriendly to new users. Imagine being a new user, possibly with subpar English skills; coming to post an id request; writing "when I was 10" in your question; and having the system itself pop up a message complaining about how bad your question is. It's like those password checkers that reject all your passwords—"this one doesn't have any uppercase letters", "this one doesn't have any special characters", "this one is too short", "this one is too long", "this one only has 25 bits of entropy, which according to information theoretic principles implies it can be cracked by a determined attacker in 3.23144153 minutes"...this site is supposed to be fun. Personally, I think we can do without a lot of these users posting id requests, but this could be annoying even to users who approach in good faith, read the FAQs and the tour, and do their best to post a good question. 

I also still have some concerns that the system is too coarse-grained. If we're just doing a simple regex search, I'm not sure we can avoid false positives effectively enough to make sure this feature stays out of the way for most users and only affects users who really are writing an awful, vague id request. I think a lot of what Paul Graham writes in the first section of his http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.htmlessay on spam filtering is applicable here: using a regex-based filter like this is similar to using a spam filter that looks for "DEAR FRIEND!!!!!!!" in the subject line. It's us trying to identify what we think are the relevant features of bad id requests. Users who are really determined will find new and wonderful ways to be totally vague and unhelpful, while users who are actually trying may just be disgusted and put off that they're being called out for using a common English phrase. Some of them may find their way to meta to find out what they can do about this, but many more will probably just go "Jerks" and go off to some other anime site. Like I said, I don't know how much we really need these users, but it's something to consider.

On the other hand...jeez, every fricking person who writes an id request uses exactly the same vague, totally unhelpful wording, as if we know how old they are and thus what year it was when they were ten! Maybe it has something to do with the fact that user profiles used to display your age; maybe they thought people could just click over to their profiles and do the calculations. It's clearly not a good use of anyone's time, especially our moderators', to go through every single id request and post a comment saying "Can you please give an exact year? We don't know when you were 10, you see, as we don't know you, and can't even guess how old you are since you've put a picture of an anime character as your avatar."

Maybe we could try doing a test run. Set up the filter and have it on for a few months. After a few months, come back and look at the crop of id requests posted in that timeframe to see if there was any improvement, however marginal, using a set of statistics like the ones in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2467/7579JNat's meta post. After all, if we have the filter in place, then many of the people using this phrase will likely either write better questions, or give up and go away. Whatever happens, we can use the statistics to find out what effect the filter is having and talk about whether we can live with that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I highly doubt the filter will do anything useful. In any case, it isn't cheap to test: I can't easily create a blacklist that only applies to questions (not answers) and only applies when a particular tag is present - that means [lots of false positives](http://anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22when+I+was%22). I wholeheartedly agree with the *rest* of your answer though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shog9 Ah, I was too ignorant of the software to realize that. If the filter is going to reject anything like the number of posts on your link, I don't think it's worth it. We'd do better to ban id reqs or make our peace with asking for clarification on every one.


















The answer to that is that we can't. From the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2467/can-we-get-some-more-definitive-numbers-on-identification-request-statsstats provided by JNat, we see that a overwhelming number of new users don't bother going though the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/tourtour page to see what our site is about. Instead, they treat us as if we're just any other web forum and do as they post what they want expecting the work to be done by the time they return. While we can't force them to listen and stop them from asking, we need to remind them that if they want to ask something here, they need to at least follow our follow our guidelines.

We have a right to refuse questions if they don't comply. We're not here because we have to, we're here because we want to help. Let them know that it's not alright to take advantage of those giving you help.

What are the guidelines suppose to mean to you?

The guidelines for writing good identification question were originally intended to help new and old users alike in both writing and determining the appropriateness of whether an id-req has enough information to be answered or not. Since the intent is not clear, I will acknowledge my shortcomings here and go over our guidelines as they are now and more clearly articulate my original intent:


  An https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request should have as many of the following points as possible:


The intent here is to tell users, while there is a minimum number, often times the bare minimum is not enough. Often times people's memories of the past get jumbled up, sometimes what they recall is completely different from what it is in actuality. This is one of the reasons why nostalgic games of the past are never as good as you imagined it to be. So the more details you have the more opportunities there are to connect dots, in case one is a red herring. 


  
  Any description of the leading/recurring character(s) (i.e. physical description, behavior, etc.)
  


Often times the main protagonist character is (or should be) the most distinguishable character from the series, so outline key points that make him stand out can be an important clue. Just saying he's in his teens, has spiky colored hair does little to distinguish him from the common tropes and clichés in anime. Let's say he has a big sword, if you can't remember any features about it, describe what you remember them doing with it, or how they got it. 


  
  Any description of any distinctive features, including the plot and related elements (e.g. girls who are soda cans that do battle, or i.e., the setting, the plot)
  


Like describing the character, describing the details of a chapter, episode, arc, or overall plot points such as the protagonist getting summoned to another world, getting tangled and blamed for some conspiracy, and ending up having to buy a slave because he can't fight for himself, gives people an idea of how things start off.


  
  What the genre or cinematic style was (e.g. mecha, sci-fi, fantasy, shonen, shoujo, seinen, noir, cyberpunk, etc.)
  


Sometimes genres overlap, such as a mahou shoujo anime. Despite having an all female cast doing girly things, an anime can actually be a shonen action anime. Genre types also help describe the setting without needing to remember too many specific details and is often times a good secondary hint in locating a piece of media. 


  
  What the drawing/animation style is like
  


While not helpful all of the time, this point is intended to serve as a test for the asker to see if they can tell distinguish difference between certain anime or manga. The primary intent is to differentiate older anime from newer anime, but sometimes since the character design archetypes are (for a lack of a better word) recycled, it is possible to narrow things down to the studio or artist.


  
  When and where you saw it (if you saw it when you were a kid, don't give your age, give the approximate year, and month if possible)
  


Because anime and manga fans come in different ages, their idea of anime can be very different. With anime being available all around the word, not every country has been exposed to the same things. Some anime might have only made an appearance during one time and place with not making one in another place (like how Doraemon was localized in many other Asian countries and select European countries prior to 2000, but not the US).


  
  Who the publisher, licensor, and/or distributor was
  


Often times knowing who published, distributed, or broadcast a show can narrow it down greatly, especially if it's outside Japan, because the number of licenses for anime and manga outside of Japan is drastically lower than those in the US. 


  
  Type of media: TV show, OVA, movie, manga, web-series, one-shot, etc.
  


This point is supposed to test if the asker can properly recall what they are talking about. If they can't distinguish whether or not what they are looking for is a manga or anime first and foremost (even if both adaptation exist), it's a sign that they don't remember things clearly should call into question the other details the asker provides.


  
  Any image(s), audio, or video(s) related to the series (an exception may be made for questions with one or more of these items)
  


It's true that pictures speak more than words. However not all pictures are created equal. Bad low resolution pictures, videos, or audio can be just as bad if not worse than having none at all, as there's the potential for misinterpretation by overanalyzing (e.g., clouds are still just clouds, no matter what you imagine them to be like). However, including a picture along should only count as a point and not be an excuse: it should not take the place of any of the abovementioned points as well, regardless of whether or not they fulfil those points. More points are always better.


  All https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions should have a title that is phrased or edited to be phrased as a question containing at least one pertinent detail from the body of the question. Vague title like "Requesting an anime identification" or "What is this anime show?" will lower the visibility of your question by fellow users since they'll have to click on it to find out what it's about.


Many people don't pay much attention to subject titles, for one reason or another. However, for those that to realize their importance, they will know that they are an important segue into the body of a question. Many people won't bother or are not willing to look inside a box without any indication of it's contents. Why should you, as a user of this site, bother looking at the question if the title gives you no idea of whether it's something you even want to answer?


  Please limit your https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions to ask for only one series or piece per question.


This is pretty self explanatory, having too many unrelated questions in one post reduces the chance that all of them can be answered by someone in one answer. Just as if you ask someone a question, you have to give it to them one by one or risk overwhelming the answerer. 


  If the question have less than three (two for questions that include image(s), audio, and/or video(s)) of the the above mentioned criteria, or if the description provided is deemed to be too ambiguous, it will be put on hold as "Off-Topic: This identification request contains too little detail to be answered." You should edit your question to add more details, before it can be reopened.    


This criteria is intended to gauge the amount of effort a user puts into a question. The intent is to tell new users that ask id-req question that you only get as much as you put in. For other observing users it's intended to ask them: has this poster fulfilled the bare minimum to ask a question? If so do you think it's enough? 

Explaining it all like this would have been lot of reading, so an attempt was made to consolidate them into a shorter and more readable format. 

Well, what should we do then?

Ideally I would like those users to treat these question something they would ask of themselves. 

Going forward I would like our users to consider to and act as the following: 


If a question establishes are the bare minimum for id-reqs, think to yourself: are the points they used to describe what's on the tip of their tongue, unique and distinguishable enough to you as a person (not other potentially more knowledgeable)? 


If so, leave it as is if you can't answer it. 
If it is and you're interested in it in hopes of that it getting answer, upvote it so it gets more visibility and start it if you want to come back to it later.
If not, then cast a close vote. The faster the community lets them know that they didn't give us enough to work with, the faster they know that they need to make changes. https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2467/can-we-get-some-more-definitive-numbers-on-identification-request-statsReasearch shows that in general, iq-req asker only stick around for about an hour after the post is posted and some back between a day and a week later.
If you're unsure, consider closing it anyway. If you are unsure, others could feel the same way and be more reluctant to answer. While there is no notification to a user that their question has been closed, the notion is still https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/93842/send-authors-an-inbox-message-if-their-question-gets-closedunder consideration. While this may seem like an unfair double standard, if we wait too long to let users know that their question doesn't have enough information to be answered, more are likely to popup. They might think, oh if no one is taking action against it, it might be alright to ask more of it. I would like to avoid this as much as possible.

If an answer to an id-req question is just a one-liner and/or a link 


Without offering any distinct explanation of why, consider flagging it as "not an answer." 
If there is an answer in it seems to be what the OP is talking about, even if it's the OP answers it themselves, feel free to flag the answer as "not an answer" and write a better one for yourself. You'll probably get more rep than the OP's answer.

If a id-req has visual-audio artefact like a image, video, or sound clip, but nothing else descriptive, count it as fulfilling only one point of the guidelines. Consider voting to close that question. 


We need let people know just leaving us with an image and expecting us to do the rest of the work gets them nowhere
Just like homework questions on Math.SE and programming question on SO, the users need to how that they at least made a bit of effort in trying to solve the problem themselves. Their explanation of what they've tried and what it's not can narrow things down as well. 



We need to start showing new users that if they want to get their questions answered and/or gain reputation on our site they need to put in more effort than the bare minimum. If we want to keep id-req questions we need to lead by example telling new users what they should be doing. Nobody likes being told what to do, but at the same time they shouldn't be left to their own devices. We need to lead them down the right track by showing them how it's done.

But I don't care enough about identification-request question to do anything about them

While I can't force you to agree or act on identification question, we can address in another way as well. Stop paying attention and ask other types of questions, there are various topic we've barely or rarely touched upon these days but have in the past.

We can ask about tourism spots related to anime and manga (because Japan), for those interested in learning more or are otherwise curious about.

We can ask more about plot explanations as some stories tend to be more abstract than others. You might learn something new about your favorite anime though another's enthusiastic interpretation of the plot.

We can promote questions about the currently airing anime, as eventually more fans will catch on either after a season has ended or as is progresses.

Even simple general questions that are a given more long-time anime fans, like what and how a question about the differences between OVAs can lead to another about how https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/16728/what-are-ovas-and-how-are-they-different-from-specialsOVA differ from specials and what is the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/9238/is-the-manabi-line-a-correct-way-for-estimating-anime-profit-lossManabi or anime saving line mean? 

Often times newer anime and manga fans aren't familiar with these terminologies and will stumble onto our site thanks to our site's high search rankings. I'd like to find more ways to eventually convert both new users and habitual users to become more regular users to help our community grow.

We can also do some private screening of anime on a weekly to monthly basis (like the LWA Academia showing) on the off chance that you discover some older anime that fits your palette.

There's a lot of possibilities of what we can do if we put our minds together and go about doing them. Any other suggestions and counter proposals are welcome.

[cont'd.]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The amazing answers I've seen on the trope questions (my own ramblings notwithstanding) and the plot questions about twisty shows like Fate and Madoka seem to indicate that questions like these attract the kind of expert users we want, rather than hit and run id requesters. And these questions can also benefit newer fans by explaining the finer points of certain shows or certain genres.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**"Stop paying attention and ask other types of questions"** - +1 for this especially. We've given so much focus to this "issue" that we've totally lost focus of every other part of our site that we should be working to improve and nurture. If we work to improve our non-ID-req questions, then they will take the focus and the fraction of ID-reqs will drop.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By the way, in case the well-being of the site isn't enough motivation for someone, there's a badge called Inquisitive that you get for asking a good question on thirty separate days and maintaining a positive question record. The system chose to track that badge for me, and I found it motivated me to ask more questions and make sure they were interesting and well-formulated.

This may be a bit of a delayed question - it's been a very busy couple of months - but this has nagged at me for a while.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/22142/102This particular question was officially unanswerable until about a week later.

My deleted answer actually identifies what the case likely was.  I say "likely" because at the time, there wasn't enough information to go on.

I personally don't feel like it's fair that this sort of question got a sort of blind pass by the community.  It may be the case that this sort of question falls underneath the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/27/102future events umbrella, but I'd like to make sure.

The main reason I'm bringing this up is that I recall a moderator making a comment along the lines of adding an "authoritative" answer here, but the real issue was that there wasn't an authoritative answer at that moment in time.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is a question that asks about a future event on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was under the impression that the "future events umbrella" was for out-of-universe things like "is there going to be a season 2", and not for in-universe things like the question you linked. What would you propose we do with it? Close it, and then reopen it later once enough information exists to answer the question? That seems like a lot of work for little benefit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose then the real question would be, why would we want it open in the first place?  At the time, the details of the storyline were still being revealed, and no prior explanation had taken place yet.  It would be almost equivalent to wondering if Ichigo's Bankai will change in his upcoming battle.  What's the point of asking it?  No one knows yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who makes the judgment call on whether or not a question is unanswerable at a given point in time? I don't know anything about Naruto, so I can't comment on this particular case, but I can easily imagine scenarios where people who are reading thing X may think that a question is unanswerable, but a person who has also seen side-story Y may in fact know that the answer was revealed in Y. More broadly, I think questions should be closed on their own merits - "What happened to the Tomoe" appears to be a good question, whether or not anyone knew the answer at the time it was posted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If no one knew the answer at the time it was posted, then the entire question devolves into idle speculation.  If there was, in fact, something revealed in a side story, it would have been referenced.  There simply *wasn't* any material that would have revealed what happened, nor was there any material to verify any other claims.  I admit that I too joined in to the idle speculation, but I still take umbrage towards the way the answer was received by moderation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we distinguish between "nobody on this site knew the answer" and "nobody in the world at all anywhere knew the answer"? The Naruto question is apparently of the latter type, while http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/7776/ is probably of the former type - but how can we tell, a priori? Ideally, people would just not engage in idle speculation when they don't know the answer, _irrespective_ of the _reason_ they don't know the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Speculation is fine as long as they have the facts to back them up. Some questions might be unanswerable until we ask the creators directly (sometimes even they don't know or won't reveal them), but like the [cart driver question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/116/was-lelouch-the-person-driving-the-cart-in-the-last-scene-of-code-geass-r2), providing an objective answer based theories are acceptable. You question was converted into a comment because you did no provide enough information to back it up as an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So what I'm getting here is that speculation is OK, so long as it can be backed up with facts.  That's *fine*.  What I'd like to know is, was this question capable of being backed up by anything at the time of its publication?  As a Naruto fan myself, all we knew is that he had the special tomoe, and now he isn't using them.  There wasn't any material to suggest that he had lost it, so I went with the most logical solution.  Was that such a poor answer as to warrant deletion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Again, your answer was *not* deleted. It was *converted* into a [comment](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22142/what-happened-to-the-tomoe-in-sasukes-rinnegan#comment31707_22142). Rather than having a bunch of "maybe this happened" or "I think this happened" answers that don't explain why cluttering up the answer list, wouldn't rather have a more developed answer saying "this is what I think happen and here is why?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I may have misspoken; I am aware that it was converted into a comment.  At the time, though, the *actual* answer was "we don't know".  The later answer was more detailed, which is a huge benefit to us, but even so...allowing the question to be asked in that situation still feels weird to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The idea is that if you're wondering this question, chances are that someone else is, too. What we'd like to attract users wondering the same thing to our site. Sometimes they might bring some insight with their curiosity. It's like having a job posting, you want to leave it up to get ppl's attention. You don't want to put it up only to have it say who filled the position.


















The future events rule is only intended to be a applied to the production and release of on-topic media. In-universe questions about ongoing developments in plot and characters are always welcome even if there are no canonical answers.

As ongoing plot developments will always be a source of discussion amongst fans, so there's no reason to refuse a question or answer (if there are sufficient facts to back them up.)

For answers that cannot be answered, just leave a comment stating so. Until a series or arc ends, or supplemental materials are released, there's no way to give a definitive answer unless it's revealed in the narrative or by the author directly. Answer blindly mentioning "oh we don't know yet" won't help anyone look for answer and since there's no guarantee that the answerer will come back and edit the answer when it's revealed, it's really not a help to anyone. It's better to give an answer that answers the question, that says "we don't know, maybe you should check back later."

When it comes to the inner details and workings behind a production, few are privy to the details. From time to time some of these details get leaked to the public, but without any facts or evidence to back them up, they will remain as rumors. So unless we develop and inside source or precognitive powers questions about future events and release related to anime and manga will be beyond what we can do. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It feels like that this sort of rule allows the site to devolve into idle speculation and rumors - even if there are facts which support one theory over another - which isn't what I think we want.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto not really. That's what downvotes are for. If an answer is poorly supported or baseless speculation, it should be downvoted whether or not a canonical answer exists.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM:  If no canonical answer exists, does it make sense to cast a vote on it at all?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto if you can prove why you believe your answer is correct. Even if there is no official answer,  as long as enough people agree, it can be considered canon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright, I'm starting to come around to this.  Your piece about adding a comment makes sense.  It still feels a bit weird to permit the question outright though since it really can't be answered, even through supposition.  I suppose it takes a bit more practice to discern which questions fall into an answerable pattern then.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto if you have a suggestion on how to better handle situations like there we're more than willing to listen to what you have to say.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ I think the situation calls for SMEs in that particular manga to objectively evaluate the question and determine if it is *reasonably* answerable.  Someone would have to know the intricacies of the series to be able to ascertain its answerability, but it could be a new reason to put a question on hold; adding idle answers isn't going to benefit anyone, which is something I've definitely taken away from this conversation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto I think you might thinking a bit too much into this. If I need to fix a part of my car, I don't necessarily need to know everything about the interior and exterior part of the car. I just need to know enough about the system and that those related to it, to figure out what's wrong. In the realms of anime and manga, we're really a secondary audience. The primary audience for the media is the Japanese fans, more often than not, those fans will have access to various resources that we don't (e.g., magazines, radio shows, blogs etc.). So more often than not they would know more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A good answer is like a skirt, it should be long enough to cover the subject (i.e., focus on what is being asked), but should also be short enough not to give away everything (i.e., don't cover things in excess).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am not content with the general policy (opposite to SF's "Future Work" policy), but I'm glad I found this. Maybe the guidelines should be made more precise that future work is not part of the "future events" guidelineb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How would you prefer it?


















Looking through the list of recently closed questions, I found these 2 questions closed by 5 members of the community:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/23448/what-other-anime-are-referenced-in-the-first-season-of-durararahttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/23448/what-other-anime-are-referenced-in-the-first-season-of-durarara

The user initially asked for all the references in Durarara for all seasons in a different question (can't find the question through the list of closed/deleted posts), which was closed by our moderator krazer with the too broad reason. With the suggestion of krazer to limit the scope of the question to a single season, the user wrote the two questions above.

Are the 2 questions above really too broad? How can we adjust the scope to make them on-topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is acceptable scope for this question which asks for all references in Durarara?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally I don't think it would be that bad with durara. But Imagine somebody asking for the references in the gintama series and other like wise ones. Only within the first 50 episodes would you probably already exceed a 100 series. Maybe a form of Prevailing type of references would do better?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx: Yes, for longer series, it's reasonable to ask them in chunks of X episodes. The thing is, a moderator **has already suggested to narrow down the scope to per season, and the poster also complies with the request**. However, the community still feels it's too broad. I would like to hear the opinion of the close voters, and how they want to narrow the scope of the question down in a reasonable fashion, since in-universe list questions are technically on-topic, as per the latest discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think these questions should have remained open. They seem comparable in scope to [Which anime episodes of Aria correspond to which manga chapters?](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/2249/7579). Granted, it seems I missed the point when I answered that question and it was actually just meant to test some limits and start a discussion, not to really be answered. Still, when I joined the site, the question was open, so I answered it. The chart I made took me about six hours, with the help of some Emacs keyboard macros. I don't know much about Durarara, but...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...it seems like these two questions are of similar scope to the Aria question. If someone comes along who loves Durarara and has a wiki reference and about six free hours, they could probably answer these. It might take a long time (a long, long time) before such a person comes along, but I don't think that's a reason for closing the questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda: You might want to write an answer to this meta question with that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh When I started writing, I wasn't expecting it to get that long, but I'll work it up into an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's fail on status 3 of [list question](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-site?lq=1)

Have a look at [this post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/2472/49) for a better understanding of what are our current guidelines for this type of question, and how you can possibly improve yours to get some answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sympathetic to the idea that you are using this site to help you do your job, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, _per se_. We would never tell somebody on Stack Overflow who asks a work-related question to "be professional" and go somewhere else, provided that their questions were good; that's half the point of the site! The fundamental issue here is that the particular _kinds_ of questions you're asking - identification-requests - inherently suck.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How many cels do you need to identify?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5127 cels need to be identified.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yea, you're wasting your effort and time, get a few representative cels, zip them up, type up a form letter, and track down anime studios and ask for help via a bulk email.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you can probably even just add the links to this site


















Firstly I'd like to say that that's an interesting job and I'm jealous.

But to the main point (most of which has been detailed in the comments by other users);

127 cels is a lot of questions. If you're experiencing blocks it's possibly  because the site has rate-limiting enabled. This is basically to ensure that a user is not asking a lot of low-quality questions or spamming.

The fact that these questions aren't getting many upvotes is additional to this effect. The system probably considers users posting consistently good questions to be not doing any harm.

It might be worth reading these posts: 


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/164899/the-complete-rate-limiting-guideThe complete Rate Limiting guide
https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/asking-rate-limitedRate limitations




You aren't getting many upvotes because the questions have little substance to them and aren't interesting to other users.

Additionally, repeated questions that users aren't fond of tend to acquire downvotes too - and that further leads to blockages and low-visibility of your questions.

This is a community, not a input-output answer box.



If I were in your shoes I think the best course of action is to spread your search amongst other sites such as http://www.reddit.com/r/animesuggest/r/animesuggest , https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/Anime Characters Database, Forums and other sites that deal with these questions also.

>100 Questions on the same topic is not going to be looked upon fondly by any one site due to the change in flow of how the sites work.

TL;DR: The questions you're asking aren't getting any positive feedback from the users of this site so they're not receiving much attention and because of this you're potentially being rate limited. Two options - Spread your search elsewhere or improve the quality of your questions. 

As a side note, If you have an imgur gallery of all the cels - feel free to comment with it below and I can scan through them if you want and see if I recognise any. (Unrelated to the site)

Realistically I don't think most people here are prepared to sit down and identify 127 different cels (many of which seem to be quite obscure).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even most of our oldest users haven't asked that many *questions*, let alone ID-req's. 127 is completely excessive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LindsayWade Please refrain from using offensive language — it doesn't seem to make sense to use it toward the people who you're trying to get help from, in particular, but please refrain from using it against anyone.

The original point of a community wiki post is to encourage editing by members who do not have editing privileges. Most of the punch this feature packed was lost when suggested edits came into play.

Community Wiki answers are a lot more common than questions. So the option was removed to prevent confusion (Note that once you community-wiki a post, you can't undo). So to make a question into a community wiki, you can flag the question for moderator's attention, explain that you want the question to be community wiki and tell us why. A moderator will apply the wiki status for you.

I've recently asked https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/23819/49this question regarding the anime http://myanimelist.net/anime/27911/Anime_de_Wakaru_ShinryounaikaAnime de Wakaru Shinryounaika. I've used the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-wakaru-shinryonaikaanime-wakaru-shinryonaika, since using the full title would go way over the 25 character limit. So I had to cut the "de", which wouldn't be too much of a problem, IMO. However, I also had to cut a "u" from the last word, turning "shinryounaika" into "shinryonaika".

This is probably fine, since we can't do much about the character limit, but I just thought I'd check if anyone know about any shorter version of the tile I'm unaware of — like "oreimo", "watamote", "waramete" and so on — or a better alternative for the tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we tag "Anime de Wakaru Shinryounaika"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What does it translate to? would just "Wakaru Shinryounaika" make sense?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would translate to something like "Psychosomatic medicine can be understood through anime". So "Wakaru Shinryounaika" would mean something like "Understand[ing?] psychosomatic medicine". It could make sense, given that the manga substitutes anime for manga (of course).


















There is no real canon abbreviation, so you have to consider your own.

You have a variety of choices to consider:


Used the abbreviated channel names for the series on http://mental-anime.jp/series domain http://ch.nicovideo.jp/mental-animeNND and https://www.youtube.com/user/mentalanimeprojectYT, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mental-animemental-anime
Take the first and last part, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-shinryounaikaanime-shinryounaika, this makes it distinct enough to be about psychosomatics and anime
Make and use a English abbreviation, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/comical-psychosomaticcomical-psychosomatic


The title is more or less, in a literal sense, "Understand with Anime, Psychosomatic Medicine."

Keeping "psychosomatic" and "anime" together is important. Adding at least an excerpt to the tag wiki (for context) relating it back to the title and synonyms (in case they type "anime de wakaru") will help in recognition by users, too.

Including the title in the body might also help.

'Cause if so, then that wouldn't be an option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think there's a need to worry about question about the manga. Given that we're primarily English site, it makes more sense to use the English names. But due to it being a new series it doesn't have as much exposure as the original in romanized form. It might make more sense to use the English title if you want to be all inclusive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Keep in mind that we can synonym the others (and I think [mental-...] is a good one since some people will type that word in).

Our current prompt for when you ask a question with the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request is this:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/0nDBv.png
Seeing as we don't allow image-only id-requests (see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2473/1530here), maybe we should make it more clear that they need additional details.
If I was a new user and saw this - it doesn't seem to indicate that asking an image-only question is inappropriate, just that it should be reverse-searched beforehand.
I want to open the floor to the possibility of change to this feature.
Would it be good to change to something like:

Are you trying to identify a series?
Try and post as much information as possible - https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2473/1530See here for question requirements

Although this removes the reverse search part of the prompt which isn't great either.
Opinions? Should we change it/leave it? Do you have your own better wording?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5identification-request prompt reworkb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If possible, I think we should combine the current one with your proposal--have a popup that says something like "Trying to id a series? See here for question requirements. Trying to id the subject of an image? Try using Reverse image search first!" Or we could just ban id requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, that last bit is a whole other conversation - but perhaps, the only thing I was worried about was it possibly being quite longb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, that last bit was a pseudo-not-very-funny joke that's sort of serious, which can be ignored for now. I agree it might get a bit long if we include all the necessary caveats. And in the end, any prompt is only useful if people read it. The benefit of your proposed change is that people who do care to read about how to improve their question get a complete reference on how to write a better question, instead of just disconnected advice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also think our new policies on image-only id requests have drastically reduced the problem they pose, so it makes sense to rework the prompt to address the problem of bad id requests more globally.


















I vote in favor of changing the current message.

As https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2472/we-need-to-do-something-about-the-new-users-behind-identification-request-questi/2473#2473We need to do something about the new users behind identification-request questions Also covers the image part in it self.


  If the question have less than three (two for questions that include image(s), audio, and/or video(s)) of the the above mentioned criteria, or if the description provided is deemed to be too ambiguous, it will be put on hold as "Off-Topic: This identification request contains too little detail to be answered." You should edit your question to add more details, before it can be reopened. 


I also think that link to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892What criteria should we use for QCing for ALL "identification-request" questions? instead of the current one, as this is allot shorter. And I am pretty sure that most people are not waiting to read a huge wall of text, especially if they are not even taking the time to provide allot of details in their original question. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 overall, but it seems like image-based requests are a problem in themselves that needs (or needed) a separate solution. Almost none of the posts I've seen that have an image or video are actually saying "Hey, I watched this anime and I have this picture of it, the plot was blah blah...What was the title?" They're usually "Hey, I have this random picture from somewhere, what anime is it from?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's why I think it's still useful to have specific and prominent guidelines for image-based questions, instead of relying on the guidelines that seem to assume images are only used as supporting evidence. There's a gap between the case the guidelines were written for and what actually goes on, which I think new users need to be made aware of.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda Maybe there should indeed come some sort of guidelines for *image only questions* such as providing at least the source where the find it. And a *minimum requirement* of the image such as quality etc. But if were to go in such details then I think going for a Media-identification-request tag would help us out allot. As this could cover audio/video/image identification requests, instead of the generalization of all such.


















Adapted from https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/6450/Scifi.SE's collection thread:


  While you don't have to know the subject matter to be a mod, it often helps. Are there any major tags with which you have little to no experience? What will you do in the event that a questionable flag was made in an area where you have little expertise?


(This is particularly important to our site since a large fraction of our questions comes from long-running shounen series like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/one-pieceone-piece, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fairy-tailfairy-tail, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball, etc. Since all these series inhabit the same genre/demographic, it is very possible that prospective mods who don't like that particular genre/demographic may have no knowledge of these series whatsoever.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 to this. I constantly have trouble in the review queues dealing with Naruto posts--they're often not in great English, and due to my lack of knowledge of the series, I often can't tell if the core ideas of the post make any sense or not. Any moderator will have to deal with lots of these, so that domain knowledge could be very important.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1! At least 2 out of 3 moderators should have a wide range of watched/read titles & genres. **Candidates, please share the range of genres and eras that you're competent in** (for example: “For the past 20 yrs, I’ve watched/read all manner of genres [except hentai & horror], titles from differing decades, representative works of classic mangaka, and [with an open mind] genres I didn’t even expect to like; I’m acquainted with all anime exported to the U.S. up through the year 2000 regardless of genre; and I intentionally tried out just about every manga magazine I could, from...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... _Shounen Sunday_ to _RunRun_ to _josei_ to _seinen_. When I co-founded an anime club, the titles we screened were carefully categorized by genre and time period and then voted upon within those, so as to make sure that no fan went through their college career claiming to be an anime fan without having at least given classic _Gundam_ or _Rose of Versailles_ a try.”) Let us know **how you've educated yourself about the breadth of the artform.** Since shoujo comprises such a major corpus of the realm of anime, I believe that at least 1 of the moderators should be well-versed in it in order…b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... for this SE to move forward in growing into a reputable and authoritative information resource on anime and manga **over-all**: where questions about genres other than the current _JUMP_ shounen series rise in number and quality, where moderators have a general competence regarding the content of many genres, where experts educated in various genres feel comfortable without feeling marginalized or that nobody really cares if they're contributing or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@seijitsu It might make sense to post something like "please share the range of genres/etc" (or whatever question(s) in particular you want to ask) as a separate answer on this post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin per your request and some up votes on my comment, I've separated it out as another answer.


















Site promotion and (new and old) user retention has been an issue we've struggled with since the site's inception. Occasionally, we toss things at the walls to see what sticks, but that's not an effective long-term strategy. 

As a candidate, do you have any prospective (long-term and/or short term) strategies or ideas the deal with this issue (both within and outside of the Stack Exchange community)?   
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So far I haven't heard from anyone discussing this in the Campaign Café what concrete steps you would take. I believe the main reason it’s hard to attract & retain users is that when a fan first looks at the site, either they 1) search for a question as a test (to see if this SE covers the kind of info they're looking for) and navigate away if it doesn't, or 2) thinks it looks interesting as an idea and starts to ask/answer some questions, but finds it difficult to wade through both ID requests and mainstream JUMP shounen requests to find anything they're an expert in (it seems like the ...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5…only way to search is to run a search for each specific title they know well, but that’s tiresome & will likely pull up a lot of "Sorry, we don't actually have any questions so far about that series" results or there's a handful of low-quality questions about that title but the selected answer is often opinion w/o citation and is dead wrong); so they get discouraged because the idea of SE is nice but the reality is that, so far, this SE is **not** comprised of a community of gathered experts in anime & manga. That's not to say there are no experts here at all, but they're few and far in...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5…between, so when a new user who is an hardcore expert in a genre or in specific series browses to see how this SE is handling their area, they realize it would be too hard to try to fight against the numbers of non-experts who are answering questions incorrectly (with higher rep). This is why I don't feel comfortable to invite the shoujo experts I know personally, or any of my Japanese subculture friends living in Japan to join: in the current state, they'd take one look at the classics, shoujo, josei, children's, etc. Q&A offerings and turn away for good. What are your concrete proposals...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5…for handling 1) opinion-based answers that're incorrect but get up voted by other non-experts (in some cases, even over clear, objectively correct answers with ample citations <— this looks very embarrassing to experts considering whether SE is useful & worth investing any time in vs. a hopeless cause) and 2) how to increase the quality & quantity of questions outside of mainstream shounen given the demographic of users we currently have? If you’re not personally very knowledgeable about titles from other genres/decades than your favorite ones, how would you concretely counter the status quo?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@seijitsu these are good questions and points to bring up, however this meta is for general questions, not a Q&A for a candidate. If you want to discuss all of these in detail, I'll be more than happy to do so in chat at a time per your convenience.

there are a few issues (most obviously id-requests, but there are definitely other items) that some potential moderators will have a strong stance on. I think this situation may arise depending on who is voted in.

A variant on this question that I'd more like to hear answered is "The other moderators are heavily pushing a new change to the site policy and you personally agree with them, but the community itself is split on the issue. How do you deal with this situation?" In other words, "As an elected representative, should your actions strive to reflect the wishes of the community, or were you entrusted by the community to act against the majority consensus at times for the sake of the greater good?" and "How would you attempt to change policy if others are split on the matter?"



















With A&M, there has occasionally been a tendency for some posts on Meta to fade into obscurity and be forgotten / never dealt with.
Also, our meta policies are scattered among many Meta posts from various dates, making it hard for users to know what is current.
Do you feel this is an issue? How would you deal with this?

The amount of meta duplication recently has been pretty absurd, and it seems like no one even remembers any of the old discussions, instead trying to re-solve the same problems we've already solved...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's made meta essentially unusable except to the few people who have followed everything from day 1. Instead we end up with unclear policies and people trying to wing every decision. Going forward, I hope to see more duplicates marked as such and more meta awareness in moderation (both from mods and non-mods), and I hope the newly elected mods will be able to aid in this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM If you want to mark some things as duplicate, you could just do that. I, at least, check the meta review queues every so often and would be able to finalize any duplicate closures you trigger.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin When I notice duplicates in the future, I will try to mark them. Unfortunately, I'm not on the site as much as I used to be, and often by the time I see the post it's already been around for several days and sparked some discussion. Moderators get notified of new meta posts immediately, and are thus in a strong position to act unilaterally, assuming they themselves are familiar with meta. With all that said, duplication is just one symptom of the general disorganization of meta, and not necessarily the most problematic one.


















Power users who enjoy posting the most questions and answers don't simply equate to being the same people who are best-suited to routine, unthanked, humdrum administrative tasks.  What experience (other than your contributions on this SE) do you bring to the table that demonstrates your competence as a moderator/admin?

Some ideas to share with us: in your job, internship, volunteering, club/org, website/forum/mailing list/social media, have you


performed repetitive administrative tasks... and enjoyed it?
organized and categorized material?
copyedited others' writing?
provided customer service?
fielded questions about rules and protocols?
moderated heated disputes? 
handled a person who didn't care about following the guidelines?
had to delete offensive content or ban a user?
avoided making top-down decisions even when you had the power to do so, instead opting to return some decisions to voting by the members at large?

It's exactly why I wouldn't consider running for moderator myself--I help out in the review queues, but I don't particularly enjoy it, and I'll occasionally try to engage with a user whose content is below par, but I don't particularly enjoy that either. That's the bread and butter for a moderator.


















What should responsible moderators not do with their power? What behavior have you disliked in moderators (on any SE or elsewhere) that you vow you'll never do?

A particular series tag / type of question seems to attract one-line answers.
How would you encourage users to give more detail than just a single sentence / link?

Similarly for attracting one-line questions.

The answers to some sorts of questions ("what is the name of this thing", e.g.) are inherently short; this doesn't necessarily make them bad. Likewise, though some one-line questions happen to be bad, one-line questions aren't _inherently_ bad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin I'm not saying that all one-line things are bad, but I think from the context of my question you can assume that the items in question are not particularly useful, even if they are correctb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, that's fine - I'm more just suggesting that it's going to be difficult to answer this question with much more than "Well, it depends on...".


















Recently, we've had two questions on Avatar: The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra which garnered close votes: https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/24013/7579Is avatar Korra bisexual? and https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/19921/2604How can fans be used to augment earthbending?. The first question has yet to receive the fifth vote necessary to close it. The second was closed, but later reopened. Looking at the https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/19921/revisionsedit history, the intersection of the group that voted to close and the group that voted to reopen is empty—so we had five users who thought the question was off-topic, and another five who thought it was on-topic. All ten of the users who voted on this are respected, high-rep users with lots of good contributions to the site, which suggests there is a pretty deep gulf over this issue in the community.

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/415/7579A previous meta post established that peripheral topics like Last Airbender, Korra, and RWBY are on-topic here, as well as allowing manhwa, manhua, original English language manga, and certain video games. This ruling was reinforced in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/840/7579another meta post on RWBY specifically, and in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2385/7579this duplicate of the first post. However, some users evidently were either not aware of these posts, or disagreed with them, and have been voting to close Last Airbender and Korra questions.

Do we still want to accept questions on these shows?

I do not want to start another argument about whether these two shows are anime or not. To me, they are not anime under the commonly understood definition in the non-Japanese fandom. To me, any work in which the vast majority of the creative direction comes from non-Japanese sources is not anime. However, Final Fantasy is also not anime, and we allow Final Fantasy questions, so not being anime is not an automatic disqualification. We can argue in circles about whether the shows qualify as anime under someone's definition, but it never goes anywhere. Let's try to focus on practical policy instead of arguing over definitions and gut feelings.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we still want to field questions on non-Japanese anime-inspired works?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[somewhat](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/1/is-animation-or-comics-inspired-by-japanese-culture-or-styles-considered-on-topi) [related](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/157/how-is-anime-defined)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I feel gets missed in most of the answers on the discussions that @Hakase linked to is creative control. People argue about whether something is Japanese if it's animated by a Japanese studio, or if some anime are actually Korean because they're animated by Korean studios, but in most cases it's not hard to decide who was actually exercising creative volition in the making of a specific work. For Last Airbender, those people were American; for My Neighbor Totoro, those people were Japanese. To me, it's only anime in the latter case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm seeing lots of downvoting on the answers here. Downvoters: please add comments or new answers explaining what you disagree with and what your preferred solution would be. This is a very controversial issue, so we need as much community input as possible, otherwise we'll continue to have a divided community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've posted a community wiki answer which details what I perceive as the consensus on this issue. Please edit to make it more clear as you find necessary, and upvote it if the policy and philosophy it lays out seems reasonable.


















I personally see nothing wrong with prohibiting these questions here, since all three still have a home on SF&F (all three series in question are fantasy, and AtLA/Korra in particular have a much larger userbase over there) and AtLA/Korra also are certainly welcome on M&TV (dunno about RWBY). 

I am well aware that SE sites need not have mutually exclusive domains, but since this particular set of topics is controversial over here and uncontroversial on SF&F/M&TV, I think it makes our lives easier and nobody's lives harder if we just opt to migrate all new non-terrible AtLA/Korra/RWBY questions to SF&F or M&TV, as appropriate. (We can let existing questions be, or maybe just close them if ever they get bumped back to the front page.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this answer in principle, and upvoted it, but it seems like there's community support for allowing these questions here and banning them entirely will cause hard feelings, so we're pretty much damned if we do allow them, and damned if we don't allow them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would you be willing to support the solution that Toshinou Kyouko and I discussed above--officially tolerate these questions, but strongly encourage migration to SF&F, and ask our users who are willing to do review tasks to check SF&F for possible duplicates rather than vote to close? I also think someone (me, if no one else wants to) should make a master list on meta of non-anime topics which are allowed. I know this seems like a lot of trouble, but since we get so few of these questions, it shouldn't end up being too much work to maintain.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda I think the solution you folks discussed is fine (though it does little to prevent the close-reopen wars that are likely to happen if sentiment for/against these questions remains polarized). I don't think it's productive for us over here on Anime.SE to bother checking for possible duplicates on SF&F, though. Either we should let the question stand here, _or_, migrate it to SF&F and let _them_ check for duplicates on their end.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda re: a list of non-anime topics - this would be a thing worth having, though I assume the list you're talking about is really more a list of "Western media topics" or "non-Japanese media topics"  that we permit (since we obviously permit lots of things that aren't anime [manga, LNs, etc.]).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I wanted to do more to end the close/reopen wars, but I suppose in the future we can at least point close-voters at this meta post and the list of allowed topics. My inclination was to lean pretty heavily on askers to accept migration, which might do a little to stop the closure wars.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As far as the list, I was thinking of putting everything that isn't anime or manga: light novels, visual novels, JRPGs, manhua, manhwa, Chinese and Korean animation, and Western anime-style productions. As it is the mandate that allows many of these topics is scattered across several meta posts and it's confusing to find the one you want.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda Oh, that would be even more helpful. But also a lot more work if you want to cover all the corner cases ("anime internet culture", conventions, stuff like that).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point, I didn't think of the internet culture and convention corner cases. Our recent decision to take anime tourism questions would be another corner case. I'll work on a list that at least covers the clearly non-anime or manga stuff that we allow, and maybe community wiki it so other people can add dubious topics (with support from previous meta posts) as they encounter them.


















I'll present my own take on the issue, but I welcome other opinions.

As I said in the question, to me, Last Airbender and Korra are not anime, but this should not mean automatic disqualification. https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2530/7579Toshinou-san's answer presents a good case for why they should be allowed despite not being anime.

Questions on Last Airbender and Legend of Korra are on-topic at Sci Fi and Fantasy Stack Exchange. From looking over their tag list, there are 110 questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avatar-the-last-airbenderavatar-the-last-airbender and 105 questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legend-of-korralegend-of-korra. They're also on-topic on Movies and TV Stack Exchange, with one question each. We won't be leaving anyone out in the cold by refusing these questions.

I think we should encourage anyone who asks a question on these two series here to move their question to Sci-Fi and Fantasy. Although there is definitely crossover in expertise, the majority of Stack Exchange users who are interested in these shows seem to have settled on Sci Fi and Fantasy as their chosen site. As Esq points out in a comment https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/24013/is-avatar-korra-bisexual#comment34644_24013here, it's more important to congregate all the questions in one place than it is to argue philosophy:


  Anyways whatever the choice is I think avatar should not be split up
  into 2 places, all current Q&A should be moved to a single place.
  Consistency is more important than being right in this case


Having all the questions in one place means it's easier to find out if your question has already been asked, and it's easier for answerers to find your question since they don't have to check three different sites. Whether or not you think Avatar is anime, the fact is that most of the questions on the show are on SFF.SE, while most of the questions on Full Metal Alchemist and Dragon Ball Z (which are also on-topic on both sites) are over here.

I'm not sure I favor closing any questions on Last Airbender or Korra. I think if we had never decided to take them, it would have been viable to close them as they come in. But at this point, we've already had a policy of allowing them for a while. And it's probably confusing for people to figure out whether they're allowed or not. I'd rather strongly encourage people to move their questions to SFF, with migration as a possibility. Perhaps we could also migrate all currently open questions on these topics, and make it clear in our tag wiki that the tags should not be used for new questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FYI, questions older than 90 days aren't migratable. So "send them all to SF&F" isn't an option. "Send all the new ones" is, of course.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin Ah, didn't know that. I agree with your answer that we can just leave the old ones alone, then. Possibly we could use the "historical significance" lock on the old questions to show people that we're not taking new questions on these topics.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is migration possible by the user or only by mods?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Esq: I remember being able to flag / vote to close questions for migration. However, migration choices via that route are limited to [a specific set of sites](http://meta.chinese.stackexchange.com/q/444/5714).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyhow, this sounds reasonable. Granted, in the case of some manhua like [McDull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDull), I'd be surprised if I'd get a better response elsewhere (and wouldn't encouage migration, even if I wouldn't encourage asking here because it would seem largely an exercise in disappointment), but at the very least, this sounds like a reasonable approach to Western media.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Esq For the time being, you will have to cast an "in need of moderator intervention" and type in where you want the post to be migrated. Eventually, we may have migration paths elsewhere, though I'd be surprised if we got them to anywhere besides maybe Japanese.SE and Movies.SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ScienceFiction F?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon I see now that the question title can be interpreted to include manhwa and manhua, but I was really just thinking of Last Airbender and Korra and possibly RWBY, since I think those have a better home on SF&F. We *would* be leaving people out in the cold if we banned manhwa and manhua, even if it's not very many people and mostly ID requesters, so I would be much more hesitant to support closure or migration on those questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda: right, I figured that the question was mostly concerned with Western works, because of that problem. Manhua / related content might not be our core expertise anyway, but none of the obvious migration choices are that appealing (e.g. in my example, I could probably ask on Movies.SE, but I would not be surprised if I got no response), so I'd rather leave that issue as it stands for now.


















Personally I think they should be allowed.

These are as tangentally related to our userbase as other non-strictly-anime items that we allow are - like manwha. Clearly the userbase is interested in Avatar questions based on how many votes it got.

As for overlapping content, we have many questions about the plots of games - and there's an entire stack site for that.

I think it is fair enough that questions on works that are commonly associated with anime (even though they may not be) are of value to the community because of this status.

Whilst we shouldn't explicitly encourage these questions, I don't think that they shouldn't belong here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've community-wikid this cuz i'm going to bed nowb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: "there's an entire stack site for that" - Arqade tends to frown on questions about the "plots of games" (what they term "lore questions"). Plot questions will generally be better-received here or at SF&F than at Arqade. The same is not necessarily true of AtLA (as the closure of some of these questions evidences).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin makes a good point: not only do we have a much smaller amount of Last Airbender expertise than SF&F, there's an element of our community which is actively hostile to it. It seems that, no matter how you slice it, these questions are more at home on SF&F, so the question becomes how proactive and forceful we want to be about encouraging people to take their Last Airbender questions to SF&F.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda there are lots of people opposed to id-requests and other types of questions too.
I think they're equally relevant on both sitesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko Personally, I was fine with leaving the policy as it was. I don't have a problem with the overlap. I raised this issue for two reasons: I genuinely think that these questions will get more interest on SF&F, and I don't think it's fair to people who ask these questions that we have an official policy which allows them, but an unofficial cadre of users going around closing them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unlike id requests, which make up a massive fraction of our content, we hardly get any Last Airbender/Korra/RWBY questions, so it seems like we could save everyone a headache by encouraging askers to go to SF&F. It wouldn't be hard to implement and it wouldn't affect that many users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5if we have a better-known policy, which is why this meta post exists, we won't have that cadre of users, so I feel that point is mootb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I forsee that banning the questions could also lead to more subsequent meta posts trying to define if shows are 'anime' or notb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps that's really the problem here: a lot of the time when Last Airbender and Korra get discussed, people spend a bunch of time arguing over whether they're anime or not, and no one ever seems to understand what the other side is saying because the arguments are essentially religious. Thus, when policy decisions get made, certain people feel like they weren't heard, and they ignore the policy. This is the sort of thing that could lead to your fear of more meta posts on defining certain shows as "anime" or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still believe we should encourage people to take their questions to SF&F, but we can do that without banning the questions. Maybe that will be enough to satisfy both sides.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda, I think that would be a good approach

Hence I removed that line in the answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Ah, sorry to hear that Japanese culture didn't make it. Thanks for editing that for me.


















In drafting an answer to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2537/the mod question about user retention, I wrote up a quick query to examine one crude measure of user retention across SE sites: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/351067/http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/351067/. See the description for details. 

By this measure, our user retention is in the gutter, sitting at just under 10%. This is the 12th-worst out of all SE sites. Note, though, that there are many confounding factors (e.g. sites that were founded between 6 and 12 months ago will be inherently skewed; the import of Rus.SE confuses matters; Patents.SE is a special case; etc.). 

I don't know if this is a useful metric (it basically tells us that we get a buttload of one-and-done ID-req askers), but the numbers are there if you want to look at them. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some crude numbers on user retention across SE (which may not be a useful metric at all)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are many factors at play here and I don't think they should be dumped on id-requesters without evidence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko Come on, man. The evidence is there for everyone to see. http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/351089. If we subtract these schmoes out of the numbers, retention (by this measure) spikes to ~16%, which is solidly middle-of-the-road.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wasn't saying they weren't gonna be a contributor, you just  blamed them without backing it up so for all we knew it could have been wrong. Thanks for the query though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Subtract the ID requests though and you cut the number of questions  roughly in half. Taking the site from from barely meeting one of the two current requirements for graduation (10 questions a day) to not even being close. I don't think percentage retained is a good metric of site health. If we assume having more people stick around will result in a better quality site than a better metric would be the absolute number of retained users. It's not clear that banning ID requests would increase the actual number of users that stick around and contribute to the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge Sure, I pretty much agree with you. However, I'll go one step further and argue that absolute number of retained users isn't even that useful either. All said and done, we don't really care about _users_  - we care about _content_. Of course, content is produced by users, so measuring user participation isn't wholly unrelated to measuring content generation, but I think the measures are far enough apart that we can't really infer much about one based on the other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interestingly Arqade has a similar rate, and they're doing pretty well (imo at least)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to agree that this isn't a very useful metric. I've seen users stick around the site for a while who (frankly) I would really rather left, since they produce a steady stream of lousy posts that get downvoted or closed, and won't get the hint when the community offers advice on improving their content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If this means we get alot of casual users, that is good.  If it means they are creating a new account each time with a temporary email, that is neutral (to me).  If it means they aren't coming back because we offend them and/or ignore/close their questions, this metric implies something very bad.  Banning ID requests might discourage users (note: I'm biased as I came here first for an ID request.)


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/24028/sources-for-christian-themes-and-motifs-in-narutoSources for Christian themes and motifs in Naruto?

Looking through the question, it seems like a decent question to me. Asking if there are any sources stating the potential influence of Christianity in Naruto all tough asking discussion groups potentially is on the edge I don't see why this question should receive such a amount of down votes.

Could some of the people that decided to Down vote this particular question elaborate as to why they find this particular question to be bad? Just like https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/1908/senshin@Senshin states in his comment


  This question is the most down voted (non-deleted) post on the site by a large margin, and I don't see why. 

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is wrong with this post, to cause such a massive down vote barrage?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Incidentally, the only deleted post with a score of -11 (this post was at -10 when I commented) is the "Help me identify this baby prenis!" one that I'm not even going to link to because it was so terrible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I honestly don't know either. I didn't upvote it, but I certainly don't see why it's worth of a downvote, let alone 7.


















I didn't downvote it, but the others who did probably did so because there was a wall of text and then a question.

Probably should have put the question up top.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Down voting purely because of that is just plain **wrong**. If seen bigger walls of text, which even managed to receive allot of up votes. All tough I do agree, there could be some TL;DR for the lazy readers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Those walls of text are usually answers. IMO good questions are short, concise, and to the point. There should only be enough detail for context. The whole point of asking a question is usually to get an answer. Why would you self sabotage by asking it in a way that most people don't want to bother with? With that said, downvotting means the question could be improved. I'm guessing the improvement is to make it clear what's being asked for in an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It wasn't a wall of text to begin with. It had garnered at least 4 downvotes before it was [edited into a longer question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/24028/revisions).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Killua interesting, i still think having the question up top would have removed a few of those downvotes


















What is the purpose of Anime.SE?
What kind of people do we want on Anime.SE?

I tried to find a meta post about this but really couldn't find anything.
The site tour says


  Anime and Manga is a question and answer site for enthusiastic anime and manga fans


If we take that at face value, we only want enthusiastic fans, and only questions and answers by and for enthusiastic fans. There has been disagreement with this mindset, though. I think its time that as a community, we clear this up.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What are we here for and who do we want here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Stack Overflow and Programmers have discussions on this issue pretty frequently. Those guys can be mean as hell, especially to people with subpar English. By contrast, I've seen our users try to make sense of almost complete nonsense and edit it into something intelligible just because we don't want to discriminate against new users. (I've even been that user a few times.) Yes, we are more elitist and exclusionary than most anime sites on the net, but by Stack Exchange standards, we're quite friendly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda i understand where you're coming from. To new users, though, they're not gonna know the difference. If our goal is inclusion, how friendly we are relative to other sites doesn't really matter, right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sensing that you and I have pretty major differences in opinion on this topic. I've been in the anime fandom for almost fifteen years, and in all that time I've never been attracted to any of the available fan communities. Recently, I spent some time on Reddit and 4chan doing research for an answer here, and I remembered why--endless threads of "Clannad is forced drama bullsh***tt u sux", "Angel Beats suxxxx", "No u sux", "ur mom sux".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Frankly, I don't want to invite those people to participate here. I think we've struck a pretty decent balance between inclusive and exclusive. No one here vilifies new users like on SO and Programmers, and we're pretty lenient on people with subpar English, but we're also not tolerating the kind of garbage that Reddit and 4chan put up with. If people prefer that kind of atmosphere, I think they should stay there. Let us be an island of civility and intelligent discourse.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If that means we stay small, I think that's okay. I don't think we need to be as big as MAL or ANN. We'll make up for our small size with high-quality content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see where you're coming from. Can you write an answer summarizing your thoughts?


















There are currently three trends I'm seeing:


Questions should be formatted correctly with good grammar
Only questions about an anime/manga/etc should be allowed
If it doesn't follow the site rules, the user is an idiot beyond saving


This would basically translate to professionals who also watch anime are the only people who are welcome on this site, as 1. Even native english speakers have trouble with writing, and 2. Professionals are just about the only people who would bother to go through the manual before doing something.

Considering the dominant demographics of anime/manga fans and the amount of people who are just discovering anime and manga, I believe these are unrealistic and unsustainable expectations.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, perhaps if we were a Japanese-based site, we might expect older users and more localized users. The rest of the world is spread out and immatureb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These attitudes are seen in greater or lesser degree across all of Stack Exchange. I do think they're helpful, in some degree, to maintain the quality of site content. I also think that some sites have gone way too far with them and the high rep users are basically just country club snobs at this point. It's good to check ourselves every so often and make sure we've dialed these traits to the level we want them at.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As to the second point, I made [this meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/2535/7579) as an attempt to satisfy both the people who want to have a broader scope *and* the people who want to have more concrete rules about which topics are allowed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Vogel612 I think you misread my post. I have three points to my post: 1. describing the current trends, 2. what that means in terms of actual audience welcomed, and 3. why its *bad*. I am in now way saying that the trends I'm pointing out is how we should proceed.


















This was implemented, with just a slight change in the first paragraph of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2504/identification-request-prompt-rework/2520#2520ʞɹɐzǝɹ's suggestion, to reduce the amount of text in that little box:

To be frank, I don't really know what you're asking. This is a very broad question and even though you've got two points, they're still pretty generic.


  What is the purpose of Anime.SE?


Simple Answer: To answer and ask questions about Anime & Manga and related topics.

Longer Answer: Stack Exchange sites are whatever you want them to be - they can be social (chat), they can help with things you're confused about and they can be a great resource to learn new information. Do we really need to define and focus on one particular thing?


  What kind of people do we want on Anime.SE?


Simple Answer: We want people who will contribute positively.

Longer Answer: Are we really looking for a particular type of user? We cater for fans of all genres, people who are really into anime and people who only have watched ghibli films.

Anime SE is open to everyone. The only thing we expect is a certain level of basic coherency and a willingness to contribute.

As far as who we want to attract - more experts would be good, but generally active coherent users are what fuels this site. Much of our questions are researchable, so we don't necessarily need hundreds of experts.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Stack Exchange sites are whatever you want them to be" reaaaaally. I never would have guessed. The question is what do *we* want it to be? A lot of the supposed problems could be more readily addressed if we establish whether we want to cater to everyone or just experts. The trend right now is toward experts. Whether we need to define and focus on something is the purpose of the question. IMO, we do need to define, but we don't need to focus.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the kind of people. People who are both active and coherent are probably the minority in the anime world. If these are *only* the kinds of people we are willing to welcome, then so be it. This means that our site will never really grow even close to the MALs and ANNs, which is okay. However, that also means that advertising and retention takes a back seat to kicking everyone else off of the siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see why you want the site to be exclusive - being coherent is basically a threshold we have to avoid questions that are unreadable. I also said that active users are those we want to attract - **not** that other single-time users aren't welcome.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're a Q&A site, we're always going to be somewhat geared towards experts as we need people to answer questions. Without that we would be essentially a forum.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also ANN and MAL are completely different websites which require littke-to-no community interaction if not desired. Whereas questions and answers here pop up to the front page for everyone to seeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The point is that I don't want the site to be exclusive. If you mean coherent as in I can understand what they're trying to communicate even with formatting and grammar issues, then I agree.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While we do need experts, I think we need to attract the questions for experts to answer, first.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, ANN and MAL are totally different sites. When I mention ANN and MAL, I mean name recognition.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ah okay, I presumed you meant as active/interacted with.

You're saying that you don't want the site to be exclusive, but also "A lot of the supposed problems could be more readily addressed if we establish whether we want to cater to everyone or just experts"  and "What kind of people do we want on Anime.SE?" - so this is confusing me.

What sort of problems could be solved? Advertising niches? Deciding whether to allow types of questions? Maybe understanding what outcome you're thinking of might help me see why this should be definedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's putting the cart before the horse. See [Leading Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_question)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well unless I understand the purpose of defining these things, I don't see any point in them. I agree with your deleted comment - this should be moved to chat, although I'm more than happy to leave it open-ended


















It's because it's at first glance a  seemingly ridiculous question. 

At first glance, you think that the user is drawing parallels just to fit their own views. This wasn't helped by the title "Naruto the Christian?" that it had before.

After the edit though, this question has improved a lot and doesn't really deserve the downvotes anymore - but I imagine there was a bit of "this has a big downvote amount so it must be bad" attitude with some users.

Whilst the question doesn't interest me at all, I do recognize that it's a legitimate question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Makes allot of sense. Well hope the down voters notice the post, and re-evaluate their original judgment.


















Krazer writes a bunch of things, again


What is your stance about identification request questions? What should be done to improve our guidelines and requirements from identification requests?


While I don't enjoy some of the id-reqs we get, I am tolerant of them. These types of questions are bound to come up with when asking question about anime and manga. Instead of disallowing them, I feel that it's more efficient in the long run to have a set of guideline in place to maintain quality standard to the site is not overridden with them.
Right now the problem we have with id-req is that the users don't tend to read the guidelines we have in place for these questions. In order to curb the somewhat rampant growth of these questions users have been encouraged to downvote and close questions that do not at least fulfill the minimum amount of detail specified by our guidelines. This is intended to be more of a stop-gap measure until we can find a better solution to better educated the new users asking them.
My current solution to dealing with this issue is to focus our attention on other parts of the site and community. If we continually dedicate the bulk of our resources to dealing with id-reqs, we will get tunnel visioned and forget about the other parts that need attention.
It pains me to see our front page littered with id-reqs as there are many other times of worth question out there on the Internet and on our site that could user attention. This is why I'd like to ask users to focus on asking other types of questions so that these tags will overshadow id-reqs, this will show new incoming users that we're more than just a site for id-reqs and encourage them to ask different varieties of questions. I don't necessarily want to get rid of them, but I don't want users to focus too much of their attention on them and forget about the rest of the site.


While you don't have to know the subject matter to be a mod, it often helps. Are there any major tags with which you have little to no experience? What will you do in the event that a questionable flag was made in an area where you have little expertise? (This is particularly important to our site since a large fraction of our questions comes from long-running shounen series like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/one-pieceone-piece, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fairy-tailfairy-tail, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball, etc. Since all these series inhabit the same genre/demographic, it is very possible that prospective mods who don't like that particular genre/demographic may have no knowledge of these series whatsoever.)


While having the highest rep count in the community, it doesn't necessarily mean I know it all. I have a passing knowledge of a majority of the major tags on the site. For those that I do not, I would most likely find some time to get to know them. Think of it as doing a bit of fact checking. Sometimes the OP might be mistaken, sometimes you might. Sometimes you might even stumble upon something they missed that might subsequently answer their question.
Sometimes these series are long and catching up to them for one scene in one episode might not be efficient, but I will at least make an attempt to do so.
We can't all like the same things, but it's important to be respectful about them. While there are anime that are regarded as better (or worse) than the rest, it's important to get to know what other people like so that you can get understand what they're looking for when they ask a question of give an answer.
While I don't frequent media from shoujo genre, there are times that I find myself-interested it them. You might not find that you like something until you've actually tried it.


You have been elected moderator of A&M SE, with two other nominees. The other moderators are heavily pushing a new change to the site policy, such as to id requests, but the community itself is split on the issue. You personally don't think the policy should be changed, but the other moderators are insistent it must be altered and repeatedly bring up discussion of change. How do you deal with this situation?


The key here is to offer a compromise. Both sides should be heard on the matter about their key points. To me the community's opinions are the most important, but the experience and advice of veteran users and moderator have the same weight as well. Sometime boths sides are right, sometimes both sides are wrong. The importance here is to minimize the potential for strife as it will divide the community and make negotiations less productive. If no decision can be made after extended discussions and debates, it's best to find a temporary compromise to satiate the major parties involved (like the stopgap measure I've proposed for id-reqs) for the time being until we can work on a better solution. It's better to work with each other than against each other.


With A&M, there has occasionally been a tendency for some posts on Meta to fade into obscurity and be forgotten / never dealt with. Also, our meta policies are scattered among many Meta posts from various dates, making it hard for users to know what is current. Do you feel this is an issue? How would you deal with this?


Admittedly, the Mods and I, myself in particular have been a bit neglectful with keeping up to date and clarify certain site policies.
If elected, I will work with the other mods to find a place on meta to provide a clearer explanation and work out the any inconsistencies we have with the any of current and past policies. Additionally, I'll try to provide better guide to help newer users to how our site guidelines work (or work differently) with Stack Exchange's existing policies. Especially the ones on explicit borderline content and the topic of "hentai" in general.


In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?


I feel that a moderator should do more than clearing queues, handling exceptions, and handling other administrative tasks. A good moderator is like a good narrator or GM, they should, in addition to their administrative duties, seek to help build a better users experience for their community (narrative, campaign) and users (readers, players), so they come back for more.
I have tried hosted a gift exchange (with the help of the other moderators), hosted anime watching sessions, done flavor of the week events for questions, all in an attempt to boost user engagement. While some of them had modest gain while others failed spectacularly, it was all to make the community seem like a friendlier place to be.


What current policies do you believe are too strictly enforced (either by mods or the community)? Which do you believe are not enforced strictly enough?


Id-reqs and the enforcing of borderline explicit content have been something that's been in a state of limbo for a while. Dealing with these topics can be quite time consuming, especially if you're looking to satisfy the majority of users involved. Just as they say Rome wasn't built in a day, the policies that make of the foundation of the community need time to be develop and settle in before we can build more on top of it.
If something is not being handled appropriately in a matter as one would I would ask the users what they find most unsatisfactory and listen to their feed in order to find a satisfactory solution.


Site promotion and (new and old) user retention has been an issue we've struggled with since the site's inception. Occasionally, we toss things at the walls to see what sticks, but that's not an effective long-term strategy. As a candidate, do you have any prospective (long-term and/or short term) strategies or ideas the deal with this issue (both within and outside of the Stack Exchange community)?


Currently our bounce rate from our analytics stats is very high, which means that most users don't stick around and look at other questions.
In addition to efforts to engage current users, such as anime viewing sessions, community exchanges, and potentially some sort of technical users group to work on anime and manga related project, I would like to get new users interested in our site by advertising our more well-developed questions across other recreational SEs as cross-community ads (E.g., "Have you ever wondered why nosebleed are so common in anime?").
Upping the effort to drawing attention using social is something else I would like to make a regular effort to do. Although search makes up ~90% of our traffic, we can't forever be reliant on our Google Search on it to carry us. The purpose of developing more community activities is to promote more interaction to intrinsically motivate users to participate in the community.
I want to users to here to have a good time and stay awhile and get to know each other. The better we know each other the more likely we'd recommend the site to our friends. Sure we might have a bit of a issue being seen as elitist by new users, but we can get past this with feedback from current users and their friends and users outside the community as well.
Just pushing buttons and being satisfied with the status quo won't be enough. In addition to efforts already made, I'd also like to look for feedback from the community about where they would like to us go and what to focus on. As more users participate and help build the community we'll grow and become stronger has a whole.


A user has an issue with an action you, as moderator, took; calling you out on meta, a chat room, comments, or otherwise. How do you handle this?


This has happened before. When this happens I will try to approach the issue objectively and offer my explanation of what happened, what I did and why I did it. The intent is to offer to them my side of story and then deal with any follow-ups that user may have.
Sometimes a user is obstinate on a certain viewpoint. If there is merit in elaborating on it, I will make an attempt to dissect the issues and pinpoint the area of conflict and work in it a matter that the user can relate, such as using simple analogies to commonplace things.
I will typically listen to what they have to say first before giving my own feedback. If I am wrong then I will admit that I am and acknowledge it. I make an effort to treat all issues objectively with as little prejudice as possible.


How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?


Many users have many different ways of expressing themselves, I'm very lenient about that how they go about doing it as long as they don't intentionally antagonize other users or violate any core site rules (e.g., the content policy on explicit media).
Rather than admonishing them, I'd try to first find out the source of these flags and issues and talk with the user to better understand why this is happening and perhaps encourage them to channel their efforts to something more productive. It doesn't matter is the user is new or old, each user is equally important and should be be encourage to channel their efforts where they best fit.
Bans and suspensions to me are a last resort. I don't like waving them around like a bat, unless absolutely nothing else can be done.


How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?


Generally I would trust in their judgment, but sometimes their feeling might get the better of them. I would ask for their reasoning behind it their action/decision, if I feel that there is merit and that the situation was sufficiently explained to the user, I will leave it at that.
If however I see some fault, I will attempt to negotiate with the other mod, unless there is an overwhelming outcry from the community against the decision, I'll leave the final decision of whether the action was just up to the mod that made the decision.


How would you attempt to change policy if you and the fellow moderators agree on an issue but other members are split on the matter? 　As an elected representative, should your actions strive to reflect the wishes of the community, or were you entrusted by the community to act against the majority consensus at times for the sake of the greater good?


As a mod of a community it's up to us to represent and enforce the interests of the community and not push our own ideals upon then. A well-developed community should be able to act upon and itself to an extend, without the direct intervention of the moderators. I feel that it's important for the moderators to not just help the community make decisions but also promote cooperation between users. I believe that no one individual's opinions should outweigh that of the community. If a mod believe that the community is headed in a wrong direction, it's up to them to inform and guide them to a right one by promoting consensus. Sometimes a mod may be right, while other time they may be wrong, it's up to the community to come to the final conclusion.
XX. As a bonus, I'd like the brief address @seijitsu questions and comments from the comment to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2514/63this answer
If you should give an example of how a question and answer using such tags will for, so we can deduce how feasible it would be to add these metatags to the site. I'm reluctant to use genre specific tags they are only intended to be used as accessories to other tags. I'm fine with allowing publication specific tags, but but I'm a bit afraid that adding genre tags may lead to senseless bickering (e.g., can this really be considered https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scifiscifi). However if you can present a practical example from of a question from an expert of the subject, I'll consider making an effort to help you promote them.
It's a given that sometimes even the most knowledgeable ppl can miss out on the simplest inaccuracies in common everyday things. While we can't forcibly change any accepted answers, we can at least make an attempt to rally the community in upvoting the better answer and downvoting the opinionating one. You can bring this to this to our attention by leave a comment, casting your vote, and letting other people know in chat. We'll do what we can to rectify the situation.
One of the efforts in particular I want to focus on particular in regards to user engagement is to sit down and have a personal dialogue with prospective users, though current users to find out what they like and don't like about the site. SO I would like to invite you (@seijitsu and any other users interested) and anyone who they might think would be interested for an extended open dialogue (on a platform/service of your choosing) on what we lack, what's not working and what you think we should do about it.

Nominee: Memor-X - The Lily Rose Knight


  
  What is your stance about identification request questions? What should be done to improve our guidelines and requirements from identification requests?
  


At this point in time my current stance is for Identification Requests as they can be a good entry level question for a new user in which it wont be closed as duplicate when done correctly

I believe the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892current guidelines are good enough but the problem lies in just who is taking the time to read them? some new users come here and post an id request but use the wrong tag (such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production or [tag: mangaka]) thus they wont get the pop up about the guidelines, others i believe are probably not seeing it as because they add https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request last.

So what needs to be done is to make the guidelines more visible such as possibly finding a way to add them to the https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourTour, maybe in the off topic section as we have a Off-Topic Close reason for when they don't contain enough information. something under the lines of 


  Identification Requests if they do not meet out https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892guidelines


But this only helps with new users who take the time to go though the Tour and many don't even do that. ideally what would like to do is see a new feature implanted that brand new users (those with 1 rep) have to press [Post your Quest] twice, the first time bring up a pop up similar to what the id quest tag, with that we can redirect them to the tour or to the guidelines. this functionally gets removed once the user has met the rep requirement for https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/participate-in-metaParticipate in Meta

the reason why i have yet to suggest it on Meta.SE for the SEx Gods to implement is that i have yet to figure out how it can aid other SE sites


  
  While you don't have to know the subject matter to be a mod, it often helps. Are there any major tags with which you have little to no experience? What will you do in the event that a questionable flag was made in an area where you have little expertise? (This is particularly important to our site since a large fraction of our questions comes from long-running shounen series like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/one-pieceone-piece, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fairy-tailfairy-tail, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball, etc. Since all these series inhabit the same genre/demographic, it is very possible that prospective mods who don't like that particular genre/demographic may have no knowledge of these series whatsoever.)
  


It's going to be problematic if all 3 elected mods don't know anything about them however looking at the kind of flags that can be raised knowledge in a particular series is not required, after all a mod should be just as easily be able to tell when a question/answer is spam, clearly violates the http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policycontent policy or is rude and/or abusive.

For custom flags there should have enough details to help the mod know what the user believes is wrong is a post but ofcause flags saying "this answer is wrong" or citing why it is wrong will be marked as not helpful (or whatever the equivalent is when a flag is rejected) as that is not what flags are meant to be for.


  
  You have been elected moderator of A&M SE, with two other nominees. The other moderators are heavily pushing a new change to the site policy, such as to id requests, but the community itself is split on the issue. You personally don't think the policy should be changed, but the other moderators are insistent it must be altered and repeatedly bring up discussion of change. How do you deal with this situation?
  


i would ask for reasons why the policy should be changed beyond "I just don't like them" and that every other alternative has been implemented and shown not to help. beyond that i would want to see a Meta post with the community citing as to why they do/do not want the to change beyond "i like/don't like them" or "i get a lot of rep if this changed/remained"


  
  With A&M, there has occasionally been a tendency for some posts on Meta to fade into obscurity and be forgotten / never dealt with. Also, our meta policies are scattered among many Meta posts from various dates, making it hard for users to know what is current. Do you feel this is an issue? How would you deal with this?
  


i dont personally find this all that big of an issue however it would explain why we were discussing why Avatar and RWBY should be on topic again when i remember on the Meta it being said that they are still on-topic

I mentioned this on the Chat once that we could create something like a table of reference Meta post where each answer would be the results of a ruling (ie. is Avatar on-topic, is id requests on Fan Made AMVs on-topic, the id request guidelines) plus listing the discussions that took place. if the decision on this changes we can update the answer

Ofcause it was noted to me by Logan M that there is a shit ton of Meta Questions and a metric shit ton of answers, not all of which would be about site policy. if there is far too many then i would like to see Revision questions made where we get the general feedback of the current policies in place and use them as a basis, obviously people who posted before can re-post/cite their answers of their stance has changed. after that it's just a matter of making sure the post is exposed enough


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  


*keeps staring at the fancy diamond by Krazer's name*

oh right, question. going on by what is describe on http://blog.stackexchange.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/this SE Blog Post there are 2 things that i can't do now and that's cast binding votes so i don't have to wait for others to vote to close or delete and seeing more stats of the site and really aside from the latter i do everything else so to be honest if made a mod i will just be doing more of what i have already been doing and seeing results quicker as i wont be needing to wait on other high enough rep users to wake up for posts that are clearly in need of moderation


  
  What current policies do you believe are too strictly enforced (either by mods or the community)? Which do you believe are not enforced strictly enough?
  


to me every seems to be fine however my one beef is that some users with id requests just post up a name and that's it, sometimes with a link to My Anime List or the like and sometimes the summary of the series but never why it matches even if it happens to be the correct answer. ofcause the only thing that can be done with this answer is downvote them and undo this when the user updates their answer.


  
  Site promotion and (new and old) user retention has been an issue we've struggled with since the site's inception. Occasionally, we toss things at the walls to see what sticks, but that's not an effective long-term strategy. As a candidate, do you have any prospective (long-term and/or short term) strategies or ideas the deal with this issue (both within and outside of the Stack Exchange community)?
  


When a new series airs the awarding of bounties for the first month or so after the series for has finished airing for new questions that receive a minimum score (ie +3) but to do this every time will be problematic without a good supply of rep, also offering bounties to old unanswered questions to promote them.

of cause in both of these id requests should be made exempt because we don't want out featured list to get full and we want new users to see that there is alot more to the site that id requests


  
  A user has an issue with an action you, as moderator, took; calling you out on meta, a chat room, comments, or otherwise. How do you handle this?
  


Pistol, 6 chambers, 1 bullet, whoever dies looses, in case if the shot isn't fatal the gun is reloaded. oh and this immortal fox girl is my stand in.

to be serious i would point them to the rules which i am enforcing with my action and ask them what it is they have an issue to see if i can clear up the misunderstanding. if i have myself misunderstood something i will defer to the other mods for their opinion on how they would have acted in the same situation and if i am incorrect i should be able to reverse my action.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


i would see what kind of flag they seem to be attracted and suggest an alternative course, as a mod i should be able to see who is flagging them so i see if that person has flagged anyone else, if all of their flags have been a single person while other people have been flagging other i would like to inquire why they are targeting one user


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


I would ask the mod to explain their reasoning while making sure they understand what my reasons for disagreeing with their decision hoping that we can some to the same understanding somewhere


  
  How would you attempt to change policy if you and the fellow moderators agree on an issue but other members are split on the matter?　As an elected representative, should your actions strive to reflect the wishes of the community, or were you entrusted by the community to act against the majority consensus at times for the sake of the greater good?
  


explain to the community why we want a change so they can understand what is going on and why there needs to be change along with what we believe to be the future benefits of such a change, given of cause the benefits vastly outweigh the consequences. but if the change isn't a "must happen or the site will die" then i would rather see the community vote on it
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was aware of the old posts on Avatar and RWBY. I made a new post because there was a group of users voting to close all the Avatar questions in spite of the original meta posts, and I thought it was worthwhile to reaffirm the community's opinion or find out if it had changed. See the discussion [here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/24013/7579). In my opinion, our new discussion helped alleviate the confusion in our meta by offering concrete policies and practical guidelines instead of starting another argument about whether Avatar is anime.


















Stack Overflow and Programmers have discussions pretty frequently on whether they should change the way they treat new users. (Here's https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/251758/3376926a famous one from SO.) The usual argument runs that new users should read the FAQ, they should familiarize themselves with the help center, and if they can't do those things, then, for the quality of the site, their questions should be deleted. Those guys can be mean as hell, especially to people with subpar English or writing skills.

I've not seen that kind of intolerance on Anime and Manga. By contrast, I've seen our users go out of their way to try and make sense of complete and utter nonsense so it could be edited into a decent question. (I've been that user a few times; as a former tutor of English as a Second Language, I understand that not everyone can have native-level proficiency.) Most downvoted and close voted questions receive a comment explaining why the question is not up to grade. Sometimes the comment may be a little brisk, but I've never seen anyone here heap mean or sarcastic remarks on a new user who wrote a bad question.

By Stack Exchange standards, we're actually quite friendly and lenient. However, we are more elitist and exclusionary than most other anime sites out there. Although many of our users get here from Stack Overflow, Physics, Science Fiction and Fantasy, or other Stack Exchange sites, many more come from the wider Internet, and they're not used to the high standards of Stack Exchange.

I suspect my answer runs counter to the direction many people want for the site, but, to be honest, I like being elitist, exclusionary jerks.

Before you downvote, hear me out. I've been in the anime fandom almost fifteen years. During that time, I was never attracted to any of the available anime fan communities on the Internet. Recently, I spent some time on Reddit and 4chan doing research for an answer here, and I remembered why that was. It's because every discussion they have goes something like this:


  Clannad greatest animu evar!! So many feelz
  
  Clannad forced drama bulsh****TTT Y U NOT SEE IT?
  
  U SUXX
  
  NO U XUZZSU
  
  UR MOM SUXXX...ON ME LOL


The discussion on http://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/129499448Why is Clannad the best anime? is actually on the better side of what I've seen on 4chan and Reddit, but the second thing someone writes on it is


  Too vanilla. Now if Tomoya fucked Ushio, that would be something.


I assume this person is just trying to be shocking by suggesting that the main character having sex with his five-year-old daughter is just what was needed to spice up the show.

Putting aside the puerile nature of the discourse, if you ask a question on one of these sites, it's impossible to ask people to support their answers with evidence because they'll just call you an idiot for not knowing what "everyone" knows, even in cases where the thing that "everyone" knows was concocted out of thin air by some bored forum troll. 

Frankly, I don't want to invite these people to Anime and Manga Stack Exchange. I enjoy the fact that we have standards, and that we won't tolerate just any garbage that someone felt like throwing up on their monitor. Nothing we ask about on this site is really that important, in the grand scheme of things. No one is going to get killed or fired if I include some unsourced information in my answer on a show about 24th Century Martian gondoliers. But it is nice to think that people can't just make up whatever they want and start throwing it around as a well-known fact. And it is nice that no one here tries to be Howard Stern and make shocking statements just for the fun of it it, or starts randomly cussing because you don't believe their pet theory about the masturbation scene in End of Eva.

I think we have a good balance right now. We're a fan community; we don't require our users to be working on a Ph.D in pop culture studies. We're not the Math Overflow of anime. We're lenient towards people with subpar English; as long as we can make some kind of sense of a question, we'll edit or let it stand. We point new users towards the relevant parts of the manual, rather than just saying "RTFM or GTFO". We're tolerant towards the fact that people expect to be able to discuss Legend of Korra and Tales of Symphonia on the same site where they discuss Naruto and One Piece. At the same time, we don't tolerate the kind of worthless garbage that floods Reddit and 4chan, and we expect a basic level of politeness from everyone. 

I think the kind of users we want to attract are people who are reasonably polite, have reasonable writing skills to express themselves, and are willing to learn and obey the rules. It's fine if they're not great at writing, as long as they can get the basic idea across. It's fine if they don't know a lot about anime; I have no problem answering basic questions like https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/15069/7579Who's the artist of the Oreimo's Suki Nandamon original edition theme song? or even https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21027/7579Who is the creator of the manga Yu Yu Hakusho?. It's fine if they don't spend three weeks studying the help center before asking a question; we have plenty of people willing to take the time to help out a newbie. Not everyone will be this kind of user; some people evidently like how it is on other sites. If someone prefers the atmosphere at some other site, let them stay at that site. Let us remain an island of civility and intelligent discourse in a sea of sophomoric bile.

If this means we stay small, I think that's all right. We don't need to be as large as MAL and ANN. We'll make up for our size with high-quality content. People will come here when they have a tough question that requires a maniac level of fandom to crack. If, after that, they want to go back to that thread with 36,000 posts of people cussing at each other over whether Lelouch was alive at the end of Code Geass, let them go.

You tyrant :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ohohohoho >:)  .b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pretty nice answer. Also, boku no pico is a piece of art too. You might not like pornographic materials, hentai, yaoi or just BnP, but respect it! (I just don't like yaoi, don't get me wrong.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ardaozkal I don't have anything against yaoi or pornographic materials. I've even read a few yaoi in the interest of "scientific curiosity" and open-mindedness. Totally wasn't my thing, but I did it. A few months ago we had this troll on the site who went around and put "Boku no Pico gay fag bitches!" and similar as the answer to a bunch of id requests that clearly *weren't* looking for Boku no Pico. I brought it up in a joking way to reinforce my point about the kind of people I don't want on the site. But since there's no fun allowed here, Toshinou-san edited it out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda 1) I know that you aren't against it. 2) I congratulate your open mindedness. I read for scientific curiosity too 3) Yes, fun is not allowed. I even got a warning for it (on Arqade). Have a nice day~~~~


















Yesterday, I closed a question (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/24236/https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/24236/). It was an identification request for pornography, though that may not have been directly apparent from the question alone. 

This proved controversial; two users plus Krazer ended up reopening it. I suppose I must have misled myself into believing that porn-identification questions were unwanted here. 

In order that we may have a documented position on this matter: do we want identification requests for pornography? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we want identification requests for pornography?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I felt that your actions may have been a bit too overly admonishing, but I do understand where you are coming from with this. We should find time to discuss this in more detail so we might don't do anything too rashly in the future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There was also some discussion on this issue (specific to id requests) on [this answer to "Is explicit content off topic or not?"](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/2408/7579)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As the discussion on the link in my previous comment indicates, coming up with a policy on this issue is extremely complicated because the OP often doesn't know they're looking for porn and not something like To-Love-Ru which is graphic, but not *porno*graphic. In many cases you have to answer the question to find out that it's porn. I suppose we could, if we wanted, instantly delete any id request which turns out to be looking for porn.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda "the OP often doesn't know they're looking for porn" - this is, of course, another one of the many degenerate things about ID requests. Is OP looking for porn? Is he looking for a James Bond movie? Is he looking for a comedy sketch he once saw? OP obviously doesn't know, so we either have to accept all identification requests that are sufficiently vague as to perhaps be an anime, or close questions based on their answers, neither of which is a good option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin I've already been convinced that the flaws of id requests outweigh their benefits.This issue, to me, is the [Barber Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_paradox) that shows why id reqs and the SE model don't coexist well--if we want to limit certain kinds of content (e.g. hentai), but we allow id requests, then we can have perfectly valid questions which become invalid once they're answered and the answer turns out to be hentai. As you say, closing questions based on their answers is ridiculous...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...but then how do we limit the content? We can't, because we don't know what the content is going to be. But limiting certain content is a fundamental part of SE. It's as if we couldn't tell whether a question was going to be primarily opinion based until we had ten answers that were all clearly unsubstantiated opinions. In my opinion, if we keep id reqs and refuse to embrace hentai, then this issue has only bad solutions.


















I don't know what those users were thinking reopening that question. I think we've said it countless times that we don't want to become associated with "the site that identifies porn". Even if the work which this image comes from is not a hentai doujin (which I doubt isn't the case), OP needs to find a less suggestive image for the ID request to survive.

To those who are on the borderline about this: There is only one step from erotic to pornographic content, and at the rate we're receiving ID requests, it may be a very quick step.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why even target ID-reqs specifically? If users can't use "suggestive images" then no one can post "suggestive images" anywhere. This is only one step away from banning questions on any lewd anime.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're getting most of these from IDs and I think it's the most risky tag. Of course, all other tags may also be at risk, but not as much as IDs. In any case, I agree with Krazer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Frosteeze NaPaTa's work is R18+. No "lewd" anime is R18+ without being classified as outright hentai. Not even ridiculous shit like Shinmai Maou no Testament or To-Love Ru. There is a clear dividing line.


















Recently(ish) the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/24028/sources-for-christian-themes-and-motifs-in-narutoSources for Christian themes and motifs in Naruto? made an appearance in meta because someone noticed the sheer amount of downvotes it had and found it to be strange, considering the legitimacy of the question. It was quickly established that the question was originally much more lacking than its current state, but probably no longer deserved the score it had. 

But, as Killua noted in a comment, the question received four downvotes before it was edited, and since https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48578/what-can-cause-a-question-to-be-bumpedSE prevents questions with a score of -4 or less from being bumped upon edit, the question remained at low score until someone went to the trouble of making an entire meta post about it.

Of course, the topic of the question probably played a role in the initial downvote barrage, but that's a different post.

Simply put, is there any way for questions downvoted past the point of bumpability to be given a second look once whatever issue they have is solved? Do we consider this too much of a corner case to bother with?

As moderator election are coming to an end, I would like to invite members of the community to take some time to review all the policies we've made in the past and see if they are still relevant, but need revision, and see which need be deprecated or better clarification.

This is intent to take action on some of the more discussed topics from this election, as well as open for discussion previous. This way, the elected moderators will have a chance to review and make any necessary changes to improve over user satisfaction and experience.

Please considering use the following template for your replies:

After sufficient review, analysis, and discussion, a meta with compendium of our site policies with their last review date will be create for easy browsing and reference to these policies.

Clarification: The intent of this meta is to collect problems areas our site, particularly with it's policies, so that we can build proper queuing system to address these problems one by one, instead of dividing our attention across multiple issues. This way, we give the users a transparency and clarify behind the state of policy making for the community. 

The end-product is intended to be a general how to use guide (probably will be hosted on Trello) for Anime.SE detailing our current policies, those that we're working on, and known problems we looking to address.

Most of the time I see image-only id-requests be closed as duplicate of the reverse search question.

However, reviewers need to (should) be verifying themselves that it is in fact a duplicate. I feel like people just assume the initial close vote is correct (and it's been mentioned on chat that this attitude seems to exist)

Should we change our approach to these as 'too little detail to be answered' first and duplicate later? 

Pros:


Faster review time (less wasted time for x number of close votes)
Less chance of incorrect go with the flow closures, misleading users
Less rule complexity (as reverse searching is in the guidelines)


Cons:


Potential for an asker to edit many times, and still be reverse-searchable, wasting their time.
may be reopened, but searchable because reopen voters haven't checked


What do you think? Is this a worthwhile closure attitude change?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we be closing image-only id requests differently?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My general rule of thumb is: Right click the image, *Search Google for this image*, if I can find the answer without scrolling, I close as a duplicate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Should we change our approach to these as 'too little detail to be answered' first and duplicate later?" − why not both?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase because only one is the final closure reasonb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just close as "too little detail" if it's just an image dump with no additional information. If it passes that, I try Google reverse image search via Madara's method.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Killua's method is also good because some of these image dumps really aren't trivially searchable, but for some reason that doesn't make the question any less trivial (e.g. it's a manga page, and Google counts all pages from all manga as similar images; it's a gif, and no one has found the one frame that's trivially reverse-searchable).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was one of the people who had gotten this wrong.  I reverse image searched an image, found something that looked like a match, and started the close vote.  However, the correct answer wasn't what I had found, and was in fact something not easily found by reverse image search.  I'm not sure what to do in that kind of a case.


















I recently come across this question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/24049/how-come-japanese-animation-studios-never-produce-anime-for-international-audienHow come Japanese animation studios never produce anime for international audiences? in the list of deleted questions. It is closed as "unclear what you are asking" and has been deleted by roomba script.

The question body reads:


  Other than their usual Japanese audience, Why have animation studios never made an anime targetted internationally? - i.e. at non Japanese audiences?


I think this question might have interesting answer, from reading the comments:


  Considering Naruto's low rating in Japan, it is clear that the reason it still continues is because the non-japanese market is their intended market. Never produced anime for international audiences? Not really then. –  Sakurai Tomoko Aug 13 at 11:43 
  
  There are several targetted at western audiences, but they've mostly failed miserably. [...] –  Toshinou Kyouko Aug 13 at 12:54
  
  @ToshinouKyouko for example, Alexander Senki. Miserable failure, deservedly so. –  Torisuda Aug 13 at 17:38 




The OP does comment, clarifying (?) their intention:


  @SakuraiTomoko Sorry but thats not the right answer I'II clarify the question,I mean why don't anime studios create an anime with original English language because they creating for English speaking audiences aside from its Japanese audiences? –  Daniel Aug 13 at 11:54


This seems to be another question altogether, probably asking Why anime is not produced with both English dub and Japanese dub?



Does the community think if it's feasible to extract interesting questions out of this deleted question?

I'm not asking to salvage it, since it may conflict with the intention of the original author of the deleted question.

I think this question is good and shouldn't have been closed in the first place.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao The problem is - without a clear wording, the question can take an entirely different direction. Even your interpretation is different from mine, which shows that the original question is unclear. Do feel free to post your question, though.

Translate from/to Japanese

Want to translate something from Japanese to English or the other way around? Check out this list:


http://jisho.org/Jisho.org − Japanese from/to English. Supports romaji, kanji;
https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/Google Translate − Japanese from/to most languages. Supports kanji (with hand-drawn option);

Less obviously, Google Translate also can fail horribly when translation from Japanese _to other languages that aren't English_, because of the translation mechanism. (Google translates the original language to English, and then the result to the target language: something which I readily confirmed by testing whether differentiation between different forms of "you" would be preserved when translating from French to German.)


















Policy: Future Unannounced Events https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contradictorycontradictory https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/needs-clarificationneeds-clarification
Our current policy is closure for Unannounced Future Events.
Reason:
There are conflicting metas on what exactly Unannounced Future Events means.
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27/what-do-we-do-with-questions-about-future-events-releases?lq=1The original Meta post :

"What is to happen in the future" is something that should be kept off-topic.

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/664/15302013 FAQ Proposal

Questions on future events with regard to the production of an anime or manga are off-topic

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/800/2014-edition-how-should-we-treat-questions-regarding-future-unannounced-eventsThe 2014 Meta Post

I suggest, much like @GraceNote's post on What do we do with questions about future events/releases? back in '12, that we leave future events to new sources such as ANN or Crunchyroll.

I can't find anywhere where we actually define that future announced events are on topic. It seems to be in some fuzzy space between 2013 and 2014, and the title of the 2014 post stuck.
This leads to some confusion when closing posts - "When will X happen?" is only on topic if someone can find a news post about it? I think our policy should be that any future events should be off-topic.
Remarks:
I brought this up before in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2231/can-we-change-the-name-of-this-closure-reasona previous meta, but it's still unchanged and has caused confusion with close votes a few times.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why do you think our policy should be that questions about all future events should be off-topic, aside from it causing confusion about close votes?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin rather - why should announced ones be on topic? These are a news sources field, not ours - and these questions go out-of-date and also - who can say for sure it hasn't been announced, but in an offline capacity?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin also by their very nature - future events are uncertainb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Many classes of questions can become out of date. For example, "Why did X do Y?" in any manga. At the point the question is asked, the answer might be "A", but then ten chapters later, we find out that the answer was actually "B", and twenty chapters later, it turns out the _real_ reason was "C".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"These are a news sources field" is both true and irrelevant. I do not think that "news", as we typically encounter it, is so fundamentally unlike the rest of the questions we get as to warrant removing it altogether.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that nobody can say for sure that a given thing hasn't been announced in an offline capacity, and that this is a significant issue with trying to discriminate between announced and unannounced events. My preferred approach would instead to be to let _all_ non-egregious questions about out-of-universe events remain open for a suitable period of time (a month, say), and then closing them if by that point nobody has produced evidence that the thing in question has been announced.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this kind of questions can still be on-topic, if there's at least strong evidence to backup them. Let's say, if I ask "When will Natsume Yuujinchou season 5 come?", it's obviously off-topic since there's no official announcement if they will continue the series. Next, if I ask "What is the release date of Shingeki no Kyojin season 2", if at that time there's only rumor about the date, then it's off-topic. However, when there's an official announcement that clearly mentions the date, then it becomes on-topic. .. (cont'd)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However, I think that a disclaimer is important when answering such question, since as you have already mention, future events are unpredictable (such as Kizumonogatari movie)

Explicit and Borderline Content: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/needs-clarificationneeds-clarification

We've had a lot of run-in media on the site that would be considered either explicit or borderline (even though they are hidden behind a spoiler and/or have a NSFW warning). It's sometimes hard to tell if the piece of media is explicit or not. A set of guidelines and set procedures would probably help streamline things.

Reason: 

Due to individual circumstances we're can't all agree on what's lewd and not. In the fine art, there's a (fine) line between art and pornography. Our personal upbringings shape how we think about these things. We need to find some point where we can agree on at least.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we take ID requests out of the picture for the purposes of this post? There is obviously no way to determine (a priori) whether an ID request will generate explicit content. This discussion will go significantly better if we focus on drawing a line for non-ID content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Senshin Okay. I removed that bit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One point I think needs some clarification--are we talking about guidelines for the discussion of works which contain sexual material, regardless of whether such material appears in the actual post, or are we talking about guidelines for material which actually appears in the post? I've not seen this distinction made much in previous metas on this topic. I think the two cases call for different approaches, and that we can afford to be more lenient in the former case.


















Where do we draw the line with derivative and loosely anime/manga/novel related content https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/needs-clarificationneeds-clarification

We've need a clearer stance on how to handle derivative content beyond AMV and doujinshi (i.e. what would be considered off topic) and very loosely related content such as Vocaloids and games (w/o a direct anime/manga/novel tie-in). While we've talked about https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2270/are-identification-request-questions-looking-for-amv-on-topicAMVs and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/352/what-is-the-criteria-for-questions-about-doujin-work/especially https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/267/should-questions-about-doujinshi-be-alloweddoujinshi, we haven't talked about other derivative works such as remixes or identification request for dervative content such as a gameplay video with some sort of Jpop-like lyric. 

For now we support (please add if you feel that any are missing):


Vocaloid (to what extent is unclear)
Plot-related to 2d/3d games (those that are "anime-styled" at least; however, there is no specific criteria)
Original anime/manga style self-made/publish works (i.e. Doujinshi) 
Live-action series based off anime/manga/novels (we don't get many aside from plot comparisons atm)


Some examples of derivative content can be:


A non-anime/manga gameplay video with some Jpop-esque music in the background
A random anime-like image on a video music playlist
A game or character skin with anime/manga-esque character or design


Reason: 

It's a given that much of these issues involve fringe cases. but having a blanket policy to address them can save time and effort. We can still address any unique cases when they come up, but a there should at least be a more streamline way to handle questions for these types of media.

Remarks: 

I believe that by putting a little effort here, we avoid doing more work later on. As much as we'd like to address everything and anything related to anime/manga/novels, not everything that is a good fit. We should start looking at where to draw the line sooner rather than later. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it's possible to streamline our handling of these issues, since the problem domain itself is not "streamlined", so to speak. If we don't opt to set a firm cutoff at "only questions about anime or manga" (which I don't think anybody wants to do), I don't see how we can go about this other than on a case-by-case basis.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin We can at least give it a try. If we fail we fail, we'll at least learn something from it. For an example, one way of handling the a music req is to make sure the OP ties it back for something related to the subculture. If as sure can offer sufficient proof that the song they are trying to find is indeed someone's remix or revocal of a vocaloid song, then it's fine. Otherwise it would be off topic because it can be any ol' jpop mix. In other words, we try to makes sure that the OP understands that if they can't demonstrate that this work is related to the subculture, it's not on-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think this is a priority, but it'll be good for the future

As the end of the sign up is drawing near, I figured posting phase 1 state to be quite appropriate. The baking will start at 19-9-2015, and no worries! I managed to convince my lovely girlfriend to help me bake them (so they will actually be edible, yay!) For all those that did not sign up yet or are still deciding, be fast, or miss the lovely super cute cookies!
Phase 2: Sending them out
As I am currently in the process of packing and sending them out, I figured I should give everybody a little sneak peak of what the are going to receive.

Supposedly ID requests too, but this is not exactly how tags work, right? What about instead of combining these tags in questions where someone asks to identify music, we use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification?

The tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request is primarily used to identify anime or manga. Should music be included?

What are the pros and cons of both options? Which should we use when?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Creating a tag specifically about identifying musicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5idk how many questions have the ID tag that aren't the ID requests we know and love now, but the questions with music tag this way will have two distinct types of questions − ID and non-ID. I don't think this is a good thing because using one tag for two different enough things is confusing.


















I think there needs to be some clarification here on what current https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions are and their scope.

Let's look at the wiki:


  For questions which ask about the identification of an anime/manga/character using a description; specific elements (like a character or song); or screenshots


This is currently how they are supposed to be used.

It also doesn't make much sense to keep the existing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag if we would want to split them up - as it will be confusing to users. If there is a consensus to get https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification and et cetera, we should also get https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/series-identificationseries-identification, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/x-identificationx-identification, ...

I don't think this is the actual solution to our problem. From the original meta question:


  I see why people are tagging these questions with identification-request - the asker wants something "identified", right? But this is a dangerous line of thinking. Should we tag Is Nadia voluntarily inspired by Castle in the Sky? with identification-request because the asker wants to "identify" the connection between Nadia and Castle in the Sky? What about The Kamisama Hajimemashita anime covers the manga up to what chapter? - doesn't the asker want to "identify" the chapter at which the anime ends? No, of course we shouldn't.


This problem still remains if we change this but it shifts from one tag to multiple - should we create a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/series-connection-identificationseries-connection-identification tag? a  https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chapter-identificationchapter-identification tag, does chapter ids fit in manga ids? ....

Instead I propose that there should be some clarification for when the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/id-requestid-request tag should be used. Whether that turns out to be for questions where the series is unknown,specific media elements, or some other decision.

For my actual opinion on splitting the tag up - I'm indifferent, but I don't want to do it for the wrong reasons
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5> *Instead I propose that there should be some clarification for when the id-request tag should be used.* − Well, this is what this meta post is about :pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase :P it started off as a comment, but it got massive - I just wanted to point out that this should be a pre-requisite taskb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we stop claiming that the current tag wiki for [identification-request] carries any weight? The wiki was edited a few times within the first few months of the site's existence and barely touched since. Back then, since identification requests weren't taking over the site, these changes were made without extensive prior discussion - which is fine, but we should not take the tag wiki to reflect anything but the preferences of the few editors involved.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin the tag wiki is what users see when they are looking if their question suits a tag - so it does carry weight. Just because it hasn't been edited much doesn't mean it's not relevant.

This is only a small thing in my question anyway and doesn't affect the fact the clarification is needed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5so are you both saying we should first clarify what exactly the ID tag is about and then if we can use it for music identification?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase exactly


















I agree with Toshinou-san that we need clarification about https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request edge cases—not just for music, but also for questions that ask, for example, to explain a reference, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4127/7579Who are these characters referenced in Chapter 4 of Spotted Flower? (which is tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request) and https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/17248/7579Who are all the girls fawning over Araragi? (which is just tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monogatari-seriesmonogatari-series). 

However, I don't think making another tag for music identification is a very good solution. As touched on a bit in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2307/7579the post senshin linked to, helping people find questions they can answer is a major purpose of tags. If you want to identify a song from Naruto, the person who knows is probably a Naruto expert. If you want to identify a song from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamotte_ShugogettenMamotte Shugogetten, the person who knows is probably an expert on Mamotte Shugogetten (if such a thing even exists). There probably isn't anyone on the site who's a "soundtrack expert" that can identify songs from both Naruto and Mamotte Shugogetten, but has no interest in other types of question on Naruto or Mamotte Shugogetten. (I can see such a person existing on Movies and TV—a music superfan who loves identifying songs that appear in movies and TV shows—but https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/24272/does-anybody-recognise-this-song-from-princess-kaguya/24290#comment34993_24272things are different in anime.)

Given that, I don't really see a clear purpose for a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification tag. I suppose it could help people who love Mamotte Shugogetten, but aren't familiar with the OST, to avoid music identification questions. But the titles are usually something like "What song plays at time 7:23 in Episode 19 of Mamotte Shugogetten?". And the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic tag should be a good enough signal for that sort of thing on its own; my Gedankenexperimental expert can just look for questions tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mamotte-shugogettenmamotte-shugogetten and not tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic.

Tagging music identifications as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request has some of the same problems as the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification tag. We don't really have "identification experts"; id requests require either a good memory and a broad knowledge of anime, or the dumb luck to have seen and remembered whatever the OP is looking for and the reading skills to pick it out of their description. This is different from the knowledge needed to identify a song from a known series. My preferred solution would be just tagging music identifications as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mamotte-shugogettenmamotte-shugogetten https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure whether the Spotted Flower question is a good example here, since no one bother (or has the time) to comb over all the questions and check whether the tags are appropriate. (My opinion is that the id-req tag should stay on Spotted Flower and even the Monogatari question since the series is not know, but others may think otherwise)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh I just brought those two questions up because the difference in how they use the id request tag confuses me, and I think we need clarification. I put the id request tag on a similar question that I asked ([What is the cover of Reset! Chapter 2 a reference to?](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/13076/7579)), but I don't know if I was right to use it like that. You make a good point that in these cases, the series being referenced was *not* known, so answering the question requires similar skills to the traditional type of id request.


















Let's analyze the pro and con of using https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requesthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic vs. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification, in term of categorizing questions.

We have 3 categories of questions related to music:


Identification request for a series, with a piece of music as clue (answer contains both the series name and the track title)
Soundtrack identification where the series is known (answer contains the track title)
Other non-identification questions related to music


We observe that category 2 and 3 specify complementing sets of questions for a particular series: music identification questions and other music-related questions.

We would like to analyze the categorizing effect of tagging based on the following scenarios:


Search for category 1
Search for category 2
Search for category 3
Search for category 1 and 2 (all music identification questions)
Search for category 2, for a particular series (all soundtrack identification questions of a series)
Search for category 3, for a particular series/topic (all non-identification music questions of a series/topic)
Search for category 2 and 3, for a particular series (all music-related questions of a series)




Scheme 1a: With the previous scheme of tagging (before https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2307/we-shouldnt-use-identification-request-on-questions-that-arent-really-identisenshin's meta thread):

Tagging scheme:


Category 1 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requesthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic
Category 2 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requesthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic, plus series tag
Category 3 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic, plus appropriate tags.


Search queries for each scenario:


Scenario 1 and 2 can't be searched, since category 1 and 2 are both tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requesthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic, and differentiated with the existence of series tag, which can't be excluded in the search.
Scenario 3 can be found with [music] -[identification-request].
Scenario 4 can be found with [music][identification-request].
Scenario 5 can be found with [<series tag>][music][identification-request].
Scenario 6 can be found with [<series tag>][music] -[identification-request]
Scenario 7 can be found with [<series tag>][music]


Scheme 2a: With the current scheme of tagging (after https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2307/we-shouldnt-use-identification-request-on-questions-that-arent-really-identisenshin's meta thread):

Tagging scheme:


Category 1 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requesthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic
Category 2 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic, plus series tag
Category 3 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic, plus appropriate tags.


(Same as above, except that category 2 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic only)

Search queries for each scenario:


Scenario 1 can be found with [music][identification-request]
Scenario 2 and 3 can't be searched, since category 2 and 3 are not distinguishable, as we only have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic, plus series tag or other tags.
Scenario 4, 5, 6 are not searchable, since we can't tell apart questions in category 2 and 3.
Scenario 6 is only searchable for non-series-tag (like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production), with the observation that https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions don't use those tags.
Scenario 7 can be found with [<series tag>][music]




Scheme 1b: Replace https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requesthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification for category 1 and 2, following the previous scheme of tagging soundtrack identification questions with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request)

Tagging scheme:


Category 1 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification
Category 2 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification, plus series tag
Category 3 is tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic, plus appropriate tags.


Search queries for each scenario:


Scenario 1 and 2 can't be searched, since category 1 and 2 are both tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification, and differentiated with the existence of series tag, which can't be excluded in the search.
Scenario 3 can be found with [music].
Scenario 4 can be found with [tag:music-identification].
Scenario 5 can be found with [<series tag>][music-identification].
Scenario 6 can be found with [<series tag>][music]
Scenario 7 can't be searched, since search syntax does not support A and (B or C).


The search syntax is simplified for some queries, compared to the queries in scheme 1a. However, scenario 7 is no longer searchable.

Scheme 2b: Replace https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requesthttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification for category 1, following the current scheme of tagging category 2 without https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request)

This scheme doesn't make sense, since the purpose of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/music-identificationmusic-identification is to put questions in category 1 and 2 in the same basket. The search queries are more or less the same as scheme 2a. No problem is solved by doing this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for this detailed post; it really helps clarify what's going on. I guess my major assertion is that our number one goal should be to distinguish category 1 from the other two categories, which is the reason for my proposal. I also don't think that scenarios 4, 5, and 6 are very common use cases, since scen 4 (cat 1+2) combines two very different types of questions that I don't think people usually want to combine; and all the people who know cat 2 (scen 5) for a series also know cat 3 (scen 6), and vice versa, meaning that cat 2+3 (scen 7) should work fine for them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin: There exist questions which ask to identify the series and the track with only the audio as clue. That's why I put up cat 4 in the list, but I guess such questions are off-topic as per the guideline? Cat 5 and 6 are rarely use, I agree, since the number of questions per series is small, but I think people might be interested in cat 3.


















It's been talked about in chat for a while, so let's do something about it!
I am volunteering to organise a European get-together for A&M if there is sufficient interest.

For the first phase of this adventure, we must first decide what we want to do and where we want to go. Thus I ask you readers to fill out this survey:

Note: Non-europeans may attend too if they wish. Beware flight costs though!
After a few weeks I will post a summary of the results of the survey here and expand on our options a bit more once we know what's reasonably achievable.

A while back, https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/q/18842/some folks on Math.SE were interested in knowing the "home site" of the voters in one of their moderator elections. Here, "home site" means "the SE site on which the user has the most reputation". I surmise that there were fears that unwashed masses of programmers were invading their site and ruining their elections.

As your site is undergoing our new design-independent graduation process, you'll be enjoying your own run of design-independent Community Promotion Ads! 

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


the site's twitter account
review blogs and research websites to keep on top of each new season
events, meetups, and conventions 
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in 


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 220 x 250 pixels
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 40 KB
If the background of the image is white, there must be a 1x1 border of not-white at the edges of the ad


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2595here.

Good Morning European A&M'rs.

It's been a week since the survey was put up and there have been a total 7 responses.

Where people hail from (Alphabetically):


France 1
Germany 1
Ireland 1
Netherlands 3
UK 2


https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgmsy.png

All Western Europe, so air/boat/train fares won't be too bad, hooray! This seems to satisfy most people's travelling arrangements too:


Anywhere in Europe 4
Surrounding/Nearby Countries 2
Dependent on personal circumstances at the time of the trip 1
English-Speaking Countries only


https://i.stack.imgur.com/7tT46.png

It makes sense for at least one person not to travel, so what do our mother countries have to offer?



France: 

French food! Japan expo! - the largest Japanese convention in Europe - Summer. (mentioned by 2 users)

Ireland: 

Eirtakon is the largest convention in Ireland, with >3000 attendees. There are some smaller cons too, but it's the main one of the year. There's not many otaku things in Ireland, but there are lots of pubs and tours if people want something different.

It'll probably rain.

UK

A lovely convention (Name not given)

Terrible beaches

MCM Comic con which isn't just anime, so there should be something for everyone (although I think seeing as we are an Anime site that should be ok :P) & includes a fun party at the end.

Lots of other things to do in london, that are not anime related - if people want to do other stuff.

Expensive.

Netherlands

TomoFair - 3rd October (Japanese Culture Event) [Unfortunately, I think this is probably too soon for people to be organised around]

AnimeCon - June 10th-12th in the Hague

Several conventions

beaches

lovely bars 

sightseeing spots. 

cosplay meet-ups in parks - we could easily gather at one of those. 

4 people from here - of which 3 will probably go (3 answered the survey)

Germany

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Other Events Suggested

"Kidnapping Toshinou Kyouko and putting them in a Tomato Onesie" >:(



In terms of organization & events, it seems maybe having a flexible itinerary would be best, where we could override it if the group wanted to. Or meet and have a backup itinerary.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRuH0.png

It looks like not many are interested in doing a trade/swap - so perhaps interested users could organise any of this beforehand.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/kg4gw.png

Most people are uncertain about cosplaying - but no one selected the option where they didn't want cosplay at all:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/0JSWg.png

--

Things to consider:


I'm a tomato and I don't want to get squished
fear of heights
Avoid comiket-sized crowds (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ermNqkUUiJwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ermNqkUUiJw for reference)
Joint booking of accommodation could be useful. [Note - I don't want to be responsible for this, but if you would like to do amongst yourselves, that's fine]




I think from this, the best options are either the UK or Netherlands.
In the coming days I will put up another survey after researching what particular events we could go to & such.

Please feel free to comment on these results and/or suggest additional info for the next stage.

Cultural Height: When the next Death Note Question is asked.
Background: in the anime Death Note the titular item and those who own one follow a set of http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note56 Rules. For some reason people ask questions on how to kill certain people in certain ways or certain situations of use that were never in the anime.

A few months ago, the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monmusu-questmonmusu-quest was created. This appears to be for https://vndb.org/v5657the VN "MonMusu Quest". Just now, I created the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monmusumonmusu for the anime http://myanimelist.net/anime/30307/Monster_Musume_no_Iru_NichijouMonster Musume no Iru Nichijou (because the full title was longer than 25 characters, and this is the standard abbreviation). 

Are these two things in any way related? Should they share the same tag? 

If not, somebody who knows stuff about these two series should put a bit of disambiguating information in the tag wiki excerpts for future reference.

(I would research this myself, but, you know, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/25893/spiders.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou" (the anime) and "MonMusu Quest" (the VN) related?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I haven't played monmuse quest, but I believe they are unrelated


















The two titles are unrelated.


Monmusu Quest is set in a medieval setting, and the hero sets out on an adventure with the ideal of having monster girl and human coexist together peacefully. However, not all monster girls can be reasoned with, so he has to fight against quite a number of them on his adventure.
Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is set in present day, about the life of a man with monster girls on cultural exchange.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Awesome. I added a short bit to each of the tag wiki excerpts.


















In the past, we had tag bounties before and I would like to bring them back. They draw attention to older anime and it might serve to increase user participation. This meta post will serve to gauge interest in a monthly tag bounty as a community feature and who wants to provide the rep points needed for the bounties.

The tag bounties that I have in mind, however, will not only focus attention on older anime, but also on currently running shows. I believe that this will attract newcomers and not just old-timers. 

If we are to have regular tag bounties, I propose that it should follow the format we had in the past. Examples include:


https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2305/april-2015-bounties-for-tags-sports-anime-2005-presentApril 2015 Tag Bounties
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2243/february-2015-bounties-for-tags-summer-2011-showsFebruary 2015 Tag Bounties
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2342/may-2015-bounties-for-tags-visual-novels-and-adaptations-thereofMay 2015 Tag Bounties


It would also need to loosely follow Senshin's original https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2227/proposal-bounties-for-tagsproposal for Tag Bounties. 

In the past, he would be the one coordinating these events. Unfortunately, he has been busy lately and I think we as a community should pick up where he left off. That means that anyone should be able to coordinate these Tag Bounty events, should they choose to, with a maximum of one event per month. The theme should be http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-discussed in our chatroom, with the mods having the final say in everything.

So, who would be interested in a monthly tag bounty event? Who wants to contribute the bounties in these events?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Monthly Tag Bountiesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's less that I've been busy and more that they just didn't seem all that effective to me. The particular way I was doing them (picking a theme or feature and then attempting to specify all the anime with that theme/feature) was also somewhat labor-intensive. I'll add that the reason that I focused mostly on older stuff was that the newer stuff tends to get asked about relatively organically, whereas older stuff just kind of doesn't.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For me, seasonal tag bounties aren't that satisfying to reward - Something that rewards/encourages good questions is more likely to make me give a bounty in general. So for me, I would give bounties to a 'qs you may have missed' style event - or some event with a particularly interesting theme. Just my 2 centsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(To be clear, the point of the tag bounties thing was to ensure that we have as many tags in the system as possible, thereby circumventing the problem of users coming to the site, trying to ask a question, finding no tag for their anime, and then leaving. I agree that awarding bounties for questions that are actually good in some sense is more satisfying, but it doesn't actually solve this particular problem.)


















https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2605/1530Now that we know there's enough interest, let's start filling in the details.
First up on the to-decide list is the venue/event that we can meet up at. This way, we get an A&M Meetup AND another fun event - that can be enjoyed together or individually.
There were some strong suggestions in the survey, but we don't know which one is best for everyone. Therefore, this post is for suggesting the venue you would like the Great A&M EU Meetup to be located.

Feel free to elaborate on the suggestions you gave in the survey.
Obvious events are conventions / anime gatherings - but feel free to suggest anything we might find interesting! Please keep the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2605/1530Locations of our users in mind though.
You can promote your choice through pictures, videos, long passages of text, cookies, whatever!

The weekends tends bit be a bit slow in chat despite the spikes in traffic we get on Sundays. I thought, why not spend a day on a weekend once a month to watch some anime (related) movies? 

Partially in the spirit of our previous https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2451/come-have-a-private-little-academia-2-post-premier-community-watching-party-withLittle Witch Academia premiere screening, I'd is to introduce people so some of the anime media (that's not TV anime) that you usually don't often get a chance to see. This proposed event also serves are a way for current users to introduce those they know, who also enjoy anime, to our community.

Some potential prospects for watching are: 

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/patema_inverted/Patema Inverted

https://i.stack.imgur.com/2VQ3N.jpg


  Time of Eve director Yasuhiro Yoshiura is a perspective-twisting sci-fi adventure about two kids separated by opposite gravities. Patema lives in an underground world of tunnels, the long-abandoned ruins of a giant industrial complex. Though she is a princess, she is held back by the rules imposed by the elders of her clan. One day when she is exploring in a forbidden zone, she is startled by a strange bat-like creature and tumbles headlong into a void - and out into the wide open world above the surface, a place with reversed physics, where if she let go she would "fall up" into the sky and be lost forever. Age is a student on this surface world, a totalitarian society whose compliant population has been brainwashed against the "sinners who fell into the sky." When he spies Patema hanging upside-down from a tree, he pulls her down to safety, struggling with all his might to keep her earthbound as she grips on to him for dear life. Together their weights cancel each other out, and once they master the art of navigating competing gravitational forces, they set out to evade the leaders of Age's world and discover the secret that keeps their worlds apart


http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_kingdom_of_dreams_and_madness/Kingdom of Dreams and Madness

https://i.stack.imgur.com/I16so.jpg


  A documentary about Hayao Miyazaki's life and Studio Ghibli  


http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_letter_to_momo/Letter to Momo

https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDTsy.jpg


  From the creators of Ghost in the Shell comes a wonderfully expressive and beautifully hand drawn animated tale that combines bursts of whimsy and kinetic humor with deep felt emotion and drama. The last time Momo saw her father they had a fight - and now all she has left to remember him by is an incomplete letter, a blank piece of paper penned with the words "Dear Momo" but nothing more. Moving with her mother to the remote Japanese island of Shio, Momo soon discovers three yokai living in her attic, a trio of mischievous spirit creatures that only she can see and who create mayhem in the tiny seaside community as she tries desperately to keep them hidden. But these funny monsters have a serious side and may hold the key to helping Momo discover what her father had been trying to tell her. A Letter to Momo was seven years in the making, and the handmade animation is superb, from the painstakingly rendered serenity of the island's Shinto shrines to the climactic finale - a frantic chase featuring thousands of squirming, morphing ghosts and spirits that is the best cinematic flight of supernatural fancy in many years. 


http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tatsumi_2011/Tatsumi 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ISGFi.jpg


  A story based on the life and short stories of Yoshihiro Tatsumi, a mangaka known for his gekiga style of alternate Japanese manga.


Proposals and suggestions for other movies are welcome as well. Feel free to leave it here.

I'd like to start using community activities such as this to better develop relations between current users, encourage more active discussion in the realms of anime and manga, and also allow for more opportunities for non-users to get a chance to better know our site and community.  

The format would be pretty simple, every first weekend of the month we would have two of these watching session via https://rabb.it/Rabb.it. There will be two sessions to accommodate users from different time zones. Users can vote on what to watch beforehand and invite their friends to come watch and, perhaps afterwards, stop by discuss the movie afterwards in our http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-chatroom. Explicit write permissions will be give to new users who wish to participate, but do not have the necessary 20 rep to talk in chat.

Given the the session is a shared stream, there will be a minimum bandwidth speed requirement for optimal viewing experience. We can do some test sessions before starting to ensure there are no problems with your viewing experience (i.e. lag, dropped, frames). 

With all this said and done, would anyone be interested in such as session? IT doesn't have to be a big event with a lot of people. This event primarily for your enjoyment. What do you say? Are you interested?

@Hakase found this minor graphical error on Firefox:



The bug in question can be traced to this bit of CSS:

.topbar .hidden-text { 
position: absolute; 
top: -200px; 
}


A quick solution suggests increasing the "top" value beyond the user's screen height/width like so:

.topbar .hidden-text { 
position: absolute; 
top: -100vw; /* vh is fine, too */
}


Alternatively, @Unihedron proposed a better solution relying purely on CSS, eliminating the need for the "hidden text" span. See the example for the standalone Inbox icon:

.topbar .topbar-icon.icon-inbox:after {
    content: "Inbox";
}
.topbar .topbar-icon {
    /* ...original line code... */
    text-indent: -100vw; /* Collapses the original line */
}

Since screen readers usually chooses not to ignore text in `display:none;`, other sites take this approach in implementing blind mode as well.


















We decided that https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/457/6166unanswerable questions are allowed. Questions about future events within a series are considered on-topic. These questions should be answered as objectively as possible, but in the end they would be opinion-based until actually information comes along. So where do we draw between these questions and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/26185/chp801-sanji-wanted-alive-onlythis question for example?

In that One Piece question, OP asked for clarification on Sanji's wanted poster. This information is not known at this point, but will be addressed as the story progresses. I have to admit that at first I too wanted to close this question as opinion-base, but I ended up retracting my vote, because it is still about a future event. So where do we draw the line? When does a question go from being about a future event, to being opinion-based?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where do we draw the line between "unanounced future event" and "opinion based"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know jack about One Piece, but the question you linked seems reasonable. I would probably edit the question slightly to alter or remove the line about "do you guys have any theories" to ward off reflex-close-voters, and then leave the question be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, as I figure I must have posted about somewhere before, there is a bright-line difference between in-universe and out-of-universe "future events", and the only ones we should even maybe be concerned about are the latter.


















Although this is not a recommendation on what to do, it might be useful to keep in mind, for the things we are going to do. As I am assuming most if not all of us will be dependant on public transport.

Accommodations in the surrounding area

For the people that still require a place to stay, here are some suggestions. They are pretty cheap, on a not to long of a distance from the station/city center/ animecon. Take note that going with groups tends to be cheaper. The total price is based on a Thursday till Monday stay. And the tourist tax tends to be €5.50/ person. 

- http://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-atlantic-den-haagNH Atlantica


1 person 109/night  - 3 persons 
Totaling on €558 for 3 people included tax
Special: 5% discount can be obtained through me.
30 minutes away from Anime con / 20 minutes away from city center

If you need any help in regards of accommodations, transport, routes feel free to give me a message, as ill most likely be able to help.

I will also offer all our A&M members that come visit a free drink on the 10th of June. Why? Well, it happens to be my birthday on June the 10th. So I think it is fairly fitting ;)

Event Title: Visit http://tomatoworld.nl/nl/Tomato World

What day(s): TBC

Where: Tomatoworld ,
Zwethlaan 2 , 
2675 LB Honselersdijk, Nederland 

Details: A tour of approximately 1.5 hours an educational advisor will learn you everything about Dutch horticulture in general and in particular about the tomato. Special interests such as technology, the growing methods or just for sustainability can be indicated in the application. 

50 euro for a tour + 8per person which is a bit high for a silly event, but I could email and see if we can do a self-guided tour for less.

Event Title: Find the A&M ULTIMATE SHRINE MAIDEN
https://i.stack.imgur.com/6j6Pjm.jpg
What day(s): Probably either day of the convention, but TBC
Where: at the convention
Details: It's likely this event will be on again this year, although perhaps under a different theme. Here's the extract from the http://www.animecon.nl/program/events/other-events/challenge-coursecon website:

This event will be a series of mini games where several of your abilities will be put to the test. All games will train you to become a true Shrine maiden.
Are you up for the challenge? Do you have the courage, knowledge, physical strength and foolishness to pull through? Come, then we will watch as you struggle towards the finish!
During this event you can join in and participate at any given time. In order to lighten the pain we will hand out pric[z?]es to all participants.
What’s with the long name? Our philosophy is ‘The longer the name, the better the event’. The past few years we also had the ‘Super Golden Sparkling Idol Training’ and the ‘Super Golden Banzai Challenge Course’. I
Is there anything to win? To reward participants for their great efforts we will be giving away mini prizes to those that survive!
Can I participate together with friends? Participation is very flexible, you can participate solo or together with friends.

Event Title: Pub Quiz
What day(s): (Most likely) Friday from 9 to 11.
Where: Convention center
Details:

A pub quiz is all about having a good time while having a nice drink with friends. The setting is usually a bar or pub and there will be several rounds of questions which are worth points. The rounds  can be in theme, like a picture round, a music round and an Animecon themed round.
In between rounds there will be a short break so the judges can collect your answers and count the points per team. Teams are limited to five persons per team, this is to keep things fair as more people probably know more answers.
There can be as many teams as the room (and security) permits, it is also possible to join during the later rounds.

We're all members of the best Q&A site in town so I reckon we can do pretty good in this quiz! This is my personal favourite event of conventions. There's also prizes if we do well :D
Note: There may be an age restriction of 18 if there is alcohol being served.

I have come across a few questions that are already closed but have an accepted answer. Being relatively new here, I'd thought I'd ask this question.

Examples: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/26443/anime-with-a-red-haired-female-protagonist-who-is-like-a-mutantHere, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/26079/looking-for-an-ecchi-manga-in-which-the-students-of-a-school-arent-allowed-to-where being the more recent cases (there are definitely more [actual questions that are not the usual image search requests, usually id-reqs])

My question comes from the fact that the question has too scant details for a normal question and answer (as per guidelines), thus invoking the close votes. Yet, despite that, it is answerable (as can be seen from the fact that there is an accepted answer.

One of the questions I have voted to close myself, which resulted in my consideration of voting to reopen, but I am not sure. 

There are of course repercussions - being unsearchable is one (I'm not familiar enough to know if there are more) and perhaps a small detail is all that's needed for a potential asker to link it to their memory to search for a similar (and scantly detailed) question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should closed questions with accepted answers be reopened?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Question should be reopened only if the question improved itself rather then based on its answer or being accepted.


















We don't close questions based on the answers, nor do we reopen them on such basis.

Even if the question has an acceptable answer, if it's off-topic it's off topic, and it should be closed. A closed question is also a signpost for future visitors that say "See this question? We don't want questions like that", which is still true about the question, regardless of the answer it may have.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sorry for the late reply but I was away for awhile. What about questions that "have too little detail to be answered" but yet in the face of it being so it has been? The problem is that "too little detail" is an opinion, but "ability to be answered" is a fact. (ie the reason the question is closed is invalid)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Tyhja: "Too little detail" according to our [criteria](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions). It's not an opinion as much as it is a consensus by the community. The fact that someone answered it doesn't mean it fits the criteria set forth by the site.


















The latest post id is roughly 26600 at the time of writing.


The number on the Site Stats panel on the front page shows that we currently have 6557 questions and 8745 answers on our site, or around 15300 non-deleted posts in total.
Apart from questions and answers, as far as I know, tag wikis and tag excerpts are also identified by post id. A quick query on SEDE shows that there are around 1500 posts with PostTypeId = 3, 4 or 5.
There are a few gaps in the progression, totaled up to around 6000 ids: 934 → 1929 (996 ids, not accessible), 3974 (beta information), 4018 (site scope), 10160 → 11154 (995 ids, not accessible), 11751 → 12746 (996 ids, not accessible), 15640 → 16636 (997 ids, not accessible), 17353 → 18351 (999 ids, not accessible), 24612 → 25609 (998 ids, not accessible)
As confirmed by https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/users/27/madara-uchihaour community moderator, there are roughly 3700 deleted posts in total.


It might be interesting in knowing why there are gaps in the ids, but that should belong on a different question. Ignoring the tag wikis and gaps, there are a total of 19000 posts ever posted on our site, and 3700 posts (around 19.5% of total number of posts) are deleted, which means roughly 1 in 5 posts are removed.

(While the numbers may not be frequently updated, at this scale, we can assume that the result of the calculation does not deviate too much from the actual number).

Can we have a breakdown of:


The number of questions/answers deleted for each type?
Tag distribution of the deleted questions?
Are the questions deleted by roomba process, or are they deleted by manual delete votes (moderator or power user alike)?
Closure status of the deleted questions?
(... or anything interesting that might help us move the community forward?)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5About 1 in 5 posts (questions/answers) are removed from site. Can we have a breakdown of reason for deletion?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not easily possible to differentiate between roomba deletions and manual deletions (deletions aren't in SEDE, and site search doesn't let you search by "who deleted this thing"). JNat would probably be able to answer this, though, since he has magic employee powers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin: Some/All of the deleted posts are in PostsWithDelete table on SEDE. However, except for the post id, post type, parent post and creation/deletion date, all other information are wiped. The numbers also don't quite match up with my estimation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh man, they [added that](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/266431/) since the last time I looked through the list of tables. brb writing queriesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mod searching for `deleted: yes` gave me 3,736 results. I don't know what the other 6k are, but they aren't deleted posts.

Nonetheless, even 3.7k is around 15% of all deleted posts, which is still disturbing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha: I have asked about the other 6k on Super Meta: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/267921/what-are-these-mysterious-gaps-in-the-progression-of-post-idb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Based on experience on another minor site, I'd say most of them are roomba'd because of off-topic/unclear (here mostly on speculative future events, bad identification request). Sometimes there are obvious NAAs by new users who can't comment and think this is a forum for discussion. However, this is only my personal opinion, since I'm nowhere near to mod tools.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka: I completely agree with your observation, though it is better to have some concrete number to look at.


















So while going through the review queues, in particular "Low Quality Posts" I often come across answers such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/26597/34this one (https://i.stack.imgur.com/JeDm8.pngimgur mirror).

Ideally what seems the best fit is putting this "We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.[...]" plaque there, but I don't have the reputation to do that.

Now I could vote for deletion, but


I don't want to do it using the "without comment" option, because I feel it doesn't give the users a chance to react and they wont learn from it. 
What I often end up choosing is "This is commentary on another post, not an answer" but the text doesn't really capture what I want to express. At least as a new user I would not immediately understand from this that I'm supposed to write longer, better researched answers.
I could choose the no comment option and then write a more fitting comment myself, but that's a pain, even if I started using the https://stackapps.com/questions/2116/autoreviewcomments-pro-forma-comments-for-seAutoReviewComments userscript. And we can't really expect every reviewer to do this, for such a common problem, no? It also wouldn't allow for 'stacking' of the same comment from multiple reviewers, because everyone would likely write slightly different text


I could just vote down, but a) that's not available as an option in this queue (isn't this what moves it to review in the first place?) and b) it also wouldn't help the user to know what's wrong.

Or am I supposed to flag these? As what then?


"not an answer" doesn't fit because it is an answer, just not a good one.
"very low quality" doesn't really fit since while it may not be good, it could be salvaged if the user was told how.
in need of moderator intervention? But then we get back to me having to write or have ready a template text for this way too common case.


Currently I end up skipping many of these questions, which seems like a waste of time for both me and other reviewers. What am I missing here, I can't be the only one with this problem? The fact, that my example answers was deleted while I was typing this means that this is apparently really the way to go, but how does the user then know what they have to do better next time? Do they get an "RTFM" with their deletion?

I'm aware there is a very similar question https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/910/should-answers-without-explanations-be-removedhere however it only addresses what would happen afterwards (and there seem to be deleted comments, so I don't completely understand what happened there).

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1112/when-do-i-flag-low-qualityThis one also goes in a similar direction, but from that I would say the answer is to flag and write a comment for another reviewer, is that really it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to handle salvageable low-quality answers in review queueb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the image mirror senshin. Gao [pointed out in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/24679452#24679452) that since the user of the example answer had not even seen the anime in question, this answer might indeed be considered not salvageable. I'm inclined to agree, but the general question remains. I'll add an additional example, once I find another one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In [one case](http://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/17345/revisions), while admittedly probably not low quality to _that_ extent, an answerer only gave a one-sentence answer with the link. Since I thought they had the right idea anyway, I edited the answer to include the relevant section from the link. That said, in this case I had a reasonably good idea of what the OP's intentions were, and the edit I had to make was minimal. In an answer like the one that was converted to a comment [here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/25792/2604), such a process would be significantly harder.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The example answer is not salvageable, since the post itself doesn't contain much value in the first place. I would just delete it outright - comment optional. Salvageable posts should 1) provide a (full/partial) answer to the question 2) in cases of controversial claim, provide evidence to the claim 3) is readable by people who don't necessary follow the series. A post which requires too much effort to salvage should just be deleted to save community's effort to maintain them.


















Here on the site, we get a number of identification-type questions by unregistered users that are tolerated at best. From time to time there are that unregistered users just abandon these account and their questions, because they might have loss their session cookie.  

Currently, it's takes a bit of effort to differentiate the ones who are unregistered from the ones that are at a glance. You have to navigate directly to their profile in order to check for the "(unregistered)" label. Having some distinctive representations like an italicized, can be a noticeable and subtle way of indicating this.

Being able to differentiate between registered and unregistered users can help in a number of ways on this site:


Saves time when dealing users that make very low-quality (i.e. shit) posts, by not having to navigate to their profile to check (current precedence states that unregistered users making very low-quality post will deleted with little to no exceptions)
Makes new, unregistered users more aware (visually) that their account is a bit different than regular accounts. Hopefully converting them to become registered users.


Some users lose their cookie sessions and end up creating an account, but cannot accept an answer until a merge request is made and completed. Some time the new user registers a new account and asks the same question, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/26551/these https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/26548/two
Many new users who are not familiar with the SE format are unaware of the differences and most of the time don't bother to find out. Adding a help tooltip that basically https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/68524/what-does-it-mean-when-someones-an-unregistered-userhelps describe what an unregistered user means can potentially improve new user experience in understanding that their account has a volatile lifespan
Sometimes users that don't know better might also end up creating multiple unregistered account with the same name



Some potential side effects may include possible user discrimination based on account types, but for the part this community isn't the type to participate or encourage this type of behavior. Therefore I don't believe it any users will refrain from giving an unregistered users votes or refraining from answering their questions because they are unregistered.

The intent of this request is to promote better user experience by highlighting to new users the volatility of unregistered accounts, through representing an an unregistered user's display name with italics and adding a tooltip on their profile page, explaining what being an unregistered user means.

The general consensus for questions is that you do not have to avoid spoilers.

As for the title, it just as stated in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/47/1458the post you linked.


  The rule I've always followed is to include spoilers in your title only if it's required for the title to be searchable, and clearly indicate what the question is about. In other words, if you can make a good title without spoilers, do so; otherwise include spoilers. A good title is more important than spoilers. After all, the ignore tag feature will allow users to ignore any tags in a series they wish to avoid spoilers about.


I am not to sure how you see your replacement with Shinigami And Character as:


Why did the Shinigami Kill the character? would not make for a very good title
Why did Shinigami Kill L Which shinigami are we talking about? 
Why did Rem Kill him? killed whom?


All with all, in this case including the spoiler makes for the best title, and also would most likely be the one most searched for when looking for a answer to such a question

A good title is always more important then avoiding spoilers

Can it still be searchable maybe?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BCLC Then what would you make your title. Keep in mind, the title still needs to describe your question.

Does this also work in chat? Will the question titles not pop up if I have the tags hidden on Stack Exchange? As far as I can tell all questions that get posted are echo'd into chat regardless of your settings.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MichaelMcQuade No, your tag-hiding settings on the main site do not carry over into chat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh I forgot all about this. Haven't been so into anime se much past few years. 'The rule I've always followed is to include spoilers in your title only if it's required for the title to be searchable' - Seriously why? Virtually no subreddit will ever tolerate this. Why is stackexchange different? What's wrong with senshin's answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'general consensus' --> says who? Can we do a poll? I happen to know on other sites like say reddit or myanimelist this is extremely forbidden. They even go a step further to say you should say what kind of spoiler you're hiding eg season X spoiler, manga spoiler, spoiler for another show, etcb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BCLC Refer to the [Faq post](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/46/what-should-our-policy-be-regarding-spoilers?noredirect=1&lq=1) But if you feel that it should be re-addressed, you can always start a new meta post regarding it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dimitrimx What do you mean? This is the post. senshin explains why we should not have spoilers in the title.


















I don't really agree with the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2655/1908other answer.

I strongly advocate for avoiding spoilers in titles except when they are really, genuinely, 100% necessary for the post to make any sense. Keep in mind that when you google for an answer to some anime-related question, google indexes both the title and the body of the post, so stuff is still findable even if you're somewhat roundabout in the title. While I imagine the title is granted more weight, avoiding spoilers in the title still likely does little harm. I think that the benefit of avoiding spoiling users' experience with various shows outweighs the cost of losing some descriptiveness in the titles.

I also want to point out that while the claim "the ignore tag feature will allow users to ignore any tags in a series they wish to avoid spoilers about", is technically correct, it does not propose a practically useful course of action. Here's why:

Suppose that I'm Joe Blow, some dude who's only seen Naruto. One day, I come to Anime.SE and ask some questions about a Ninetales Uchiha Hokage Rasengan. While I'm here, I see some questions on the front page about this thing called "Death Note". That sounds like a pretty metal sort of thing, so I figure I'm going to go and watch that when I get a chance. But! As I'm browsing the front page, I see another question title that reads "Why did Rem kill L?" that's tagged with [death-note]. And then I watch the first few episodes of Death Note, and suddenly the context of that question becomes clear - I know who Rem is, I know who L is, and now I've been spoiled on the fact that Rem is going to kill L at some point!

There's the problem - users cannot, practically speaking, ignore tags for all shows they may want to watch in the future. If you know in advance that you want to avoid spoilers for X, sure, ignore [X]. But if you don't, what can you do to avoid spoilers? If the spoilers are right there in the titles, there's effectively nothing you can do. And that's the problem with putting big spoilers in titles.

Yesterday I came along this post https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/26605/1458https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/26605/1458 
I noticed a comment requesting some more information, followed up by a comment providing this information. As I had some spare time I decided to edit this information into the question, and flag the 2 comments as obsolete.

After one of my flags got declined today, I decided to ask for some clarification in the http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/24878484#24878484chat. This led to a short discussion with http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/28179reverse Kyouko, with the conclusion that we both have a different stance on the topic. Which brings me to the question:

How should we handle obsolete comments?

As stated in https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/19756/259147This Meta


  When should comments be deleted?
  Comments are temporary "Post-It" notes left on a question or answer. You should not expect them to be around forever: Once a clarification has been made, an edit added to the post to include new information, or the issue in the comment is otherwise resolved, it is subject to deletion


Our current moderation whoever is maintaining a https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/77379/259147Non-deleting culture


  Comment deletion is completely intransparent. There is no way to keep track of deleted comments, or protest their deletion. As long as this is the way it is, I don't think there should be a culture of deleting comments among mods, except for the generally accepted exceptions where it takes place already: When comments are rude, or a conversation gets completely derailed and off-topic. 


And all tough I can find myself in the above mentioned method as well. I do still think this is more directed at bigger comment threads which is not a common occurrence on A&M as of yet.

The way we handle these comments now, might also influence the way our community http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/24879433#24879433grows and the http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/24879591#24879591quality going along with this.

So what is the community opinion on this? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to handle Obsoletion in comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Current moderation" being just me.


















I delete a lot of flagged obsolete comments. (Including one of the comments on that question, which I have just undeleted for clarity)

I don't mind deleting them if they are truly obsolete and provide information that is in no way useful anymore.

In this case there's a user asking the Asker to provide some information - which is then edited into the question. I think that's a perfectly acceptable reason to delete the comments - there is no benefit whatsoever in keeping them there.

I think this is probably a bigger problem on other sites where they get much more flags - to the point of not being able to empty their queue. For now I'm happy to delete them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course, I have to have a different opinion to Reverse Kyoukob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Different opinions lead to different reactions. This post is also meant to create a more general handling of such flags. Otherwise I could just keep flagging the same comment a few times until the other one picks it up for a change and does delete it.


















In order to make the site continue to run successfully, it's important all reviewers know the correct way to approach posts. As part of this, we had a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2564/lets-take-a-look-back-at-our-site-policies-2015-editionpolicy review to see which were the policies that needed the most attention.The top voted policy to be reviewed was Explicit & Borderline Content. We will cover the other policies in the coming months.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/needs-clarificationneeds-clarification


  We've had a lot of run-in media on the site that would be considered
  either explicit or borderline (even though they are hidden behind a
  spoiler and/or have a NSFW warning). It's sometimes hard to tell if
  the piece of media is explicit or not. A set of guidelines and set
  procedures would probably help streamline things.
  
  Reason:
  
  Due to individual circumstances we're can't all agree on what's lewd
  and not. In the fine art, there's a (fine) line between art and
  pornography. Our personal upbringings shape how we think about these
  things. We need to find some point where we can agree on at least.


As mentioned by @Torisuda, there are two cases to be clarified here:


Questions about works which contain explicit/borderline material.
Questions containing explicit/borderline content.


Please use this meta to help us concretely decide our community's policy on this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Policy Clarification: Explicit & Borderline Contentb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With the first point are you referring to works like Kamuidori Alchemy Meister, Fate/Stay Night and Deardrops. particulary the last 2 which have seen non explicit versions/anime released of them or are you referring to echii themed anime/hentaib2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X I'm not sure what's different about those series, but I mean ecchi/hentai anime as a whole.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5all 3 are Visual Novels with Explicit content in the form of descriptions of sexual acts but said content is not the main purpose of the Visual Novels. with the last 2 they have both had all ages versions of them which have had the explicit content removed and both have had anime adaptions (Fate/Stay Night = multiple series, Deardrops = OVA), when you say "Questions about works which contain explicit/borderline material" Fate/Stay Night and Deardrops can be counted because in their original forms had explicit material.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont.) Kamidori is just the only Eushully Visual Novel i know of which is in english and doesn't have a weird premise (one such title the main character makes a contract with a goddess of fertility and the children he and the heroines have are used to fight in the game) but Eushully has the Battle Goddess Series which i assume has more plot than explicit content like Kamidori


















Sexually explicit content

Sexually explicit content should be a no go as per site policy in both questions and answers. unless censored and answerable in a way that can comply with these policies and is handled https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263/are-adult-movies-as-far-as-industry-actors-etc-are-concerned-on-topicin a scientific way

Lets first define http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policysite policy, as this should be one of the main guidelines to adhere.


  Sexually Explicit Material. Accounts that use Stack Exchange to post sexually explicit or pornographic material, or links to it, will be suspended.


Considering that what people might find offensive differs per culture, I suggest following the http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Sexually_explicitIT law regarding sexually explicit content in connection with virtual worlds.


  [d]epictions or descriptions of: (1) sexual references; (2) full or partial nudity, including depictions of uncovered female breasts, aroused or unaroused male or female genitalia, and unrealistic or overly detailed genitalia; (3) bestiality; (4) sexual acts to or with minors (anyone under the age of 18); (5) sexual acts including, but not limited to, penetration/intercourse, and/or oral sex with or without another avatar or any other object, including overt sexual toys and/or sexual aids; or (6) sexual behavior that has a violent context." - https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263/are-adult-movies-as-far-as-industry-actors-etc-are-concerned-on-topicSummary List (TL;DR)


There for explicit visual depictions should never be allowed, without proper censorship. Taken that hentai is in fact animated pornography, it is safe to say that hentai is off topic as per site policy, unless censored and answerable in a way to comply with these rules as well, https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263/are-adult-movies-as-far-as-industry-actors-etc-are-concerned-on-topicin a scientific way.

Mild / borderline explicit content

(1) sexual references, including (6) scarce clothing, which does not yet include partial nudity. Think of panty shots, skimpy clothing, naked bodys hidden by a cloud. Should be on topic, given that they are contained inside a >! (spoiler) area, and visibly warn the user of their content. This should both count for answers and questions alike. And were possible, especially in answers, avoided if possible.

Graphic content (gore and violence)

As there currently is no policy in place in regards to such graphics contents, and avoiding those in anime is nearly impossible. I suggest allowing this content, if properly hidden from direct few, with a visual disclaimer warning the user of its content, and if possible should be avoided. Especially in answers

Currently there does not seem to be a rule regarding this on the site (correct me if I am wrong). There for I suggest the following:

Uncensored Graphic content such as, depicted murder, assault, suicides and or tortures. Or any other scenario leading to injury, bloody weapons, extensive blood effects or anything similar of nature. Should be contained in a >! (spoiler) area. and visibly warn the user of their contents.

Answers should try to avoid this content as much as possible, but in case this is not possible, adhere to the above mentioned rules as well.

Which I based upon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violenceGraphical content as mentioned on wikipedia.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Assume a question is asked about the [Sono Hanabira OVA](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11567) asking how it may be similar/different from the [Original Visual Novel](https://vndb.org/v925). to my recollection (need to double check my sources) the difference between the 2 is when Reo and Mai are intimate (ie. in the Visual Novel they are intimate when Reo is sick while in the OVA it is when Mai is sick). considering the OVA is Hentai and some can see the Visual Novel as hentai to in the same way the first Fate/Stay Night would such a question be on/off-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X Such questions can be on-topic, if 1) the question is formated in a scientific way and 2) the answer can be phrased in a scientific way, and in both cases, if reference to the explicit series is required, clear visual notice should be given in regards to the potential unsuited content, and graphical content should be avoided at all cost.   TL:DR: Assuming that both can be phrased in a scientific way, this is on topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To put it simply, this means that asking non-explicit content from explicit series is okay, as long as there's a notice as precaution that the series is explicit? (Refer to questions like [tag:mnemosyne])b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka Yes. that is correct. Where Mild / borderline explicit content is a exception, if handled properly


















As I see it, we gotta compile a shortlist of bullet list items that would fit in one or very few lines in the side widget. We're dealing with lazy people here, so the longer each point, the more chance of tl;dr and we don't want that. In addition to the basic description, add a (?) button that shows a list of examples. Consider (the text within parentheses) as an example of that hint.

But perhaps we could have minor & major points like Kilua suggestsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't even take that 3-items rule into account when making this suggestion. The importance of various points is very different from work to work. I think we can't objectively judge whether a point is minor or major without knowing its importance, so we shouldn't try to enforce this overly vague minimum threshold. Let's make it at least 5/10/15 distinct points of description instead?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can't ask these new users to do too much all at once. The persona of typical id-req users are typically younger audiences, a lot of time they are ignorant of the site rules, structures, especially etiquette. They see anime and have as a sort of plaything that they have fun with when it interests them and tossed aside when they are bored of them. They come in with a general sort of naivety, asking for the world and expect it to be given to them without question. But instead they get pushed back and admonished for their actions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most of the time they are unwilling to find out and correct things in fear of antagonism, which can run pretty rampant in certain parts of community and subculture on the internet. By no means would I like the community to follow suit. Instead I'd like to make it easier for new users that don't understand the rules and culture an opportunity to help themselves, and be intrinsically rewarded in to process. Instead of forcing them to add certain thing, I feel that encourages them through simple examples to be more effective and less heavy-handed.


















Now that the deadline for conspiracy gifting draws near, we'd like to remind everyone of that deadline. It's time to get your presents on their way!

The weekends can get a bit slow here, so let's have an event this weekend! During the first Saturday (UTC) of this month, I'd like to invite members of our community and their friends to come watch some anime together.

Tentative name: The Basement Cellar Anime Club Cinema.

The steams will be done via the http://rabb.it/KrazerRabb.it using official sources such as Amazon Prime video, Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Funimation, where available. The format will be loose and friendly, and will last all day, so anyone can hop in and out at any time. Some potential titles to stream are: 


Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu
Mushishi
Space Battleship Yamato 2199 + movie
Bodacious Space Pirates + movie


Last week, we had a pilot session to test bandwidth and video/audio connection. We went through Patema Inverted, Time of Eve, and the entire first season of Full Metal Panic!

Those with an ADSL-equivalent connection speed should be fine. There are three video quality settings you can toggle based on your connection bandwidth, HD, SD, LD (being the lowest resolution). Video chat will be disabled, but you are free to use audio chat if you so prefer.

The session will extend to Sunday as well, where the topic is free. You can binge as much as you want as long as you want. Stocking up on snacks and drinks is recommended.

The start of the session and the currently playing series will be announced in our http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-main chatroom as well as our LINE group (give you LINE ID in chat for an invite). Request and recommendations will be taken all day Sunday. Come and have fun with us this weekend!

Please leave any feedback of the event here so we can assess if we should make this a more regular event. Also if you have a better name suggestion for the event, please leave it here as well.

This morning I stumbled upon a change in the review system, the reputation requirements have been raised.

With this change only 42 users (162 with the old threshold) can do Close, Reopen & Low Quality reviews.

What exactly is the point behind this?



I created a https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/386695/reviews-done-each-monthdata query that shows how many reviews are done per month. We can use this over time to visualize the impact of the new system.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's the Matter with these new rep requirements?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Users with their current reputation levels that will see that they need to be active on the site for about one more year to regain those privileges might decide to stop doing anything altogether. I don't think this change helps anything.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm one of those people.  This takes away most of what I enjoy doing on the site, there won't be a reason for me to visit as much anymore.


















Note: It seems that this change was a bug; see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2669/24this answer. While my answer below is not really valid, we can still expect that this change will happen eventually, and when it does the logic presented here will still be just as valid, so I am leaving it here.



The new reputation levels are the standard levels on graduated sites. Previously, we had the public beta levels, for which https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questionsclose votes were available at 500 rep (and, for instance, https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/trusted-userTrusted User at 4k). If you go to any other graduated site, the rep levels will be essentially the same (barring individual changes). 

This site has been ready to graduate for a while though, and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2594/congratulations-anime-manga-is-graduatingformally did so in September. The biggest immediate consequences of graduation are moderator elections and removing the "beta" label. After some time, the rep levels will also be raised (as it seems they have) and a custom site design will be added. This is part of the new https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-septemberdesign-independent graduation procedure which we are one of the first sites graduating through. 

I can't comment on why it took so long for the rep levels to be raised, but this was always understood to be part of the graduation process, and is not in any way unexpected.



Personally, I'm all for this change. We want to encourage more people to continue participating for longer on this site. Having rewards at higher levels serves this purpose. Previously, for many users on the site, once they passed 4k rep, there was nothing else obvious to aim for. Now we have things that even the highest rep users can still aim for. The new levels are still rather reasonable; it's completely possible to get to 3k in a couple months if you're relatively active.

From a practical standpoint we can easily still deal with close/reopen voting and other reviewing whether there are 42 users or 162 qualified; a question only needs 5 close votes, and 42 is pretty large compared to 5 already. In addition, this site has been around for some time and has some rather well-established policies on closure. We want the people who are voting to close/reopen questions to at least be aware of these rules before voting. A user with 500 rep could plausibly not know any of these rules, as getting to that level only takes a few days of activity at minimum. A user with 3k rep will likely have been around for a while and probably at least knows enough to intelligently decide on these things. Sure, some users in the 500-3k range are qualified and know the rules, but even with just 3k users there's not going to be much difficulty getting things reviewed. At worst, it may take an extra few hours to get questions closed or reopened. The only front that we're lacking people on is answer deletion, and that's a rather rare case anyway.

With that said, I would like to remind and encourage everyone here to be voting on posts. If you read a good question or answer, upvote it. This is the best way to ensure that people here can maintain healthy reputation growth. In addition, I encourage everyone to ask good questions yourselves. There's been some complaints recently that good questions to answer are increasingly hard to find. However, few have taken the obvious step to counteract this of simply asking your own good questions. You can even https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/self-answeranswer your own question if you prefer. If you follow these steps, I expect you'll find that these rep levels are actually still within reach in a reasonable period of time.

Scripts are definitely part of the copyright of a work. Translated scripts are a little bit harder to pin down, because http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13050005/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/hollywoods-new-piracy-problem-stolen-scripts/copyright applies to an expression of an idea, rather than the idea itself.
In saying that, a site that provides transcripts of the script isn't necessarily illegal - if it has gotten permission from the rights holders. I don't believe any such site currently exists though, so we can probably blanket treat them as illegal sources.
Snippets of scripts probably come under fair use and it is okay to quote them, or link to a source that has an extract. The rules are undefined and fuzzy about length - but if you're not obviously taking too much, it's probably fine.
I think we should avoid linking these sites, but allow snippets to be quoted - giving the benefit of doubt to those who may have transcribed it from source for the answers.

It should be noted that whether or not you're a lawyer has little to do with our policy. Our policy isn't intended to enforce compliance with any particular copyright law, and copyright claims are handled by SE's legal team (which is unrelated to community moderation). The intent of our community moderation policies toward such questions is more as a show of goodwill towards the original creators of the content and to try to avoid certain classes of undesirable questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, but just in case anyone was taking this advice on a personal level


















Make site policies easier to read (Our words are too complicated. Let's make them simpler.)  https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/needs-reviewneeds-review

From time to time we get frustrated when users don't read the rules and post thing however they like. But should we really be blaming these people and just put out some blanket policy without attempting to see the bigger picture?

Not all fans of anime and manga speak English well. Despite being a primarily English language site, we're not always accommodating to ESL user. I believe that our site policies could use a once over to be more accommodate the reading level of these users. We should establish some simple criteria such as what the recommended reading level for the site to be and having a place where users can get a brief summary on our site policies in simple English.

Reason: 

Let's say you're someone from a non-English speaking country that just got into anime or manga, and you want to know more about the world of anime and manga. You find this site and realize that it's in English, you've had some exposure to it from school, but you haven't used it much. It's hard to grasp because the structure is different from your native language. You try your best but your question is not well received. You try to find out why, but your English is not good enough... so you just give up. 

Some of our policies are a bit wordy (I myself am to blame for some of it). Having to read through them can be a bit of a hassle to younger users and a bit of a struggle to ESL users. We should try to find ways to provide more simple explanations to these users. Hopely this will get them to better understand how our site works and how to go about using it. We should try to simplify our policies and by doing so hopefully it will make the site more accommodating to new users.

I have started FMA brotherhood recently and I want to follow its question. But then A&M have only one tag for it is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist, covering FMA manga, FMA anime and FMA brotherhood. But as most of us already know FMA anime and FMA brotherhood anime are different shows, so why not use two different tag for them? I even suggest to make three tag: one for manga, two for each anime, as FMA anime is also non canon to FMA manga but FMA brotherhood is.

I know its been discussed in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/308/should-multiple-continuities-have-individual-tags/309#309meta, http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/7248290#7248290chat before but seems like it still hold confusion if one want to follow one anime and not other.

We even have tag for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-gtdragon-ball-gt, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-superdragon-ball-super and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/akito-the-exiledakito-the-exiled, even when they are canon to main continuity but not for FMA brotherhood which is different show then FMA?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why do FMA and FMA brotherhood not have different tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I'm not sure having separate tags for this series is the best option, I agree that we should probably be consistent in our tagging approachb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AyanoSugiura both are different series and non canon to each other, so their should be some differentiation to identify each.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags exist to separate areas of expertise and both series are so similar in content that it was decided that if you know one, you shouldn't have trouble with the other. Or that's what I think happened. You could easily get up to speed by watching the other series if you know one already.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@HakashinouShinonouko this gives no opportunity to avoid one of them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think the intention to *avoid* either was ever in anyone's mind.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@HakashinouShinonouko There is a TV show Being human made in UK, then its reboot was made in US.  Now both Movies.se and scifi.se had two tags for them, one for each. Both series are similar in first season but changes a lot after it ( same like FMA), now you can't force someone to know being human US show too while answering being human UK. So making one tag is like forcing someone to know both before checking into that tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Someone told me it's because brotherhood anime is based on manga, and the manga is titled fullmetal alchemist, without brotherhood, so to avoid confusion (or to add them) we decide to only make one tag for all seriesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5maybe we can have [tag:fullmetal-alchemist-2003] and [tag:fullmetal-alchemist]?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ its already there in question itself, even with related chat discussionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're inconsistent on our policy of multiple continuities. If we were to do separate tags, brotherhood runs over the tag limit so we'll need to abbreviate it [tag:fma-brotherhood]. IMO It doesn't make much sense to make a dedicated tag for the manga as there is little to no difference from the anime adaptation. While we don't get many questions for gundam, the series falls under the same umbrella. On a related note, there might be a need for a general series tag for question involving multiple continuities. Instead of naming all the gundam titles, a [tag:gundam-uc] tag might be useful.


















I am wondering if I can ask for anime series suggestions and recommendations, or would that be to broad?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can I ask for anime suggestions here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No , read [here](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for more details


















I've tried editing the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618/what-picture-is-this-from-how-do-i-use-reverse-image-search-to-find-the-sourceWhere is this picture from? How do I use Reverse Image Search to find the source of an anime/manga image?
to try and get better hits on it by editing the title. However, it is most likely that doesn't really help. I was about to start dummy questions to link to the one above with more helpful titles such as "What picture is this from?" or "What anime is this from?" to ensure a better hit on the main reverse search question by acting as proxy.

We could also have some crazy long title with multiple combinations of the different questions but that would also reduce readability and make it less visible when actually searching that question.

I do not know if this is "kosher" and if we should do it, thus I post here instead.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to improve hit rate to suggestions on picture identification questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want users that seek reverse image search to find our post about reverse image search, the most straightforward way would be to post a comment with a link to it. This is the only foolproof method that doesn't require additional posts or configuring help popups.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase I think Tyhja means for question prediction when asking a question (if I've read it correctly), rather than searching the site themselvesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yes, I meant just that. That post won't appear coz the title length is very different.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, both of you are right. And I've tried entering similar titles for questions and not getting hits for suggestions, which results in this meta post.


















This site seems to bring with it a special issue: When asking a question both the suggested questions and sidebar are practically designated spoiler flashes. It's very difficult, when the content is targeted to the story you're asking about, in places where it's designed to be seen first, not to be in danger of glimpsing a peek at potentially massively horrific spoilers in questions titles.

Would it be possible to have Stack Exchange alter the behavior of certain features to avoid these spoilers? For example, have the suggested questions that appear when writing a question be collapsed at first?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would it be possible to have Stack Exchange alter this site's features to avoid spoilers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you don't want a story "spoiled", then... Don't read about it on The Internet until you're done reading/watching it! If you assume that the only way to properly enjoy the story is to find out details in the exact order that the author(s) intended, you can't be asking questions mid-way through... Alternately, if you want your reading/watching experience enhanced by the sort of perspective only The Internet can provide, then just embrace it and stop worrying.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In other words "We don't care about user experience of people who like you who have questions about things that occur in the middle of anime series, but don't want major events to be spoiled while asking the question. Instead, you should make a mental note of all questions and save them for months from now when you finish the series." In other words, this is a site for people who have finished watching the entire series or dont care about major events being spoiled while asking the question. Thanks for that info Shog.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I care a lot about you, Viz. But caring doesn't let me look into your mind and separate the details you're interested in knowing early from the *extremely-similar* details that you'd rather not know early. Spoilers are largely a personal matter; as you can see from the linked duplicate, folks here will *try* to avoid major plot events when possible, but ultimately what you find spoiling is up to you...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shog9 You're a smart man Shog, I've read some things you've written across the network, and Im sure you'll have a response that sounds great, to anything I say, but the fact is, I just asked about a UX improvement, and you immediately put a big red stamp on it and said "Sorry, but you just need to deal with the spoilers, or dont ask questions here. We cant avoid spoilers." - But by making the question suggestions a collapsed list, you could actually help not spoil series for people curious about certain details mid-way through.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would dare to estimate that a massive portion, 90% or more, of the questions asked on this site are asked while people are watching or reading a series, not after they're done. Avoiding spoilers somewhat, in the way I suggested, wouldn't be very hard for your team, and I find it interesting that you would so quickly shoot such an idea down, without even entertaining thought on such a feature. "Deal with spoilers or dont use this site." Isn't the most effective way for a person such as yourself to handle feature requests on a site such as this one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And we could also ruin the experience for folks searching for an answer. And create more duplicates. Neither is ideal for a site dedicated to dissemination of information. I can sympathize with you, but what you want runs counter to the core goals of both this site and Stack Exchange as a whole.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shog9 And that's a fair enough answer. I wasn't looking for sympathy, only solutions. There was a problem with the solution I suggested, I'm fine with that. I only took issue in the reasoning you provided.


















I realise the phrasing for this is a little odd, so I'll elaborate. The one tag I'm thinking of would be "recommendations".
Currently recommendation questions are not allowed under our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117/should-we-allow-recommendation-questionsconsensus. But are still popping up from time to time. They are also mistagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resourcesresources, etc.

My questions is therefore, is such a tag like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/recommendationsrecommendations a good idea? And there could be a similar popup like for id-requests, pointing users to the meta post describing how it isn't answered by our SE.

My idea is that such questions should be retagged as such and closed, or if the user asks and tags correctly, they will be pointed to the correct places.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have a tag that most likely result in the question being closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5^ IMO my reasoning there still applies, but if there's interest in revisiting the issue, we can discuss this again

Thanks @HashiramaSenju!

Today, I got in the mail, a hefty assortment of delicious-looking snax from Hashirama's home country. 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/cU9Md.jpg

Foreign snacks have always been a rare and delectable treat for me as there are a pletora flavors, textures, and ingredients out there waiting to be discovered. Some more healthier than others.

I've always wondered how Hashirama can subsist on just these snacks. Now I have an idea of how he does it and how delectable they are.

Additionally, I'm told there's another part coming and this is just an appetizer... Hmm I wonder what's in store for part 2! In the meantime, thanks for the yummy snax.

One thing about our fandom, as with any entertainment fandom, is that we get to collect figures, posters, wall scrolls, books, cups, plushies, pantsu1, and like any fandom it can be pretty expensive.

After sinking hundreds of dollars/rubles/caps into those 2 matching figma of Madoka Kami and Akuma Homura you'd want to have them outside their box so you can pose them in a loving embrace of one another, but at the same time you'd want to keep them well maintained or when the worst happens, be able to repair them.

since we already have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise would questions on Anime Merchandise Care/Maintenance/Self-Repair be on-topic? if not can we make them on-topic? if we can what guidelines should we set for questions and answers?

example questions:


  How to i restore color to my http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fabric-Wall-Scroll-Poster-Inches/dp/B00502DNQ6C.C Wall Scroll?





  How can i wash a http://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/3651/Nendoroid+Plus+Plushie+Series+44+Index.htmlGift Nendoroid Plus Plushie?





  How can i repair the joint in a http://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/5386/figma+Fubuki+Animation+ver.htmlFigma Figure?




1: i swear i've seen pantsu advertised in a JList email
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would questions on Anime Merchandise Care/Maintenance/Self-Repair be on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it would involve more knowledge on DIY stuffs rather than knowledge on anime and manga. I am also not quite sure whether people on our site has expertise in this topic or not. If you really has the problem yourself, and the rest agrees with a trial run, then we can put up such questions and see whether it would work out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @nhahtdh that is a separate area of expertise. The same information could be applied to a generic plushie or a non-anime wall scroll.


















I think the best approach is to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principleKeep It Simple. We should use a single tag for these related series.

I realise the benefits of being able to look up FMA:B rather than FMA, but it gets very complicated quickly - when is something a continuity? do we tag all the Dragonball series and all their movies? 

It also opens the floodgates for considering even more tags, consider https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/attack-on-titan-mangaattack-on-titan-manga , https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/attack-on-titan-animeattack-on-titan-anime , https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/attack-on-titan-junior-highattack-on-titan-junior-high and even https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/attack-on-titan-live-actionattack-on-titan-live-action. There may be questions about the series as a whole too. "Why are the titans attacking?" for example.



There aren't many questions for most series, the only ones that will benefit are the largest (FMA, is admittedly an example). Otherwise, we have 2 tags for maybe 3 questions (if even). 

This also means an increase in the amount of retagging we need to do, the amount of tags we fall behind on season-by-season, etc.



I think having less tags, while less convenient for searchers is the more practical approach.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As you mentioned, consistency is the key. Where is the line drawn between the need of a different tag being created than one not being? Why do some series (Fate series, or Dragon Ball series) have separate tags while others (FMA series, Evangelion series) don't? Shouldn't there be a more consistent approach? Maybe a well defined criteria which makes it specific as to whether a particular tag should be created or not, rather than it being handled separately, **or** the participation of the whole community in deciding whether or not a tag should be created via a poll or something of the sort?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this rule will force FMA: brotherhood watcher to know the old anime too. Which seems wrong as those two anime are non canon to each otehr and are different continuity. Related argument [Why FMA and FMA brotherhood didn't have different tag?](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2673/why-fma-and-fma-brotherhood-didnt-have-different-tag)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnkitSharma I don't know if this'll really force FMA:B watchers to know FMA (2003), because most questions specify 2003 vs FMA:B vs manga. Also, where does the manga fall on the 2003 vs FMA:B divide, because it's name fits with the 2003 anime but the canon is with FMA:B?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly specified in the middle of body? That means i have to read 20 question to sort out the 12 i really want to read?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnkitSharma Of the first 5 non-closed questions in the tag, 3 specify medium/series in the question or visible part of the text, and for the other 2 they're more generic so it doesn't matter, so it would take you just as long to tell from reading the question as telling what the question is would take you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fullmetall alchemist is a bit of a special case. I propose [tag:fullmetal-alchemist] for the canon version (i.e. both Brotherhood and the manga) and [tag:fullmetal-alchemist-2003] for the anime. By like I said, FMA is a bit of a special case where the canon manga name is the same as a non-canon anime name.


















I feel that we need a change. Our current policy on this makes things a bit vague and just seems lazy overall. I feel that the mods share some of the blame in their lack of action on the matter. 

Because this has been brought up multiple times, it's about time we make an attempt to take action on the matter. Just putting it off til later merely delay the inevitable.

Why should I care?

First off, I personally think it makes for bad policy to have the tags be inconsistent. It feels a bit lazy to lump the whole of one series with different continuities under just the umbrella of one tag. Having multiple tags to differentiate a series will make it easier for both asker and answers as these questions will better establish the context of which series on is referring to. This will better confine the scope of the question to only that series, making most question easier to answer as you don't have to cover all the continuities if the OP doesn't specify. 

Remakes and reboots fall under the same umbrella. Series like Hunter x Hunter and Ghost in the Shell often times change up the plot, alter scenes, and/or even add additional characters. Being able to make a distinction between the original from the remake can make answering one much easier, especially when you haven't seen one of them. This allows fans who are "experts" fans on one series to be able to seek out and cover the one that they are most familiar with.

What does this mean?

This doesn't mean every tag needs to be separated or be differentiated with an -anime, -manga, or -live-action suffix. It means we need to make a distinction between them. For example, by splitting https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist into "fullmetal-alchemist-2003" and "fma-brotherhood" we can better focus on easy particular continuity and not have to specify which one we're talking about each time. It's the same logic as not needing to include the title series title in the question title when posting a question to reduce redundancy. 

If a user asks about an event in a series with two different continuities (with a different outcome) and doesn't make a distinction as to which they are referring to, covering both might be require additional effort, especially if you've only seen one of them. It's a bit cumbersome to ask a Gundam Build Fighters specific question and need to differentiate it from the original Gundam or the Gunpla Builders Beginning G OVA, when all you have is the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundamgundam tag. A tag should refer specifically to a particular series rather than the franchise as a whole.

What we need is a clear set of guidelines to abide by. The an older series shouldn't be given precedence over a new one. If the titles are the same, we should add a date to both. If the difference between a manga and an anime is somewhat minor (no major divergences in the plot [e.g., the Angelic Layer anime vs manga and the Akame ga Kill anime vs manga, compared to the Shomin Sample anime vs manga]), there should be no need to separate the two (i.e., they'll fall under one tag). 

Should there be exceptions?

There may be special circumstances to warrant separation. For an example, Dragonball, Dragonball Z, Dragonball GT, and Dragonball Super can be different enough to warrant separate tags while being all a part of one continuous series with shared characters, compared to Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, which should not. The Fate/Stay Night falls in a similar category, we should refer to the Deen TV anime as separate from the Deen UBW, which is separate from the ufotable remake of UBW and Heaven's Feel. Evangelion should be separated into the TV series, End of Evangelion movie, and the Rebuild movies. This way we can make a distinction and better focus on the topic specifically, rather than generalize them. 

What should we do?

I propose that if we would like split series with different continuities establish an meta where we clarify everything from the guidelines of how to approach tagging to any exceptions to these guidelines, along with an explanation of why decide to do things this way. This would eliminate any confusion on the topic and set a precedence for future series as well.

Less isn't always practical, but consistency and clarity are. While it may require more work (for the mods and community; retagging question, synonymizing,  making better tag excerpts and wikis, etc.) as a whole, I feel that starting to be more consistent with our current site policies can better shape our attitude and outlook on future policies as well.

What exactly are the the standards for asking a question in title and body?

This just came up for me because I wanted to ask a question but had to unnecessarily make my title and body longer because I was shown the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/quality-standards-error"This post does not meet our quality standards."  message.

So it would be nice to see why the title or body doesn't meet the standard and not let the users guess.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Standards for questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have a look at [this Meta post](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/92074/208518) for more guidance. The problems seen most often are with poorly worded titles and capitalisation, and question formatting is also taken into account. Please see http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help and http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-askb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also note that [your question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28056/49) is not unnecessarily long.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course its not long, but the last line is not necessary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is, it provides some context to the users who might want to try to help you. It's important that you give some background, and show some effort in research.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the feature request part, I'll see what can be done about adding a link to the help centre post in the warning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can't tell you why you initial post did not fulfill the quality standards, because we don't know what you posted.

Please include your initial post title and body, andvwe can give you an idea of what's wrong with it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question wasn´t aimed at a specific question, you can however find the link and what i wanted to post in the comments above


















There's no standard per say, but generally questions should be as detailed as you can make them. This is why there are minimum character limits and such. The more detailed the question, the more likely it is that people will be interested enough to answer. One line questions tend to be seen as low effort.
The Title of your question should be a brief summary of the question:

Why does X happen?
If X happened, Why is Y still alive?
What is the first instance of X in an anime?

The Body of your Question should expand on this summary, including any relevant information:

I am somewhat confused by the fight scene between A & B in episode Q at time XXm:XXs.
Character A says "I must destroy you, for you are evil", to which Character B replies "You cannot destroy me, No anime characters can defeat me".
If this is true, how did Character A destroy Character B?

As you can see, this is fairly short - but it includes all the information needed for an answerer to immediately know what you are talking about. Therefore, the only standard we impose on how you form your questions is Quality.
This might seem intimidating to someone who doesn't have English as a first language, but other users will likely edit your spelling mistakes and such if you have put enough effort into your question.
(P.S. The answer is the anime is actually a comic crossover and Character A is actually an american comic character, not an anime character [What a twist!] )

If that is classified thats an answer i can accept.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eumel ah, I understand now. I think there is still value in keeping this answer though, and it looks like Jnat has answered the actual question you wanted answeredb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eumel The Meta post I linked you to on the comment left on the question states "Exact details about the algorithm are not being released by the team." In fact, you should focus on trying to understand what we regard as a good question and aim for that, instead of trying to figure out what is the minimum you can do just to bypass the filter.


















I frequently see unanswered questions, not because there isn't good answers but because the user who asked them is no longer active.

Should these be closed? 
As without an accepted answer they are not very useful. And if they are closed it will give an active user the chance to ask them, without it being a duplicate, and select the answer.

And if so can we have an addition reason for closing implemented such as user inactive or something?

Or should there be functionality implemented to vote on inactive users answers so that people with good answers can get the recognition they deserve?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should be done with inactive users questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So you think it makes sense to close a question as inactive, so that another user may ask the same question again? Why?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So that an answer can be accepted that is correct, otherwise no answer is selected so it may be unclear what the answer is. That was just an example of why it would be useful, but there are other reasons such as no one will receive recognition for there answer, so maybe a feature to vote on an answer for inactive users would be better


















I've appreciated SciFi and Fantasy SE's approach more and more as time goes on. For large franchises like Star Trek and Star Wars, SFF has a single tag for the franchise, and then tags for the specific properties in the franchise. For example, they have a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/star-trekstar-trek tag, and then https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/star-trek-tosstar-trek-tos, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/star-trek-tngstar-trek-tng, and so on. Questions about the franchise in general will be tagged with just the franchise tag. Questions about a specific series will have the franchise tag as well as the tag for the specific series.

So in our case, we would have an https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evangelionevangelion tag and then https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/eva-tveva-tv, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/end-of-evaend-of-eva, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rebuild-of-evarebuild-of-eva. Questions about the franchise as a whole, or which are open to answers drawn from any part of the franchise, can be tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evangelionevangelion. Questions which are additionally focused on a single property would also have a specific tag. E.g. "Why was Asuka designed with red hair?" would be tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evangelionevangelion because Asuka's character design pertains to the entire franchise and not just a specific series. "Why did Asuka say 'Kimochi warui'?" would be tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evangelionevangelion https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/end-of-evaend-of-eva; this way it shows up in searches for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evangelionevangelion questions, but it's also obvious that the question pertains to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/end-of-evaend-of-eva. This also solves the problem of specific tags that only have two or three questions; while there will be such tags (I don't know that we'll have many questions on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/eva-angelic-dayseva-angelic-days, for instance), the questions will be double-tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/evangelionevangelion, so all the Eva questions can be aggregated when necessary.

While I think this would solve our problem, it has two disadvantages. First, it's high maintenance. We would probably need high rep users to buzz around adding and subtracting tags to make sure that every question conforms to the convention. 

Second, we'll have to make up our own names for cases like the 2003 Full Metal Alchemist anime, because the tag would need to be distinct from the main https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/full-metal-alchemistfull-metal-alchemist tag as well as the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-mangafma-manga tag. I don't particularly like ʞɹɐzǝɹ's solution of adding dates and studios (https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-2003fma-2003 or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unlimited-blade-works-deenunlimited-blade-works-deen) as these shows are not commonly known by those titles, which means people will be even more likely to tag incorrectly and make more work for other users. I don't have a better idea, though.

Perhaps we could just take the lazily evaluated approach: make a series tag for everything, but when we see a question that has to specify which series or continuity it's talking about for the question to even be valid or sensible, go in and make a separate tag for that series. (And of course backfill the tags where this has already happened.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would also support judging on a case by case basis whether a work in a series is important and distinct enough to warrant a separate tag. The Dragon Ball Z movies mostly don't impact existing continuity in any way, so they don't really need their own tags. End of Eva hugely impacts existing continuity, so it warrants its own tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I support this approach. It's similar to how SO works with versioning issue (i.e. [java] vs [java-8]) since sometimes the question is specific to that version.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright, lets go with this approach officially! Let's roll it out over the next few days


















I'm not sure where I stand on this, but I don't see why we can't trial it as it shouldn't affect too many questions. 

My only reservation is that these could become hundreds of tags that aren't that useful or questions will be applying a lot of tags needlessly. This also runs somewhat contrary to the 'too localized' rule that is often on SE networks. (We don't necessarily have to take that rule on ourselves though)

I think we should keep an eye out for unnecessary tagging of these on unintended questions.

A Luxembourg tag for exampleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My point is that the notion of "too localized" was (or at least should have been) intended to mean "this question only helps the author and literally nobody else". Questions that are potentially relevant to an entire country's worth of people are not that.

Recently I came across https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/28447/which-episode-is-this-from-c%C2%B3this post, the author was asking from which episode a certain picture/screenshot was. 

I wrongly voted to close this as a duplicate of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618/where-is-this-picture-from-how-do-i-use-reverse-image-search-to-find-the-source"Where is this picture from? How do I use Reverse Image Search to find the source of an anime/manga image?" (as we do with most image only identification requests).

The problem I have with this type of question is that it won't be of much use for anyone but the author.

Should we allow “From which episode is this image?” questions: No, too broad

Should we allow "From which episode is ....?" questions in general: Debatable

"From which episode is this image" questions become too broad fairly easily. Unless a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618/where-is-this-picture-from-how-do-i-use-reverse-image-search-to-find-the-sourcereverse image search quickly manages to exclude the image from being from a specific movie, or visual novel. 

If that is not the case, it would mean that the person answering would need to have a very in-depth knowledge of the source material, which sometimes includes more than thousands of hours of screen time. Or they have to go re-watch/read the whole thing just to get this one answer, which in most cases will not help a lot of people either way. This is based on some of the "from which episode" questions we already have on the site. 

Then should we just disallow "from which episode" questions all together? 

No, I don't think that is a good option. Most image identifications become too broad fairly fast. And even though this can also be the case for a bulk of the other "from which episode" questions out there, they could be borderline answerable. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20602/in-which-episode-does-this-picture-from-the-opening-of-k-on-appearTaking this K-on question and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/15592/in-which-episode-do-they-say-that-from-the-outside-the-straw-hats-dont-look-lithis One Piece question, which are also fairly broad, yet are not bad questions in themselves.

In both cases, I think the questions should at the very least suffice to the 
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892ID-request rules in general, even if the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag may not always apply.

There's already quite a few better examples of questions like this, not to mention good reasons to ask them. And in the first place, "good or ban" is about the worst false dichotomy you can propose on meta. Even the one pointed to in the OP isn't remotely "too broad"; it's completely answerable, in fact in just a couple sentences. Moreover, these aren't ID requests at all; they're in-universe questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@loganm only below average, image related, in which episode questions.

While I'm not a fan of these questions, I think they should be judged on a case-by-case basis.

as @LoganM has pointed out (and @Dimitrimx in his answer) there are instances of good questions that can be asked in this format.

Therefore, I think we should deal with low-quality questions as usual and indicate it with downvotes.

I'm thinking that it might help new comers who don't have enough reputation more options to arrive at a dummy tag, instead of giving up posting the question because the tag for the series they want to ask is not available.

Prompting users to select [retag] (even though, I assume, the guidance would mention that it should only be used when there isn't an available tag for them to use and they can't create a new one) will leave us with a lot more of question with [retag] instead of the few edge cases that would definitely need it, simply because it's the path with the least resistance for a new user who just wants to get their question posted and get answers to it.


















I think what you're trying to solve should be handled a bit differently. If a user doesn't know what to type into tags list, they may type "anime" or "manga" and then a popup would appear explaining how to use tags if one of those blacklisted words is detected.

Currently it's this:



That message is not very helpful at all.

To make it more user-friendly, some solutions would have to be added, like "Add the name of the anime/manga you're asking about". The message itself has to be enough for a new user to know what to do, without resorting to links to relevant meta posts, which are very long and you know it's not a nice solution. But we could think of a good way to solve this.

I guess when the "You gotta add tags" notification shows up, it could also contain help for finding appropriate tags, with "retag" as a last resort, and I'd say it should not be immediately visible, so lazy users would not go straight for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao: I think that's a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao You _can't_ not include any tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @Hakase in that [tag:retag] should _definitely_ not be immediately suggested, as we'll just end up with a ton of questions from new users with that tag and a lot of work on our hands.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat That's the problem: you *can't* not include any tag. We either end up with a ton of questions with the retag or a ton of questions that are inappropriately tagged. The amount of work on our hands doesn't change either way. A warning message should be shown first if posting a question without selecting any tag, but should the user choose to ignore the warning and click the post question button the second time, they should be allowed to do so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao And then have a front page be filled with untagged questions? What's the benefit of that?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like I told y'all [a year ago](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/1139/having-identification-request-and-retag-show-up-as-tag-suggestions-by-defaul/1141#1141), we can change the error shown for the anime tag. Since you haven't done that yet, arguing for some crazy, complicated alternate solution is just a waste of your time, @Gao.


















Shows for which we have tags are struckthrough. Additionally, shows for which we had tags at the beginning of the season are unbolded.

I left out some stuff that pretty much nobody over here is going to watch, like "Ganbare! Lulu Lolo 3", whatever that is.

It appears there's some pressure on users to avoid tips and background information on how they identified an anime within their answer.

I think this stems from earlier answers that berated question askers for not doing an image search or simple google search - such scolding clearly isn't allowed.

However, we've now swung too hard to the other side, and answers which include any explanation as to how they solved the puzzle of figuring out the anime from hints in a question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/28889/need-help-in-identifying-movie-with-a-boy-who-can-turn-into-a-tree-and-a-girl-f#comment40262_28890are being targeted for comments, downvotes, and edits.

Is it, or should it be, policy to force users to strictly limit their answers and include no other explanation or information on how they solved the riddle, based on the question's hints?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should identification answers be strictly minimal?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you basing this post on the sole example you present? 'Cause this is not a trend I am aware of. Most answer just _happen_ to not mention how the user found the answer, but I am not aware of any pressure not to do so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looking at whatever comment that are left on the answer and the vote break down (currently no downvote), I don't understand what is the problem here. I assume there was only one comment about those extra information. As for the edits, the end result looks fine, in my opinion - it's just the style we use here (title on the top as tl;dr, the rest are supporting information).


















It's 2016 now, and we've https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/272563/were-standardizing-the-sidebar-width-at-300px-on-all-sitesmade some changes to the sidebar size. As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!

Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


the site's twitter account
review blogs and research websites to keep on top of each new season
events, meetups, and conventions 
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in 


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2717here.

It had quite a positive response on the meta post then.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Might pick a new face to go with it, as is traditionally my suggestion for each year's swap.


















The meta is written in order to better explain the intent behind the changes to site tags in regards to series continuity as noted in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2673/why-fma-and-fma-brotherhood-didnt-have-different-tag/2714#2714this meta.

This experiment is being done in an attempt to access the viability of such a change on a community-wide basis. If it is deemed that there is little to no improvement in how users interact, understand, and/or use these tags, the described changes will be reverted.

What series will be affected?

The two series franchise have been chosen for this experiment based on prior feedback:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-seriesfma-series including https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-2003fullmetal-alchemist-2003, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-brotherhoodfma-brotherhood
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonball-seriesdragonball-series including https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-zdragon-ball-z, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-gtdragon-ball-gt, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-superdragon-ball-super


Fullmetal Alchemist series questions will require a franchise tag along with a series tag. E.g., https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-seriesfma-serieshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-brotherhoodfma-brotherhood for questions on the Brotherhood anime.

The Dragonball series questions will require only the tag of the series continuity asked.

Because many of our questions have been more related to anime rather than manga, the tags will skew in favor of the anime series naming. That is not to say that questions specifically related to their respective manga will be ignored. Users can still use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-mangadragon-ball-manga for the Dragonball manga series and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-mangafullmetal-alchemist-manga for the Fullmetal Alchemist manga series.


If you were to ask a question about the difference between the FMA: Brotherhood anime and FMA manga, you would use the following tags: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-seriesfma-serieshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-brotherhoodfma-brotherhoodhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-mangafullmetal-alchemist-manga
For question involving the anime series and the respective manga for Dragonball: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-superdragon-ball-superhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-mangadragon-ball-manga
For general franchise related questions, just the franchise tag is needed for either series.


What's being tested?

Two variables will be used for testing here: 


Whether requiring a franchise tag in addition to a series tag referring to the continuity is viable or not (for Fullmetal Alchemist)
Whether just splitting the continuities based on the anime title is enough (For Dragonball)


The control part of the experiment will be all of the current series tags, of which there will not change in any way. 

This experiment will be last for a 1 to 2 month period, starting the Sunday of January 17, 2016, starting at 0 UTC, during which period the community can provide feedback using this meta. If this tag experiment is deemed unviable by a majority of users, then this experiment will conclude prematurely and all changes reverted to how they were prior. If however, there is data and feedback to show that the tag changes are indeed viable (i.e. improves user experience), a second round of discussion will be made in order to discuss community wide rollout.

To make things easier for users to understand, the respective tag wikis for the abovementioned series will include a more indepth explanation of how to use these tags. 

Some points to consider within this experiment are:


Does the added complexity help understanding the question topic, without the need to explain in the question title or body? I.e., know that I'm talking about a specific continuity without explicitly having to say it
Will having less generalized series tags help with organization and searchability? Each question has five slots for tags, which will allow us to test if including more tags will have any added benefit or if they will just clutter up the site
How users react to more drastic changes in tag policy 


It's understandable that this experiment seems a bit forced, but in order to give some sort of resolution to the ongoing back and forth discussion on whether or not more specification and less generalization in terms of story continuity is needed, the idea of field testing the change on a limited scale was made.

Why should you care/participate?

Participation is completely voluntary. Because there has been a lot of back and forth about whether we should do something or how we should act with regards to tagging, I believe that putting these hypotheses to the test and getting actual results might give us a better idea of the direction we should focus on for our site policies. While we can't always see eye to eye on every thing, we should try to give each other a chance to prove themselves to be correct or incorrect through a bit of experimentation.

During this time, all users are encouraged to ask more question relating the the Dragon Ball and Fullmetal Alchemist series.

Any questions, concerns, feedback, or complaints can be addressed in this meta or on our http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-main chatroom.

Is that an acceptable outcome? (Would it make moderation considerably more difficult?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, but it's been discussed that there is reasonable cause to split series tags based on story continuity.

Personally, I'd be comfortable using [tag:fullmetal-alchemist-2003] for the _Conqueror of Shamballa_ film (iirc it falls reasonably into that continuity). However, I'm not sure about _Sacred Star of Milos_. Apparently that's generally not treated as "canon" for the manga / FMA:B, but the story IIRC is based on that continuity. (Currently there are 2-3 questions about the film on the site.)

The only thing I would be careful about is how broad your question is - Does Love Live take place in a vast number of locations? If it's too large, it might be out of scope for an answerer and potentially closed.

Something like "Are the locations where the group played real-life locations" would be a more appropriate question.

However the purpose of why I want to ask the question (and also the reason why I want to make it Community Wiki) is to make it the 'canonical' and one-stop post for Love Live real locations. I was also planning on linking that Q&A to the post I am planning to make.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinoKyouko so I'm guessing that if I posted such a question, it would be closed as too broad?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Keale probably, unless you can reduce itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinoKyouko Thank you for the response. Although Love Live does take place in many locations, the 3 places I'm talking about is only located in one place and the two of them are related. I will just ask something like: `What are the places in Love Live that are located in Akihabara?` or `Where could I find Kanda Myoujin Shrine?`, and let the community sort it out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You may find it appropriate to split them into several questions to cover what you are looking for, specifying a reduced scope for each.

It's that time again, let's look at another aspect of the site that https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2564/lets-take-a-look-back-at-our-site-policies-2015-edition/2672you picked for review. Our continuity tagging experiment is still underway, but this is an item I've wanted to review for a while.
 This time we're looking at https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-requests that are based off of an image search. Here's the gist of the original suggestion:


  Our current id-requirements for an id-request are https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#8923 points of information. Currently, Image-based requests are not being held to that standard. Part of this is because Image id-requests are hard to "provide more information for" if all the user has is a single image.


We need to standardize how these are asked.


  
  What additional items could users provide?
  Do we need to rethink our rules for this type of questions?
  What counts as extra information? What if I post multiple frames of a .gif / several scenes?
  Which comes first? Closing as reverse-searchable or as too-little-detail?
  


How should we deal with these questions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Policy Review: Image-only id requestsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Image only ID should be straight closed, we do similar with them over Movies.se.


















Rather than attempt a roundabout way to tackle this problem that will make our rules more complex and that we will inevitably come back to re-assess, I think the source of the problem with these questions is clear:

Questions with only one image are not good questions.

Regardless of information of whether the user reverse-searched it, where they found it, etc - it still boils down to one piece of information that an answer has to work off of. 

That is why I would like to limit these questions to a specific subset. (Feel free to suggest additions in the comments):


Merchandise
Cosplay from a convention you attended


My rationale for these exemptions is that they provide more information for our answerers - With merchandise, the user can provide any  angles requested, any markings on the items, place of purchase, etc. Cosplay can also aid identification through offical convention media such as facebook groups, titled photo galleries & cosplayers often advertise their personal pages. Note that this does not include random cosplays from the internet (although perhaps this rule could be relaxed based on feedback from the rest of the users here).

I think I share the same sentiment as many other users in that it feels like we are treated as an alternative reverse search engine.  And new users will treat us as such when they see these types of question on the homepage, usually a high percentage of it - If you watch Joel's talk on https://vimeo.com/54912932Cultural Anthropology , you'll see that these questions signal to our users what we are about and if they want to join our community. So it's no real surprise that we're being treated as a community for identifying random anime-looking pictures on the internet if the front page is filled with questions that are single images with "what is this anime".

This will also solve another issue which I think is silly: The reverse-search duplicate closure reason. These questions are most definitely under-specified so they should have been closed as "too little detail" anyway. The introduction of the closure means that all reviewers have to check if they can find the image on reverse search engines wasting 4 people's time. 

TL;DR:
We are not a search engine. Let's stop accepting those particular questions and focus on more interesting and relevant ones.

Even if  you don't read the rest of the question - just ask yourself why we should accept this terrible standard:

Sure, some of them have nice pictures, but we can just get that from our lovely bot in chat - or, you know, Tumblr.

Soapbox aside, I am sympathetic to people who come here wanting merchandise identified: having a concrete physical entity you own identified is actually valuable in a way that most id-reqs aren't. "What is this thing I own" is a question worth answering, whereas "what is this thing I remember" is rather less so. Cosplay falls into the latter class, imo (unless you own the costume or something, I guess), but I don't feel terribly strongly either way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin I think the main problem with them is there's no clear quality control, whereas at least we have the 3 points for other questions. Cosplay is indeed a less justifiable case, but we can assess this if it gets bad. I believe there won't be too many of themb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To @Memor-X's point, I think we should tag cosplay/merchandise image questions as just "cosplay" or just "merchandise". Then we have a clear policy: there are no identification requests on images. At all. There are just merchandise questions and cosplay questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the end, it has come to this. I don't have any objection, though, since allowing them requires consistent effort from the community to do the up-keeping work. +1b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do [itasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itasha) id-reqs count as cosplay?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ I would think that would fall under the same rules - if you take the photos yourself / it is part of a larger anime event, it could be okay - but if it's just another picture on the internet, I'd be inclined to have it under the removalsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem I find is that there is a disconnect between something you took yourself vs something someone else took. The disconnect where to draw the line. If you say a photo that someone else took and posted on their blog, it would be considered "another picture on the internet." Sometimes the photographer makes a mention, but usually they don't (i.e. because they don't know themselves). It might be worth discussing whether or not we should have them provide a link or mention a source it's not their own.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's also worth mentioning that we should still allow these questions to be asked in our main chat. Given that there is a 20 rep limit to do so, users that have gotten this far have showed that they've at least made some effort to familiarize themselves with our site and should be provided this courtesy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem with our current policy is that it's highly complex, full of grey areas, and forces people to waste time checking sources before they can even know if the question is on-topic. If we start making exemptions and adding conditions, we're going to end up with another highly complex policy full of grey areas and loopholes. If accepting cosplay and itasha is going to drive us into another maze of loopholes, I think we should not accept them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the most practical course is to outlaw all photo-based identification requests which fall outside the bounds of merchandise and cosplay, and decide the edge cases when they show up, instead of trying to cast our minds ahead to come up with them and predetermine our policy to deal with them. I suppose itasha are either merchandise or cosplay, depending on how you look at it, so they can be allowed in general.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda That's a good suggestion :)


















I've managed to get more reputation here than almost any other Stack Exchange, but I still have a hard time think of any kind of question that would be a good fit.

I like the idea of an anime stack exchange, but most of the questions I would want to ask are discussion or opinion based, not objective.  I see a lot of on hold topics, and in reading some other meta posts, I see that list topics and recommendations seem to have gone away, with the example questions deleted.

So... I'm a member of this Stack Exchange thinking "What can I do with it?"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Discussions are not welcome on the main part of the site. There's a [special place for that called chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-). Jump in and let's discuss some possibilities.


















So you probably know about those Identification Request type of questions, most probably from them swamping the front page pretty often. Let's talk about where they are now and where they may better belong.

A while ago the main site classified such questions as off-topic until one day we decided to allow them for reasons of goodwill. It's great to help others discover new things and remember old ones. Everybody feels good about doing that.

But what's not good is that those types of questions are usually of very low quality level, compared to all the other, "main" types of questions before ID requests. They bring down overall question quality and flood "recently active questions" tabs/views.

Also, they are not useful to a lot of viewers. Honestly, have you yourself read a lot of those? Is it that much better than just asking for recommendations in chat? How do you think the "satisfied customer count" differs between an average ID question and an average in-universe rule explanation?

Rules don't apply to IDs the same way they do to regular questions. There is a whole other ruleset to govern IDs now, which makes it apparent that they themselves are a whole different type of question (and this is why I'm talking about IDs and "main" questions separately).

Most users that come by to ask ID questions, disappear forever. Very few edit after getting closed, and very few stick around. Talk about time well spent.

I'm not saying IDs are bad and we should ban them. I'm saying maybe both IDs and the "main" content would be better off if they were separated from each other.

One idea that I've had for a while is to put them all into a separate tab called "ID requests". That would clear up all the "main" site views from them, and it would serve as an "exploration" view for some connoisseurs (personally, I don't think that's a viable exploration method).

Another idea is to completely move them from the main site to chat. That would also automatically mean 20 rep minimum requirement, and I see how a lot of the ID answerers wouldn't agree with this, as it basically doesn't allow 99% of newcomers to ask anything, while your goal is to help everyone in need. It's just one of the ideas. One important note: in chat, it's gonna be hard to track down all posts related to one ID request. So perhaps one "place" per ID is better.

Lastly, how about just moving this whole ID thing to a separate site from StackExchange and offer help there? Perhaps to one of the Anime&Manga social network pages? It would still be affiliated with SE but not clutter up the site, and anyone can post with a social network account.

How does all of that sound?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's talk about the place of ID requests on our siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While being quite new on this SE, I do agree that ID-req should be placed apart. Even though the "chat" solution does not guarantee an unicity, does any "1 rep guy" check for existing answer before posting in the current system?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You could find out the real numbers by searching for all duplicate IDs. I wouldn't expect anyone to find a dupe of an image-only ID with little or no text.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe the time has come to disallow ID requests? Or maybe we should add asking ID request(or tagging one as such) as a privilege?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Keale we've discussed this a lot in chat before and the general impression is that it would be very hard to govern who's allowed and who's not. Basically if you only allow users with 200 rep to use [ID] tag, and they only have 123 rep, they could easily type a [1D] or something to circumvent the restriction, and it would be a nightmare to enforce.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we decide to remove them we need to have a good idea of how we're going to remove them. Are we going to restrict the topics (e.g., cosplay and merchandise only)? Are we going to blacklist the tag and remove all prior id-requests? Are we going to lock all id request posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ: Insta-close all new id-request, and close all past id-request after 6 months. Black list the tag without removing it (which means the tag stays, but new user can't create new question with the tag). On second though, we may need to edit those posts, so black listing will cause a dilemma for the editors.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhahtdh what about merchandise and cosplay IDs? Are we going to gloss over those? Or move them to their respectively named tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ: I foresee the same problem with cosplay id, but merchandise id seem to be fine (with the exception of the cel sheet incident, but I guess it can be taken care of on case-to-case basis). We probably will move them to a new tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Close + historical lock for all extant ones seems like the easiest way to do this (granted, it's a fair bit of work for you three diamonds, but it's not like it all needs to be done in one fell swoop). Dunno the exact mechanics of blacklisting, but if that's not feasible, closing and deleting any new id-reqs that come in seems not too difficult to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin: I don't think we should lock them. Closing those questions is enough. Blacklisting means that we request SE to prevent some tags from being used in a question, which means that when you submit a new question or edit something, the tag must not be there, but the tag is allowed to stay on existing question. It can be requested, since it's being used on SO. It will automatically prevent new id-req questions, but it also prevent people from cleaning up the question (unless they remove the id-req tag). That's why I had my second thought.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If ID Requests were removed from the website what would happen to the existing questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X Lock up all of them, lock the tag, throw away the keys. Maybe delete the un-answered ones. But we blow it, do a power walk and never look back. After all, [cool guys....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe assign an ID response team, have a pizza prize bounty for whoever clears the most ID questions per month?  Or print a book of the most odd and inane ID requests?  I mean, just like those "people of walmart" books, some of what people submit must be worth putting into a coffee table book.  Dumb stuff people do isn't always bad, just most of the time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sure there can be a place for such an activity, just not here.


















IDs on a separate tab: not going to happen unless SE decides to implement this just for us.

Move IDs to chat: keep them on the main chat room, like on Arqade. There is no need to track down all posts related to IDs. Just ask, and if no one answers, tough luck. Maybe ask again later, or don't bother. We have already written https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21618/8486Where is this picture from? How do I use Reverse Image Search to find the source of an anime/manga image? and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2293/8486An arsenal of tools and know-hows for tackling identification request questions, read them and try those tools/techniques.

Move IDs to a site separate from SE: I don't know, since I probably won't be visiting said site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I haven't been looking at IDs for a long time now even while they're still on the main site. I think we need to ask the users who do look at them if they would still look on another site.

The battle of id requests begins anew.

There are very strong opinions on this topic, which I hope people can restrain in this thread.

Ignoring the question of if do these questions belong here, let me comment on your ideas instead.


New Main Section: The first thing that sticks out to me is (As @Gao mentioned), It's unlikely that SE will devote some engineering time to this. So I think that option is out.
Moving to chat: We allow recommendation questions on chat, not the main site, so does that 20 rep matter?
Moving to chat: Id requests sometimes need time to identify - apart from the low-effort questions, there's usually some research / specific knowledge needed. In a chat based enviroment, I forsee they would get only a few moments of attention and then dismissed.
A new SE site: This would presumably work similar to Code Review SE. I don't think the subset of users interested enough to monitor 2 sites is significant enough to make a new site.
A new social site: From what I've seen (I don't control the social sites), the interaction with them is pretty low from the userbase.
A new separate site: Why not just give the work to an existing site?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Robert Cartaino seemed markedly unhappy with the "new SE site" solution when I brought it up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be honest, I think if we are moving id-requests away, they should just be removed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also to clarify, I am neither for nor against Id requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be sure, a new site would be weird, a probable mishmash of people looking for one-time Fox Kids anime, obscure 1980s movies, old science fiction stories, and Commodore 64 games (since I can't see getting a whole site just for anime identification, and I bet Movies and TV, SF&F, and Arqade would love the chance to be able to escape off their own id request nightmares), and the users who know how to identify them. On the other hand, Software Reqs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can't just dump stuff on another site, we should at least ask other sites if we can refer these questions to them. I don't want any SE site to be flooded with LQ id-reqs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ a new area51 site presumablyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was imagining a new area 51 site, something like "Media Identification Stack Exchange" that we could all dump our id reqs to. I don't think that's a good solution, I was just pointing out that there are weird edge cases like Software Reqs where a topic that seems unsuited to SE gets a site.


















I am for the separate tab idea. However, despite what everyone else is saying, there is an existing functionality on Stack Exchange which can be used for this purpose, given some more tweaking by SE Programmers (which I think will be less work adapting this functionality than building new functionality).

Currently on Stack Overflow, you can create tabs which you can specify tags, and the results are questions which contain those tags.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/AG54w.png

This only exists on Stack Overflow for now, so I suggest that Anime.SE, Gaming.SE, Scifi.SE, Movies.SE and any other entertainment SE site that may be created in the future have an automatically created tab for ID requests, where the tags specified for this tab is set up by the Community Moderators of the site, to account for the different tagging schema used across these sites.


  But what about the other tabs which will still show https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request?


Like the above, there exists functionality for this:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/jm8n8.png

To adapt this, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag in this new tab would be automatically added to the Ignored Tags for new users and guests, so if registered users want to see these questions again, they can remove the tabs from this section in their profile.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While this approach may be useful to existing users which know a bit about how to customize their views, any unregistered (and probably most) viewers would still see the front page as festering with IDs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase you didn't read the second part about the tags the mod select for this id request tab being *"automatically added to the Ignored Tags for new users and guests"*. ofcause incase if it wasn't obvious the hide questions option would also be used rather than the grey out optionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I misunderstood. Well, this is rather hacky. I don't think SE would ever employ such a workaround, they'd rather just make a clean feature from scratch, but that's also a fat chance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Delegating the less desireable question by no means helps resolve it, it just delays the inevitable. Someone still needs to wade through these question and prune out the bad ones. Since SE is moderated by the community, it's up to everyone to pitch in. However not everyone wants to deal with those questions. Bad questions will continue to pile up, attracting bad answer and ire. This tab would eventually be regarded as the rubbish bin of the site discouraging many to go there because they know how bad the questions maybe.


















So I've been lurking from the shadows on this one, watching the number of identification requests steadily increase, and I've been thinking to myself...

This can't go on.  This isn't how I wanted to contribute; by identifying series.

The thing is, if we want to support this, the only ideal place for it is chat.  Why?


A separate tab sends the message that it's okay to ignore these types of questions, and it's guaranteed that this tab will not get the same amount of traffic to it.
A different site all but dooms these sorts of requests, and there's no real Q&A value to be had out of them (at least, in my mind).


Chat has its pros in that:


Users are forced to have some modicum of participation on the site overall before they can ask an ID request
There are users that are willing to help with ID requests in chat
Questions with ID attempts are off the main site


For what it's worth, my vote is chat.  That is, if the community-at-large wants to support such things in chat.  It at least sounds like that's the direction we're going, but I don't want to burden them with something they may not really want.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Chat is a terrible place to do id-req. I wouldn't readily invite people to join chat to post their requests. Sure, they can ask, but whether people want to answer or not is a different issue. And there is the same issue like the main site, with the amount of details in the description. In contrast, recommendation is fine, since everyone has their favorites or recently read/watched series that they can shareb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm comfortable with that sentiment.  I only agreed with chat since it seemed like a lot of the others felt the same way, but if that's not something that chat wants to support, then we shouldn't make them support it.


















I'm not an active user on this site, and I don't have a particularly large interest in anime. However, I'm here for a simple reason. I'm a power user over at the Movies & TV Stack Exchange, where we have struggled with this problem for years and someone happened to highlight this discussion to me. There are a plethora of questions on our Meta discussing our identify problems, https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2128/8219but I can refer you to something I wrote quite recently, which is a very detailed analysis of the questions asked on our site over the last five years.

In short, retention rates of identify-askers is pretty terrible (just 25% of askers have 125 rep or more, compared to 75% of non-identify askers) and the quality of questions is generally very poor (with substantial editing and modding needed for each one to make them legible). We've added in pop-ups and more information to assist users posting these questions, and largely they're ignored. We even put in a link to an external website which is a specialist place for these questions, and all it appears to have done is increase traffic to our site for these questions.

In short, 30% of all our questions are identify this, from 2011 (which was when we opened). However, that's all time. In the last two years, they've averaged 36% of questions on the site and they're continuing to grow.

If you take a look at our https://movies.stackexchange.com/Movies & TV home page you'll hopefully see some wonderful, in-depth questions and analysis. But sadly, there's also a clutter of identify-this questions, most of which are looked at once by the OP and forgotten about. It's not clear they have any value to users down the line which is one of the fundamental purposes of any Stack site.

I don't believe chat would be a good place for these questions either, and new users wouldn't know to post them there.

Therefore, I'd strongly urge removing them from your site, so you don't have the issues we have on our own beloved site. The problem (and volume of them) will get worse, and sadly it will make the home page, for any new users, look like a random trivia dump, as opposed to a detailed, in-depth question and answers page.

As can be seen from our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2725/policy-review-image-only-id-requestsprevious meta, there is a clear community concensus that image id-requests don't have a place on our site.

As such, we will begin phasing out these questions. The first thing to do (for the moderators) is update the rules to reflect this change. This will start to happen a small while after this post.

Effects of this change:


This closure will affect any tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-questionsidentification-questions that are solely based on a single image with no additional sources of information.
Image-based Merchandise questions should now use the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise tag and not use the identification-request tag. Similarly, Cosplay based questions should use the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosplaycosplay tag.


  Note that these execeptions will need to comply with general identification standards of providing additional information - such as venue, place of purchase, markings, et cetera.



As users, we would like your assistance in cleaning up the existing posts as there are a lot of posts to go through. Please close any appropriate posts as "Too little detail" and they will be added to the review queue. This closure reason will be edited to reflect our new stance.

Because there are so many of these questions, this is potentially a good time to score some nice review-based badges ;)

For new questions / confused users, please direct them towards the original meta post to show them that these questions are no longer allowed.

Finally, we realise identification-requests as a whole are a large elephant in the room - we will revisit the overarching issue after resolving these instances and seeing how they affect the overall quality and also the community's opinion.

Keep up the good work everyone,

I have created a query to help everyone with their cleanup.

http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/edit/433431http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/edit/433431

It basically looks for identification requests that have an image and are under a certain length.

Based on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/29534/are-there-censored-or-discarded-pokemon-creatures-and-what-are-the-motives-behinmy question about censorship in Pokemon, I'm thinking in if I can post another question asking basically the same, but with another anime i.e. Yu-Gi-Oh!


    I'm really a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh! since its beginning, but, I avoided ask about Yu-Gi-Oh! censorship because I did think that Anime & Manga community would not take it serious (I was a little paranoic on that I must confess maybe for The Abridged Series episodes...)


But, I really don't know if that behavior would be considered as abuse or discouraged or duplicate questions therefore, may bring downvotes or would be closed; so, I'm wondering.


Should and can I make sepatared questions about censhorship with different anime and manga creations?
Should or must I edit my current question for make it more comprehensive i.e where the accepted answer should be the one which provides more info in different anime and manga creations?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Change the question to include more viewpoints from other anime and manga productionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I actually think this question is more interesting about Yugioh than about Pokemon, since Yugioh was aimed at an older audience and had human-looking monstersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda, I'll post the question about Yu-Gi-Oh! then :) Thanks _(or if someone will do it first, I wont see problems with that)_.


















I've noticed a few people still answering image-only id requests, or closing them as duplicates of the "how to reverse image search" question. Please don't answer them.
Let me repeat that in really big letters.
Please don't answer image-only id requests
Answering them will encourage more of them. Even if they're technically off-topic, people who want to ask them will see that they can get answers before they're closed, and keep asking them. We know the people who ask these questions don't care about question quality and don't intend to become regular users of the site, so they don't care if they burn bridges by sneaking in off-topic questions under the fence, as long as they get their answer. Don't give it to them.
I would encourage everyone not to answer in comments either. If you want to help the OP, give them a link to the "how to reverse image search" question and another one to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2725/7579Policy Review: Image-only id requests, and let them know that image-only ID requests are now off-topic. If you know of another site where image id requests are okay, you can point them there. If the OP has 20 rep, you can send them to chat. Then help this site, and vote to close as "Too little detail to be answered."
Okay? :)
Otherwise, good job so far, everyone! I burned through all my close votes three days in a row, and I know lots of other people have as well. I even had the honor to kill my own image question. I just went through a review queue with 36 crappy image id requests up for closure. That's the most full I've ever seen a review queue on Anime and Manga. We're making progress.

Do not copy text verbatim from Wikipedia or elsewhere into tag wikis and excerpts. Not even if you do so in a license-compliant way. Here is why:


Any idiot can type the name of an anime or whatever into Google or Wikipedia and find exactly the same thing.
See #1.


If you are in the suggested edits queue, you should know that there is a special rejection reason exclusively for edits to tag wikis: 


  This edit copies a significant amount of content from an external source. Generic descriptions such as encyclopedia articles and ad copy do not provide useful guidance; try creating something http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/useful to this community specifically, and be sure to attribute the original author. See: https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/referencingHow to reference material written by others.


Please use this rejection reason liberally. Here's a protip to get you started: if you see Japanese characters, there's a 99% chance it's copied from Wikipedia. Frankly, if you see anybody editing a tag wiki (not an excerpt; an actual wiki body) at all, it behooves you to google the first sentence and see if it shows up on Wikipedia or MAL. Odds are, it will.

(What prompted this? Well, someone just went through and made a buttload of bad suggested edits to various tag wikis, and most of them got approved.)

The problem is people just copy the plot descriptions and stuffs directly from Wikipedia.

Series Tags

Section 1 - Intro and Excerpt

The first section, generally 1 paragraph long, should contain the name of the series with any abbreviated name that's commonly used along with the original author. Other things that can also be added are the genre/demographic of the series (shounen, shoujo, mystery, shoujo ai) and the kanji/kana

Examples

Puella Magi Madoka Magica


  Puella Magi Madoka Magica (also 魔法少女まどか☆マギカ, Mahō Shōjo Madoka Magika) is an original anime from 2011 of the magical girl genre by animation studio SHAFT, directed by Shinbo Akiyuki and written by Urobuchi Gen. It is well known for its dark themes and references, unlike most traditional magical girl shows.

This section can also be used for the tag excerpt however it's also handy (but not required) to add an extra line describing the story or if it received any adaptions

Section 2 - Story

This section includes a brief of the story or the setting of the series. these can be a couple of paragraphs long however try and summarize it to about 2 paragraphs.

For series with a number of different and separate plots like with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/atelieratelier or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pretty-curepretty-cure it's best to describe how the different titles are connected.

Examples

Maria-sama ga Miteru


  The story is about a group of teenage girls attending the Catholic Lillian Girls' Academy in Tokyo, Japan, and focuses on the lives and close relationships of the school's student council, known as the Yamayuri Council. It is broken up into 3 families, Chinensis (Red Rose), Gigantea (Yellow Rose) and Foetida (White Rose), each headed by a senior Lady Rose (or Rosa). A Rosa has a junior student as their younger sister or petite sœur called an en bouton who in turn may have a younger sister of their own known as an en bouton petite sœur.
  
  Often the story is focused on the developing relationship of the Chinensis Family couple Sachiko Ogasawara and her en bouton (en bouton petite sœur in Season 1) Yumi Fukuzawa.


Sono Hanabira


  The series follows the the developing relationships of the featured couples, with each game usually focusing on one couple. The series centers around 2 locations:

  Saint Michael’s General Hospital (in Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o - Tenshi)
  


Pretty Cure


  The "Pretty Cures" are girls who can transform into magical girls with several different origins depending on the series.


Section 3 - Release Information

This Section includes where a series has been release in what forms, this includes:


What magazine it may have been serialized
When it was adapted into another format (Light Novel => Manga, Manga =-> Anime, etc)
What other spinoffs there are and their titles
When which distributors (Funimation, Aniplex, Madman) got the license to distribute the media


dot points 1 and 2 generally can be merged into one paragraph while dot points 3 and 4 can be their own. 

Dot point 3 can also be separated into separate paragraphs if the series contains sub series which can be considered different but do not have their own series tag. if a sub series does have it's own series tag then an extra line to mention this should also be included

Examples

Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha


  The series has 3 anime seasons, namely Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha, Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's, and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS, as well as movies Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's.

"Don't Tell Mother Maria") is a series of small humourous "outtakes" in a "chibi" style that often inflates key character traits such as Kanako's size or Sei's teasing of Yumi.


Monogatari Series


  The light novels recieved a number of anime adaptations. 
  
  
  The first one, based on the Bakemonogatari novel and animated by the studio Shaft, aired in summer 2009 and had 12 episodes followed by 3 bonus episodes.

  Other media includes a drama CD, released on August 3, 2009; a PlayStation Portable visual novel titled Bakemonogatari Portable that was released on August 23, 2012; and a number of nendoroid figures.


Section 4 - See Also

This is where you can list links which have more infromation and generally where you got the information for the above, places you can use may include


Wikipedia
My Anime List
Anime News Network
Visual Novel Database (for Visual Novels)
Wikia's (like Type-Moon, Nanoha, Sword Art Online etc.)


For series like Pretty Cure or xxxHolic sites like Anime News Network will normally list all related series so you only really need to include one link rather than every subseries

Extra - Image

alot of series tags contain an image (or sometime 2) at the top of the tag wiki. there is no rule to what kind of image so long as it follows the Content Policy of Stack Exchange and it is not fan art.

An easy way to find an image is to look for Book/Disk Case Covers or use the feature image found in the list above

Tips


you can copy stuff from Wikipedia and other sites like the format for the first paragraph however try and rephrase it in your own way.
if you find you need to use > to quote a website then you probably need to work on the quote more to make it a bit more original

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also like to put a 1-phrase resume in the excerpt.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, like, you can do all these things if you really want to, I guess, but I'm pretty sure that people almost never read the wikis for series tags. Your effort would probably be better spent elsewhere. Also, please refrain from adding kana/kanji to excerpts. Space is limited for excerpts, and Japanese text tends to take up a lot of space, while providing no real benefit.


















Is there a meta Question and answers regarding the topic about bans?

For example if a user is banned from doing something such as a privilege in this site.
Also like what he/he is prevented from doing, or how many days, months, years this is effective?
If a new User or an Unexperienced user does something that banned his/her account but can still login to the site, where could he/she find the explanation as to what happened and to also notify him/her of what NOT to do next time.

I've been searching the meta about ban, user ban, etc. Is it SE wide? or the rules here on Anime.SE different?

Thank You for answering. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a meta post here on Anime.SE that explains user bans?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From what I've seen, you've made a bunch of tag wiki/excerpt edit suggestions which have been many times rejected, showing that most of the time you don't know what you're doing with that privilege. One option to avoid such a situation is to consult with other users in [our chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-) about the edits you want to propose, before actually proposing them. This can help prevent rejected edits and wasted review time for others.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The [help center](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/search?q=ban) may help you !b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Sorry I should have asked someone before making the edits on tag wiki's.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for tag wiki, don't populate it by copying content from elsewhere.

That is how I approached several tag wikis I did, and if my memory serves, none have been rejected.


















Proposition

Let's upgrade the minimal requirements of an ID request to add a list of at least 3 wrong titles and 1 search query. Without this list, the post would be closed for not showing enough effort on the poster's part.

Goals


Explain how users can search on their own, solving and preventing ID questions from being asked;
Improve the quality of IDs that have been asked;
Create more clear-cut rules for closing bad IDs. This will also reduce zombie ID count because of automatic deletion after 30 days.


I think we're having a problem where the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892[closed] notification doesn't explain how to fix a bad ID in a concrete, short and easily understandable way. It looks more like a bunch of guidelines (that's what it's actually called in the close plaque, btw), tips and tricks and general recommendations. And the reviewers basically have to use common sense to arbitrarily evaluate an ID's quality. That does not sound like good rules to me.

Instead of what we have now, I suggest we make my proposed rules the first thing we show to the users whose ID got closed, and then, as an addition, the guidelines as a self-help message.

How it works

The list of course can't be just Naruto, Bleach and Evangelion. It has to be relevant to the search query and the post's body.


  Example: Anime about police who kill people who haven't done anything bad yet
  
  I'm looking for this anime where police aims their pistols at people and the pistol tells them if it will kill the target or just neutralize. Sometimes the pistol doesn't shoot at all.
  
  I have looked for https://www.google.com/search?q=anime+pistol+police"anime pistol police" and found out that it's not:
  
  
  Patlabor
  Dominion tank police
  A. D. Police
  Hellsing
  Psycho-Pass… − and the ID never got posted
  


These days ID requests are so lazy that you can find the answer by googling a few of the keywords in the question. What does that say about the poster? That they most likely didn't try googling. That is too lazy and should not be allowed.

If you see a list of wrong titles in an ID request, it becomes obvious that OP has made at least some effort. Of course if they meet just the minimum requirement, it makes them look bad, but still better than no effort at all.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ID requests: Raising the bar − Proposition to require a list of wrong titlesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5in addition or instead of, our current rules?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is very simple to do and should be set as absolute minimum requirement. Other rules are more like guidelines, and don't provide this level of quality control.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds like a reasonable proposal to me.


















When I first read the post, I was opposed to this, but as I thought about it more, it started to make sense to me. I still think banning id requests is the best way to go. I've never actually seen a "good" id request. The "best" ones are minimally acceptable questions. I can only imagine we still have them around out of a spirit of charity and goodwill, since almost no one thinks they're good questions and the numbers show they don't generally attract people who contribute positively to the site. But if everyone insists on keeping them, I think this is a good addition to our policy.
Here's what I like about this policy: the onus is on the questioner. All reviewers have to do is leave a comment with a link to the requirements, and vote to close. The questioner has to go out and do the work of searching Google and finding three shows that aren't the one they're looking for. This is in contrast to our former policy on image id requests, where reviewers had to prove that the question wasn't easily solvable by reverse image search. That policy was complex and made more work for reviewers because they had to go out and try to find the stupid picture, fail, then come back and fight with close voters to keep the question open. With this policy, reviewers can immediately see that a question fails the requirements, and they can vote to close.
I also like that this policy is very concrete in its requirements. It has obvious, actionable steps. Our other id request guidelines are vague, and it's too easy for people to go "Oh well, that's all I remember" and decide to ignore them because hey, you don't remember what you don't remember. There's no excuse for not doing a Google search on some of the keywords from your question, other than ignorance, which we will remedy.
Here's a problem I see with this policy: there are people on the site who don't care how bad the id requests are, they're still going to answer them. We've seen this with our cleanup of image-only id requests, and I've also seen it going on with regular id requests. It's going to totally undermine us if we have a policy of closing any id request that doesn't have a Google search with three failures, but half the questions that don't have those things get answers anyway because someone who doesn't know the policy or doesn't care sneaks in under the radar and answers it. Bans are useless against hit-and-run questioners, and we know most id requesters are hit-and-run.
Here's another problem I see with this policy: people are lazy, and a shocking number of them suck at using Google. So we're still going to be opening ourselves up to stuff like this:

hai im looking for htis asdjime where peepz ahd liek special powurz and stuffs...i did a google srecha for "anime liek speciall powerza1 and it sed one piece nruto fma but none of this is it cn u help ?? btw ther wher these drgon ballz in the sohw dunno if tht helpz?

Then we have to argue about whether the question deserves to remain open because they did, despite their total ineptitude, have a Google search with three shows in it. While we're arguing, someone else is going to show up and say "It's Dragon Ball Z" and the question will get answered anyway (see problem 1). Then people will keep coming and posting their lazy id requests with awful Google searches that turn up three obvious failures, because they've seen that other people get answers doing it.
However, overall, I have to say this is an improvement over the current situation. It has some hope of raising question quality, and it at least makes things easier on reviewers trying to decide if a question should remain open.

[1]: I actually did do a Google search on "anime liek speciall powerza", and Google knew what I meant. Google is amazing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Answers are not the problem at all in the big picture of our ID service. I'm not a fan of disallowing answers to bad IDs, but the [closed] notification is undeniably the best tool to make posters improve their ID. I think it's completely okay if somebody posts an answer or a comment even if the ID itself is bad. After all, this is a goodwill thing. But if the question doesn't get fixed and it's something trivial like DBZ, it usually gets deleted anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5with your example question i'd be more than happy to close it as unclear what is being asked because that is very hard to readb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase The problem is that if questions that don't follow our guidelines still get answers, our guidelines become meaningless. Suppose I show up and ask a lazy id request without a Google search. Some users comment and tell me I need a Google search. Then someone else answers my question. I've got my answer; I'm not going to bother improving my question. At this point I don't care if it gets closed. Other people come along, see my closed, answered question, and ask their own, figuring they'll get answers before it gets closed too. The site still ends up full of low-quality id requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont'd) If the point of this policy is just to help get id requests answered, then I guess the situation I described is not a problem. If the point is to hold down their overwhelming awfulness, then it is. Granted, it's not just a problem with this specific policy, but with anything we do to try and improve the quality of id requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X Sure, my example question was an exaggeration. But suppose someone had come along and edited to make it easier to read. It's still a bad question because the Google search they did was completely inept. But I foresee a certain number of users saying "Well, it obeys the guidelines, so it should stay open", which also happened with image-only id requests. The site still ends up full of low-quality id requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However, I still support the policy because it seems reasonable and pretty low-effort for reviewers. I was just pointing out some problems I expect to see when we implement it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion, ID requests below certain score (probably <0) that don't seem to have enough quality should be deleted after a week.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase That would certainly help with the problems I brought up, and seems reasonable given how bad id requests have gotten lately.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just looked up how [automatic deletion](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221/how-does-deleting-work-what-can-cause-a-post-to-be-deleted-and-what-does-that) works, turns out bad posts usually get deleted in 9 or 30 days, so there may be no need for forcing manual deletion. Unless it's really bad, then it will probably get manually deleted without having to draw additional attention.


















This is more of a question than a yes/no:

At least 3 wrong titles and 1 search query.

How will this deal with low users with really dumb questions like

It's an anime about super powers
It's not Dragonball, One Piece, Naruto
I tried Google "anime super power"

or even worse:

An anime about girls having fun

it's not naruto, pokemon, digimon
I searched "girl anime" no results


Users never cease to surprise me with the ability to ask questions of impossibly low quality

Like at least similar art or scenery shots. Maybe characters whose designs remind of the searched work. If they can't find at least that, then it means they don't even remember enough to ask a proper question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In case somebody tries to be smart with the bare minimum, I would still close their question until it doesn't look like a riddle. Maybe link some exemplary IDs to show what we want to see. But really, if it looks like your example, it should be closed instantly as "are you kidding me".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think we can do anything to stop cases like this. Some people are just determined to suck, and as long as we allow id requests we can't stop it. The main value I see in this policy is that it gives concrete, somewhat more objective criteria for when to close an id request, criteria that can be applied to all id questions and don't depend at all on the asker's memory.


















The current https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2504/2604prompt given when identification requests are asked is:

Please read our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/892/2604guidelines for identification request questions to make sure you've included sufficient detail.
If you're looking to identify an image, try doing a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618/how-can-i-identify-the-source-of-an-image-using-reverse-image-searchreverse image search before asking.

Now that we've banned solely image-based identification requests, should we revise this prompt? In particular, a casual user might take this to imply that image identification is acceptable, particularly if she doesn't carefully read the guidelines in the link. (The specific answer linked doesn't make mention of the ban of image-only identification; it's a different answer to that question that does so.)

Perhaps something like "make sure the type of question you are about to ask is acceptable for our site"?


















When should I vote up?

Whenever you encounter a question, answer or comment that you feel is
especially useful, vote it up!

Whenever I see any question which I saw very useful, then for sure it makes me click on that upvote icon. But whenever it comes to questions related to identification request then it makes me puzzle. There are few questions which got really high upvote and it makes me think that on what basis they get upvote on that question. I thought they did that because they are also seeking the same question or they are interested in knowing the answer.
For example this: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/30067/nostalgia-hit-me-but-what-anime-is-thisNostalgia Hit Me - But What Anime Is This That Takes Place In An Alternate World That Is Mostly Deserts?
It has only 7 views at that time it got up to 4 upvote which is seriously huge for the identification tag.
So I would like to know that when we have to make an upvote on those question which is based on identification request.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On what basis should I upvote identification requests?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it's a detailed, well-formatted post that looks like the poster has done research and really tried to do their best, upvote. If it looks like the poster was lazy and didn't try much to make their question answerable, downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also we're phasing out image-only ID requests, so I suppose voting on them should not be necessary, as they are quickly closed with a link to our new policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I never upvote them anymore. I downvote particularly bad ones and ignore the less bad ones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I totally agree what Hakase said. But never upvote them is bad. I mean this Anime & Manga site is still developing and if we will not support or encourage others then it will be bad for this site. I raised this question because there are so many questions related to identification tag and many people are involved in this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to upvote them, that's your prerogative; however, personal experience and [these statistics](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/2468/7579) suggest that people who ask them don't stick around to contribute to the site, so I don't agree with the premise that it makes any difference to site health whether we upvote them or not. We'll have to agree to disagree.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now I understand, if we take those statistics into consideration then we should remove identification tag because since its not contributing anything. Its not like I am totally against with this but we must allow this question to be discussed in chat rooms and there they can find answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shashank: They are not banned from the chat rooms, but whether anyone would entertain you is another matter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I actually downvote a large majority of identification requests and do not upvote any.


















During beta, it was suggested that embedded YouTube videos be turned on in this https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/434/17758meta post. I think that as a recreation site, it would be nice to have these links auto-embed similar to the way they do on Arqade and other stack exchange recreation sites. 

It seems this feature-request was ignored the first time around because the site was still in beta, so I'd like to see if we can get some traction on getting this turned on now that the site has graduated. 

Example questions where YouTube embedding could have been beneficial:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/30128/17758How can I improve the frame rate of a low frame rate anime?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/13637/17758Where does the word "Nyanpasu" come from?

It was ignored because no one could actually find any examples of answers which would be significantly improved  by allowing embedded videos. If you can find a few such examples that would go a long way to proving this would actually be useful here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An example that comes to mind is a question I want to post about how to increase frame-rate for low frame anime. There's an example video of this in action that would fit nicely into my answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll search for more examples throughout the site a bit later tonight. If anyone finds any they'd like to mention, feel free to edit the original post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Science Fiction and Fantasy also has this. From what I've seen, most of the answers that use embedded video don't actually *need* it; they could usually get by just as well with screenshots. But it can be a nice feature, as long as people still take the time to explain their answers and don't just plunk some video in and call it a day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We got it over [movies and TV in 2014](http://meta.movies.stackexchange.com/questions/631/video-embedding-for-movies-se) (before graduation) but its better if you can show few example where its required, as we did and it worked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyways i never realized its not present here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Due to the nature of our site, whatever we cite from youtube, it's most likely that they will be promptly removed in the future, except for AMV or very short excerpt from the anime. I don't think we really need them. As for existing posts, you can just embed an image from the anime instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No stack exchange site really "needs" videos. I don't think the argument of not needing them is a very good argument against having videos embed and not having to leave site to watch a video. Videos on YouTube *might* get removed, but that risk is already there with having a YouTube link included in an answer, embedding it doesn't increase that chance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Enabling YouTube would allow asker to just put the video up and ask question about it **without pointing to the exact episode/timestamp**, especially the case for the last half of your list. This makes such question not searchable, and editing them would require quite some effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That can happen just like it does now, and you would resolve it the exact same way: close as too little detail to be answered (minimum guidelines not met). YouTube is pretty well censored already, I think we should enable embedding.


















Personally, I tend to break down https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions into several parts and see if they suffice to it. 

One of the key points I base my https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request up-votes on would be the scope:


  Can the description and information they give match an XX amount of series, or more likely XXXX amount of series? 


Some simple mentions of a time-frame or a specific channel usually does the trick. This combined with a 'not too generic' description usually wins me over. This most of the time wins my up-vote, although some of these questions first require some editing. 

The second point I tend to look for is:


  proper English usage. 


Nobody is perfect, and I myself am nowhere near perfect English either. But at least a minimal effort can be put in, the rest can always be fixed by an edit by somebody who does know the proper way to phrase it.

The final point I judge the question on is:


  Is this a begging letter?


Some https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions tend to be 50+% of begging, feelings of nostalgia, despair, sadness and a puppy somewhere in the world might die if they do not get their answer, preferably yesterday than now. 

So a short run-down:


Did they sufficiently narrow down the scope?
Did they give an adequate description of the series/characters?
Has some effort been put in the English usage?
Is it not a begging/psychiatric letter?


But while I might base it all on this, if you are doubting, or not sure whether you should up-vote the question, then we can already say that the question was not especially useful or outstanding to you. And as you quoted yourself:


  Whenever you encounter a question, answer or comment that you feel is especially useful, vote it up!

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for "Some identification-request questions tend to be 50+% of begging, feelings of nostalgia, despair, sadness and a puppy somewhere in the world might die if they do not get their answer, preferably yesterday than now."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And of course, also for a good set of criteria for judging when to upvote them, if you insist on doing so. I use similar criteria for deciding when to not downvote.


















Often, I have a button next to review with a number on it. This number doesn't correlate to the number of posts available for me to review, as I can click on it and find no reviews available. What does this number mean? 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMjvA.png
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What does the button with a number next to review mean?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it is the number of posts up for review, but it doesn't count posts that you've already seen. So if there are five close votes and no other posts up for review, that number will be 5, but if you've already voted on three of the posts, the queue will only show two posts when you go to the review page because you can't review the same post twice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In addition of that, AFAIK, it's only showing total number of available "Suggested Edits"... oh, and also probably cached.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By the way, you can probably get a better answer for this at meta.stackexchange.com. They may have even answered it already.


















Recently I've seen a few id requests that say right in the question something like "By the way, this might not be anime." Usually they think it might be a Western cartoon. In one case the OP thought what he was looking for might be either Chinese or Russian (which is extra hard to decide on, because Chinese animation would be on-topic but Russian animation would be off-topic).

The first few were all horrible anyway, so I voted to close them as not meeting our minimum guidelines, but the last one I reviewed looked like an acceptable id request, except that the last sentence was "Also this might be an English-language cartoon." I skipped it since I wasn't sure what to do with it.

The problem here is that we're not a general purpose media identification service; Western cartoons and comic books are outside of our scope. If someone showed up here asking a question about Scooby Doo, we'd close it right away. In these cases, the OP thinks it might be anime, but also thinks it might not be, so it might be on-topic, or it might not be. 

What do we want to do with these? 



Note: Sometimes the OP doesn't say the show might be non-anime, but it turns out what they're looking for isn't anime. We can't do anything about that. This is only about cases where the OP actually writes in the question "This might not be anime" or includes a picture or something indicating that it's probably not anime.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Id requests that admit they might be looking for non-animeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5here is an [example](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/30138/tv-show-anime-with-horse-like-creatures-used-in-and-outside-of-races)


















My recommendations:

If the question doesn't meet our minimum standards, we should vote to close on that basis.

If it's about a work of animation and seems like a not utterly horrid question, migration might be an option. Science Fiction and Fantasy and Movies and TV both will take questions on Western animation. They probably don't have the same level of expertise that we do in identifying anime, but if the OP can't even remember whether what they're looking for is anime, they've come to the wrong site.

If it's about a manga that might be a Western comic, that could also potentially go to SF&F.

Any question that meets the minimum guidelines and can't be migrated should be closed as "Not about anime or manga."

Eventually, as people start to catch on to what we're doing, they'll probably stop saying it might not be anime and claim to be sure it was anime, even when they're really not sure. Of course, this will be just another of the manifold ways that people find to write awful questions, and there's nothing we can do about it. But we might as well do something with questions that straight up admit that what they're looking for might be outside our scope.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds like a good way to go ++


















I was just wondering, there is not much use in already answered ID requests and even unanswered ones. Once they are answered they are just left behind. 

ID requests is one of the most rapidly increasing tag questions because  new users tend to ask them first aside from anime recommendations

And I also noticed that several https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request already has duplicates

I was just thinking of maybe we can possibly compile them in a post here on Anime.SE and maybe use them as one of those https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2293/an-arsenal-of-tools-and-know-hows-for-tackling-identification-request-questions?s=1%7C0.4279arsenal of tools for tackling ID- requests.

Maybe we can format it like Q and A style where a single answer would consist of a certain tag with its corresponding ID requests like this :



Anime Title/tag
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/blue-genderblue-gender.

Answered ID requests:

suggestions for formatting would be discussed and accepted by everyone like in this post in meta

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1204/you-want-recommendations-heres-a-list-of-them?s=7%7C0.1449You want recommendations? Here's a list of them

It would be beneficial not only to the site but also to New users asking help identifying an anime title they don't remember. We can ask them to browse this compilation because maybe there is already an answer in this compilation.

And It could be much easier to answer ID-Requests.

Also, I would like to add that I Really like answering ID-Requests. Why? Its because in this I discover new and not so old but good anime that would add to my watch list.

This is just a proposal but if this is Approved I would be one of those SO much-willing to help. :)

I really hope you can consider this proposal.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did Someone already proposed compiling Answered ID requests in a meta post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that answered id requests are basically worthless--we had seven, [one](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28919/7579) [two](http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/6608/7579) [three](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/7856/7579) [four](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/14173/7579) [five](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/19943/7579) [six](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28919/7579) [seven](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/14186/7579) id requests looking for Shinzo, all with almost entirely different details. However, I don't think this proposal will help that problem...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...because they had almost entirely different details. I don't think reading old id requests will help much with answering new ones. And if you do need to read old ones, using the search bar or Google with site:http://anime.stackexchange.com is a more efficient way to find possibly relevant ones. Plus, this would be a *ton* of work; we have 2,111 id requests, and only 276 are unanswered. So it's a ton of work for marginal gains; even if doing this would give us a magic ring that would answer every id request to ever come to the site, it's still marginal gains.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda But If I want to still do this even by myself. (really love to organize things) would that still be rejected? I'll start as soon as possible if you would let me :) 2,000 ID requests isnt that big if your willing to do this. I'm not saying your _Not_ , I understand that not all of us have that much time to spend here in Anime.SE (except for Mods I guess) but if I spend and allot time each day doing this. I think I can manage. Please :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you just really, really want to do this on your own, nothing is stopping you. I personally don't think it's a useful project for the site, as Google is already a better way to find information for answering id requests. It's also not how I would choose to spend my time. But maybe other people in the community disagree with me. Even if the community doesn't think it's useful, you can still make e.g. a GitHub repo containing a Markdown doc containing your compilation of 2000 id request answers, and maintain it yourself as new answers come in.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda hmmmm on another site or a website or blog maybe? I can also make that as an advertisement for Anime.SE maybe? I would consider your comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would wait for someone else's input before you do anything. This meta question has only been viewed 13 times. It's not like I have the final say on site policy. Wait a few days and someone else a chance to speak up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you've found a very inefficient way to explore new anime. Have you tried browsing through user recommendations of the anime you already know and like? [(Example)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood/userrecs)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Additionally, ID requests may be removed completely from the site (this is not guaranteed, but such a possibility is very real) and in that case, advertisement of A&M through off-topic question type would become misleading.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aside from everything, [please join us in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-) where we can discuss everything in real time, probably with more users than here, and talk on other topics. Recommendations are what we do in chat, too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It kind of sounds like a custom 20Qs is what you want http://en.akinator.com/


















It is just as Torisuda says, just a indicator of the amount of items that are ready for review. This number tends to be a bit inacurate at times ;)


  This indicator is shown only to moderators and users who've gained access to the moderator tools. As such, it behaves in keeping with the design of those tools:
  
  If you poke around in /tools, you'll quickly notice that most of
  what's found there isn't directly actionable - it's informational!
  What you do with that information is up to you: hopefully, you've been
  around long enough now that you have some idea of how you want the
  site to be run, and are able to make good use of the information
  presented.

Should only show if review queues are overloaded.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao For smaller sites such as A&M indeed. All though I must say, I also only go to the review queue when the orange thingy pops up. But we could always make a feature request to give it some sort of threshold :)


















I'll go ahead and compile my comments into a real answer so that people can up- or downvote it.

It's true that answered id requests are basically worthless. This is one of the many reasons I don't think having id requests adds much to the site. For example, we had seven id requests looking for Shinzo—that's https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28919/7579one https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/6608/7579two https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/7856/7579three https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/14173/7579four https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/19943/7579five https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28919/7579six https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/14186/7579seven. Clearly the previously answered questions weren't helping anyone.

However, I don't think this proposal is an answer to that problem. The details the OPs remembered on each of those seven questions are different enough that the OP probably never would have realized the other six questions were looking for the same show.

I also don't think this proposal will be particularly helpful to people answering id requests. Google is an amazingly powerful tool for searching information, and not just information on our site. Chances are, if you can find the answer by browsing a giant list of previously answered id requests, you can find it more easily using Google. And if you do think that looking at previously answered id requests will help you, we have a search bar, which I used to find those seven questions looking for Shinzo. (I originally thought it was five, but the search turned up a couple I hadn't known about.) You can also use Google for that: do a search with site:http://anime.stackexchange.com. For instance, I found the Shinzo identification requests again by doing a search for shinzo "identification request" site:http://anime.stackexchange.com on Google.

I think the gains here will be marginal. If it were a small amount of work, it might still be worth doing, but it won't be a small amount of work; it will be gargantuan. We have over 2,000 identification request questions, with about 280 of them unanswered. So members of the site will have to go through the remaining ~1720 id requests, see what the answer turned out to be, then go to another page with an index of anime and manga, find the one which answered the id request, and edit the entry to add a link to the question. That's for the ones which actually have accepted answers; a bunch of them have answers which aren't accepted, because the OP ran off. A bunch also have answers in comment threads. So you have to read every piece of text on the page to make sure there isn't an answer buried in some comment thread underneath a wrong answer. And then we need people to keep doing this for every single new id request that gets answered. 

We don't actually have that many people on this site doing maintenance and review tasks. During the image-only id request cleanup, I kept seeing the same eleven or twelve names on all the close votes. So there's a shortage of workers even potentially willing to take on this gargantuan task.



Of course, if you just really really want to do this, regardless of the community's opinion, there's nothing stopping you. You can even do it offsite somewhere, like on GitHub or a blog, where you control the whole process. However, I would ask you not to promote Anime and Manga.SE as a site for identification requests; we already get plenty. 

(Digression: recently, I've been trying to find an alternative site where we can direct id requests, and I think I've stumbled on the reason why we get so many: because none of the other obvious sites (Reddit, Quora, Yahoo Answers, MyAnimeList, etc.) seem to do id requests. The ones I did see on those sites had been either completely ignored or sloppily answered with something that was obviously wrong. By contrast, a certain contingent of users here leap to answer id requests, and will levy the full force of their usually considerable research skills to find the answer. Thus, our legend spreads throughout the Internet as a magical site that can find "Evangelion" given the description "I watched it when I was young, there was this nerdy guy in a white shirt and this girl with red hair and in one episode they went to a hot spring".)



I'll end this answer with some personal advice, which you are free to take or ignore. It might sound harsh, but it's meant to be helpful, so read it in that spirit.

You seem to be extremely excited about participating on Anime and Manga. That's good! We need people who are excited to participate. At the same time, I've noticed you doing some things, especially in the review process, that aren't productive or go against the policies of SE in general or Anime and Manga in particular. One of these came up in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2749/7579Is there a meta post here on Anime.SE that explains user bans?. I think you're getting too excited and rushing ahead to do things without finding out beforehand whether your actions are welcome or useful. 

I recommend that you instead take your time getting acclimated to the site. Ask and answer questions instead of worrying too much about reviewing or side projects. Read the best questions and answers the site has to offer, and learn from them what a good question and a good answer look like. I think we have some of the most amazing posts on the entire SE network, and I learned a lot about what a good post looks like from reading them. Go to chat, if you want, and get other people's opinions. Doing this will also let you identify real problems that the community has, and come up with solutions that benefit everyone. SE is a community effort. Everyone builds and maintains the site together, and each site has a different culture. To make valuable contributions, you should make an effort to understand that culture.

But that sentence you quoted was not just about this single proposal; it was about a pattern of behavior I've seen from you that comes from your newness to SE. I am counseling you to first master the core of SE, recognizing and writing great posts, and spend some time to build reputation, both the fake Internet points kind and actual reputation among other members of the community. This will give you knowledge and perspective to address problems the site faces and propose solutions to them.


















I see way to many Identification requests get closed, even when they have enough unique information for someone to come up with an answer.  



Here is a list of Identification Requests that are closed, presumably due to a so-called "lack of information", despite the fact that they clearly had enough information that someone was able to post a correct answer:

So you think it's unfair that we ask ID posters to google keywords and look up similar works on anime/manga database sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase  No, in fact it's the opposite.   I think we should stop trying to do their research for them, and instead focus on answering questions that the OP doesn't even have the means to researchb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure we can easily distinguish between the two types. Or disallow the easily researchable and only allow non-researchable types. What if OP remembers some unique keyword and it makes their question searchable?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase You misunderstand me completely.  I am saying that we need to change our standards to forbid searchable questions.  I am saying that we need to change our standards to **allow** questions that are not searchable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5how do you think we can do that? Most users aren't aware they post searchable questions, or they're playing dumb and want us to search for themb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase I am not saying that we should ban searchable questions.  Yes, that would be unenforceable.  I'm saying that we should allow non-searchable questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you give an example of what you mean by searchable vs nonsearch able? I think the disconnect here is how to determine if something is searchable, as there can be some overlap that can cause ambiguity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Why do you need an exampleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Because there are people misunderstanding what you are trying to say here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ I've already given examples, and now I'm asking you for what purpose you need one so that I can understand what the confusion actually is about.  If I give examples that don't fulfill your purpose, we don't get anywhereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Basically I'm asking how do we differentiate something searchable from something non-searchable. WE don't want to encourage a lot of back and forth guessing which is why we ask the OP to provide as many details as possible. Most of the time the OP is too lazy to try searching for themselves because they don't know how to look or what resources to use. I don't understand what you mean when something is "unresearchable."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Every details provided it searchable is some way, but not every details given is actually correct. The greatest flaw behind id-requests is that they rely on human memory. Very few ppl have good memory, even fewer are good at describing what they remember.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ I've recomposed the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ The point was that people here predominantly ask for details that are easy to search and hard to remember like the date they saw it, when questions usually already contain details that are easy to remember, but hard to search, such as the strange power the protagonist had.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is true. As much as I'd rather them include *specific* details (as opposed to generalized details), we can't expect them to remember these specific details, specially after a long period of time. We ask them to provide more general details so we get more chances there is to make connections. We have a simplified checklist to help ppl: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/2662/63 We've made a lot of effort to try to accomidate new users in writing id requests. We're almost at the point where we're spoonfeeding them. Our ongoing reminders are getting tedious and wearing our patience thin.


















I see that many of these identification request are being downvoted or closed by the wrong reason. Take https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/30490/whats-this-funny-manhwa-calledthis one as an example.

In StackOverflow, if you are making a poorly contextualized question, you get a Too Broad or Unclear reason (depending on the question, but it will fall in those categories). That is the reason this question should be closed with. Certainly not offtopic, since it's on-topic with the site.

Please, fix the closure reason since it is itself unclear why you are closing. Yes, it has a clarifying text in lower font, but:


There's no connection between something being off-topic and something being poorly asked.
It will rarely be read by the OP and will only notice "Off-Topic" most of the times, which will rarely be helpful to improve the question.


Please remember: closures are meant to improve the question to fit the site format. If you can't find the appropriate reason to close, perhaps there is not, and you should downvote instead of just closing. Otherwise, redesign the close reasons.

My proposal: Unclear what you are asking

For those comparing the cases with SO: The only OT close reason which was used as wildcard is regarding typos in code. Others still match:


Environment issues are OT bc they do not belong to being code issues (they are better suited in SU.se, askubuntu, ...).
Debugging help could fit in programmers.se (depending on the case) or codereview (when a significant part works and you understand the specific algorithmic problem). Is not a specific issue in part of the code you want to solve.
Asking for libs is neither a problem about a specific problem in code lines. Softwarerecs.se is the appropriate site.
General programming questions go to programmers.se when they are about methodology details, language capabilities, or software industry. They are not about specific issues in some code lines.
Working code and ways to do it better have no issues in code lines (since the code... works) and it finds its place in codereview.se.
The keyphrase here is: those questions are not about a specific issue in the code lines. If you intend to specify the wrong code, you are suitable on SO. If your question is too broad or unclear, it will be closed. If your question is crap, it will be downvoted. If a question fails to be MCVE even being somehow clear, it will be downvoted. IF A QUESTION DOES NOT SHOW RESEARCH EFFORT, IT IS ENCOURAGED TO BE DOWNVOTED, not closed, provided it does not get additional reasons to get it closed.

Seriously?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are using custom off-topic reasons the way they are intended: to give individual communities the ability to set their own scope and standards (see https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/06/the-war-of-the-closes/). Rather, you should complain to Stack Exchange that "off-topic" is not a good descriptor for many types of questions we would like to close. Many have noted this in the past, but Stack Exchange has not changed the terminology, and we aren't going to stop closing questions just because they chose strange terminology.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also note that SO has off-topic reasons for debugging help, problems that can't be reproduced, and questions asking for off-site resources, even though those all still clearly fall within the scope of programming.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Asking for a specific resource is definity an off-topic in SO. It is not the same case anyhow. In thisb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Case, question seems to be OT for reasons other than the question topic (identification request)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5SO is not about programming or libraries. Is about specific programming tehnicalb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Issue. For programming-related issues, or software dev, you have programmers.se, for asking for libs and software, softwarerecs.se, and for code review: codereview.se. they have clearly defined topicsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is very much the same. Both sites have determined a specific class of questions that are within their stated scope (respectively, anime and programming), and both have  limited or excluded those questions by adding off-topic reasons. That is exactly what off-topic reasons are for, if you read the blog post I linked. The existence of other sites covering some of these holes is irrelevant. But in any case, I'm not here to debate the specifics of SO's closing system, which I consider to be among the worst in the whole network, and a very poor example for a site like us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Added edit. The ladt point is the key to understand why it IS different


















The reason it is 'off-topic' and not 'unclear' is because only the off-topic reasons are editable by the mods.

If we switch to unclear what you are asking we cannot guide users to the guidelines we want them to read.

This is a guideline in StackOverflow which tells the users to make minimally acceptable questions http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve. The exact same could be done without misusing the wording "Off-Topic"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LuisMasuelli you're absolutely right that the words "off-topic" are not correct with most of closures for that reason. It's just how the system of custom close reasons is designed to only allow to add reasons in the "off-topic" section. I don't think the SE developers are changing that anytime soon though, but you can find and upvote or bounty a meta proposition to change that.


















The idea behind a tag is to have a way to tag a question for people with knowledge about a subject to find questions that are within their scope of expertise. Our https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/taggingHelp Center defines it as:


  A tag is a word or phrase that describes the topic of the question. Tags are a means of connecting experts with questions they will be able to answer by sorting questions into specific, well-defined categories.


Animation mistakes are not the topic of a question, but rather the conclusion and result to research or answer to a question. Ryan's suggestion of retagging questions to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animation-mistakesanimation-mistakes after an answer deems it to be an animation mistake is not the way tags are meant to work. This line of thinking isn't in line with the way other tags are handled either; since we don't retag questions to meet the criteria of an answer in any other cases. 

Also, in such a scenario, who is really the judge of when to retag? While we do have community accepted answers indicated by upvotes on questions, it's rare that a question like this will have an official answer that would guarantee that it was a mistake: instead, answers to these types of questions rely on inference and references to source material.

Tags represent subjects that a group of people could have expert knowledge about. It seems unlikely that anyone could have expert level knowledge over the topic of animation mistakes. Instead, someone could have expert knowledge over an anime, including the mistakes that were made when adapting it to anime. The tag for the anime in question is sufficient in this case to find the correct person to answer the question. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So then what do we do when we find questions that are tagged incorrectly? Do we not change them to correct the mistake? Are you not trying to do that right now by saying the tag is incorrect and re tagging them? As for your idealism on Knowledge and being experts on the topic of a tag, Identification Requests Ruins that one, no one can be an expert on that, but its the biggest one this site has, why was it not banned a long time ago otherwise? Tags are for identification of the question, and pointing out that a question is asking about an error is a pretty big identifier.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, we retag questions that are tagged incorrectly. Right now, I'm suggesting that we remove this tag, which in turn would untag these questions. However, it would not leave them tagless. All of the existing tagged questions are tagged with an appropiate series tag, and can still be found by users with experience about the subject.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You bring up a good point of asking why we have the identification request tag. That tag has been a topic of discussion for a while on our site and while the biggest tag, it is also the tag which attracts the worst quality questions. So much so that we've had to create special guidelines for asking questions with that tag.  This particular meta thread is about the animation-mistakes tag and isn't the right place to have a discussion about identification requests, but I will say that I don't expect that tag to be around forever.


















We decided that while some anime can be identified with very https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/26896/17758few details, we should judge all ID requests the same, so we can form objective decisions on when to close and when not to close. The fact of whether or not it should be closed is not the same as if the question is answerable in its current state. 

However, these guidelines that we've created should not be a reason to prevent a user from adding an answer if a user feels like the information provided by the identification request is enough to answer the question. 

Whether or not you feel that an ID request is going to be closed is not a reason to prevent someone from adding an answer while the question remains open. Before it is closed, the community has yet to decide that it is off-topic.  

I say leave good answers to bad questions intact. The users added those answers the intent of helping someone out, there is no reason to remove the answer if it meets our normal quality checks for answers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, helping someone is not a bad thing.


















tl;dr
No, we shouldn't. These questions are crap, and answering them will encourage more questions like them. On the other hand, there's pretty much nothing we can do to stop people from answering them, so deciding here that we shouldn't answer them is basically meaningless. Therefore, we shouldn't sanction the answers unless we're going to finally ban id requests altogether. If id requests are on-topic, then no matter how crappy the question is, we shouldn't punish people who post answers. (Unless their answer is also crappy, which is frequently, but not universally, the case.) Whether to answer a crappy question or not should be a personal decision; whether the question is crappy enough to close remains a community decision.
The exposition
As I wrote on another answer somewhere around here, I recently did some incredibly superficial research to find out if there was anywhere else on the net that we could direct people with id requests so we could at least get rid of some of them. I know Movies and TV found somewhere to send people (it was on one of their community ads), so they've been able to relieve the pressure a little.
I checked the usual suspects: Quora, Reddit, Yahoo Answers, and the forums at MyAnimeList, Crunchyroll, and AnimeSuki. You'd think, with the number of id requests we get here, that at least one of those places would also be flooded with them, but no, they had plenty of other stupid questions, but no id requests. Quora seems to have a pretty small anime segment anyway, but Reddit's is pretty huge and they weren't doing id requests at all that I could see, nor was Crunchyroll. On Yahoo Answers and MyAnimeList there were a few that went like this:

Question:
hai gaiz when i was younger i saw this anime...it was like about these people with like speclial powers who fghout over justize adn stuffs...teh op was like "DUH NUH NUH NUH NUH DUH NUH NUH" and it said the name of the show that i cat rememeber lol...anyone of u know it?
Answer:
Boku no Pico.

The thread would then promptly die.
On AnimeSuki they actually did have an identification thread where people could post id requests, but it was all one big long thread, so new id requests would get buried way at the back of fifty pages of off-topic posts.
On the other hand, suppose someone posted that question on Anime and Manga SE:

Question:
hai gaiz when i was younger i saw this anime...it was like about these people with like speclial powers who fghout over justize adn stuffs...teh op was like "DUH NUH NUH NUH NUH DUH NUH NUH" and it said the name of the show that i cat rememeber lol...anyone of u know it?
Commenters:
This can't be answered without more detail. Voting to close.
Answer:
This is clearly Ore no Udon Monogatari, an obscure shounen series from the 1980s based on a sentai show of the same name, released in English as Yoodon Fighters. It ran for 147 episodes from 1985 to 1987. I figured it out because your "DUH NUH NUH NUH NUH DUH NUH NUH" was clearly a phonetic representation of a song composed in 17/68 time on a 1983 Yamaha Model IVB synthesizer, the exact same measure and machine used by 80's synth band Rock the Prevarication, who performed the OP for the English release, which isn't mentioned on Wikipedia because it was only broadcast in the US for three days, and only in areas with zip codes ending in odd, prime Catalan numbers that fulfill the Goldbach conjecture.

My point is, as far as I could see, we're basically the only site on the net that consistently gives good answers to awful, vague id requests. Our users seem to have vast knowledge of anime and manga and to enjoy using their time to answer people's ill-defined questions. We get results, so our legend spreads as a magical place where wishes come true, as long as those wishes involve finding out the name of some anime you saw a long time ago that you barely remember.
If we want to discourage people from posting such bad questions, we have to stop answering them. We have to become as useless as the rest of the Internet at answering these questions.
Why we can't stop
On the other hand, even if the entire Metaclass, the class of users containing everyone who participates in Meta and is worried about closing questions and maintaining quality, decides to stop answering awful id requests, they are still going to get answered by other users who aren't aware of our policy, or don't agree with it and have decided to just ignore it instead of arguing.
We really have no way to enforce this except closing awful id questions faster, and I'm not sure we can do it any faster; we've already got our moderators working like demons (welcome to MgRonald's, demonic Toshinou Kyouko) to mop up all the terrible id questions that show up every day, and in the absence of anyone armed with a Hammer of the Mods, it seems to take about 16 hours for a close vote to coalesce around a question. That's more than enough time for someone to come along and slip in an answer.
And while lots of those answers suck, there are also lots like my model answer above: so thoroughly researched as to be almost miraculous. As much as I hate these questions, and as much as I wish we could get rid of them (I recently blocked the tag just so I wouldn't have to look at them anymore), it seems wrong to sanction good answers even if they're answers to crappy questions. We should sanction answers that suck, but we should do it because they suck, not because the question they answer sucks.
Unfortunately, it's a little more complicated than that, because I absolutely do think that users getting answers for crappy id requests that don't meet the standard before they can be closed sends the message that they can ignore the guidelines and still have a good chance of getting an answer. But as I said above, I don't think we can stop this practice anyway, except by banning id requests. The users who post crappy answers probably won't be bothered, because they're just as oblivious to the sanctions as the people posting crappy questions. The people who post good answers, on the other hand, will be hurt and offended that we've sanctioned their answer when the question was completely clear and obvious to them.

What is that?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@D.Tanya It's net speak for a basic summary for people who don't want to read the whole thing.


















We (me and a vague but definitely real group of users) in the http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-Maid Café would like to make some games. If you are interested, ping me in chat or post/comment here.

There are no limitations, but consider these things:


It should be fun. Pretty sure nobody here likes text-based "Choose your own adventure" genre, Match-3 or Pinball. Ask yourself if you would have fun making and then playing something;
If we want to make a game sooner rather than later, the core game should be short and simple to make;
If we want to make a game at all, 2D is the faster route than 3D.


Use answers for game propositions. If you have some other ideas, http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-let's discuss them in chat.



Whatever you have in mind, don't hesitate to post it!

I'm just explaining my personal concerns about starting a collaborative project which often die soon because the goals are too high for project members. Compare the amount of artwork and story writing needed for an average VN and an average arcade game, and you'll see what I mean. But if suddenly a very dedicated group of people appears that want and will make a VN, I'd only be happy for them.

Part of the gig is learning how to use C#, Unity and whatnot for game development.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's make some games!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5would we be looking to make money out of the game?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Two questions: a) Is the game necessarily going to be anime-themed in some way? b) What's the tech stack? I imagine that will limit some people; for instance, I've never written a line of C# and don't particularly want to learn it, so anything that uses Unity or .Net in general is out for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No theme requirements, I'm just giving examples of what is in my opinion a viable project. You can do whatever you want, if you think you can. Use whatever programming language and game engines. I will probably be using Unity and C#. I know C# and will be able to explain most language features to others, if anyone will be interested.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Making money is not the goal, but if we suddenly come up with something very good (which I doubt coz how many of us are that good at making games?) we could discuss that, why not. Basically, the goal is to have fun, to make some game, and to learn in the process about making games, programming and other gamedev related knowledge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like pinball... :(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it turns out to be unity I would also be able/willing to help out :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm really curious why someone downvoted this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most of the Links are broken [Check out this Town Management game idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15PziVVGKNBEUKhJo_lKGAvVcuVSXtR60DZSzndSYypk/edit?usp=sharing), [playable basic mechanics prototype](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8efZIZWps9BcWEwS05QT2F2cmc), and [these rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O38jiuas7keFNQ15sF5j4xVAMBIv02lhIcQuj_rXLIw/edit?usp=sharing)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko I like Metroid Pinball from DS, and Sonic Pinball in Sega Genesis :)


















2D Tower Defense

Like http://store.steampowered.com/app/102600/Orcs Must Die or http://store.steampowered.com/app/65800/Dungeon Defenders.

Basic game:


On a pre-made level enemies follow a path to the "End". If just one enemy reaches the end, you lose.
Enemies are generated in small batches. Let's say 1 every second for a batch of 5, with a delay of 20 seconds between batches.
Enemies can be killed by traps that automatically trigger when enemies step on them, and need 10 seconds to reset. Trap can kill all enemies within its trigger zone.
Player can install a limited number of traps throughout the level. Inefficient placement will result in enemies passing through them.
Player can kill all enemies within some range from the cursor, with a significant delay. We'll figure out the game balance in the process.


Extended game:


More levels with multiple paths, possibly randomly generated from pre-made chunks;
Enemy types resistant to certain attack types (like ice and fire);
Trap types more efficient and useless against various enemy types;
Different player attacks;
Better art and sound? eh 


If you're interested in this idea, or you want to propose changes, comment below.

It might be useful for those who have less time to complete.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this idea has the best prospect of completion at this point. If the team meshes and the game turns out well, there's nothing keeping the team from moving on to a different game with the experience in creating this one.


















TCG (Trading Card Game)

examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Trading_Card_GameYu-Gi-Oh, https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/5825/1587Weiß Schwarz, http://www.tantocuore.com/about.htmTanto Cuore

Basic Game:


1 VS 1 with a Computer Opponent
1 VS 1 with Human Opponent
1st Series of cards
In-game slideshow explaining rules


Extended Game


2 VS 2 Tag Team
More Series of cards
Playable Tutorial
Single Player Story Mode(s)


Unlocking of more AI Opponents with themed decks/strategies
A new Story Mode for every released series
Tutorial can be integrated into story



Notes


Card Game rules will need to be discussed (personally i liked Yu-Gi-Oh's approach)
New cards can be added later by players in a similar way to how League of Legends for Forum RPGs allows players to make new Characters

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would limit the basic game to pvp as making an AI can bog a team down. Also, rather than a tutorial, a quick video demo is probably better, as tutorials have to be pretty well thought out to be effective. once v1 is done there's nothing keeping the team from working on an AI.


















Trajectory shooting game
example: http://gamewise.co/games/49267/DDTankDDtank
Introduction
It might be difficult but its my suggestion because I love these types of games. Trajectory shooting game will be like every person will have their own weapon and that player will use that weapon to throw it in the air and kill his opponent by correct amount of strength. Since it will be trajectory motion therefore player can adjust their angle and then throw object to hit their target. Also this game might be calculative one because users have to first calculate the correct amount of power and angle to throw object so that it will hit the target.
Basic game:

Human vs Computer. Like both players having health and both of them trying to kill each other by throwing objects.
And Human vs Human matches.
Wind system like due to wind the trajectory motion gets disturbed which will make every round different and difficult.
There can be tutorial at starting showing how to play the game and how to improve their skills. It is important for players to learn how to play this game and how to calculate so that they can hit target.

Extended Game

We can use team vs team game match where every team got one chance to attack.
It can be boss level fight. Boss level fight means player have to complete each level to earn level or any item etc.
There can be armory settings like to increase defense and many more.
Restricting the angle for different weapons.
There can be different maps for various matches.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5sounds like [gunbound](http://gunbound.softnyx.net/). I would limit the basic game to pvp as making an AI can bog a team down. Also, rather than a tutorial, a quick video demo is probably better, as tutorials have to be pretty well thought out to be effective. If you stick with PVP then a wind system is not needed for version 1.


















I answered a question, but it doesn't follow with the majority's conjecture and is being downvoted.  Should I just delete my answer?  And if I do, will that reverse the negative reputation points?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does deleting an answer remove the negative points to your reputation?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why do you assume that it's being downvoted just because it "doesn't follow with the majority's conjecture"? Maybe it's not well-supported by evidence, or needs sources, or is too short or confusingly written. When I downvote answers, it's usually through the review queues; I don't even see the other answers, so I downvote for one of those reasons, not because it's out of sync with the other answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to try improving your answer instead of deleting it, you can make another meta post with a link to your answer and ask for advice. Since we're a small site, asking for advice and making improvements usually gets enough attention that people will come and reverse their downvotes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm basically with Dimitri's answer, but it would require more work to improve your answer and to backup your claim. (I can see another detail in the pictures that hasn't been mentioned yet, which supports the other answers.) Even though I liked parts of your answer and I can see that you put considerable effort into it I will be downvoting your answer as it currently is and thus giving you a chance to earn a badge. I would be happier though to see more structure in your answer and understanding that it's not subjective bias why you received negative votes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you very much for commenting on my question.  I have gone back to the episode in question and reviewed it several times and I am now ready to edit my previous answer.  After I have done so, I will follow Torisuda's advice and post it to the Meta asking for advice.  @LiveWireBT - what did you mean when you said you were 'giving me a chance to earn a badge'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jinoshio http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/badges/38/peer-pressureb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LiveWireBT - lol, thanks!  But, that's not a badge to strive for...I think.  :)


















This was an idea for a game i thought up while playing Minecraft and tried to duplicate with mods but couldn't get close. the idea is that you would find a town and set yourself up with a job there whether that be starting a farm to supply their food or working, a guard to protect it or a smith/builder.

with these jobs you have different levels of responsibility ie.


with the farmer you with just harvest the crops or own the farm itself and handle all the fiances including hiring other farm hands
with a guard you can just follow your orders or be the town commander and order where your guards patrol


and later if you don't want to be tied down in a single town you can go out and explore or even take up the job as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C5%8DninRonin or a Traveling Merchant like Kraft Lawrence and Holo from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_and_WolfSpice and Wolf or up and just move to another village

Basic Features

low rep can get you attacked by guards or thrown in jail
high rep can earn you discounts and favours

Town relations


Town Guard can launch attacks against enemy towns
trading items gotten from one town to another which they don't like can lower your rep as a merchant

Lawful Towns people wont have to worry about theft.
the opposite end is https://i.stack.imgur.com/gUfY7.pngTortuga for pirates/bandits to sell their wares

Different kinds of houses to buy
ability to build your own house (either outside town limits or buy a plot of land in town)


ships will have a generic base but can be built on as if they are moving land

for pirates and bandits you can infiltrate a town, get info on guard placements or influence your new "friends" to help weaken a town from within
dating/marriages/children (same sex relationships included)

Quests
Bosses
Different Town Cultures (can limit jobs/traceable items)
Add iconic towns like http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/KonohagakureKonohagakure or http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Ba_Sing_SeBa Sign Se and add jobs associated with them such as Ninja, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRC_iNWt7kMRamen Delivery Guy, Dai Li Agent or Dragon of the West Tea Shop Guy

So https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/31063/why-do-people-tend-to-think-anime-is-weird-pornoWhy do people tend to think anime is weird porno? got closed as opinion based. 

Personally I don't consider this to be opinion based, as the question states


  Is there a specific reason as to why this stereotyping came to be?


Which as far as I believe could be backed up by facts. The comment by Toshinou also seems to hint to this.

So, why is it considered opinion based?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is this question regarded as opinion based?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Something tells me this opinion of anime as being just porn comes from watching scandalous news reports on tv about how "perverted japanese cartoons make people into weirdos". That's not my opinion, btw, it's the reality. Potential answerers can probably find hard info on such misconceptions, so the question should be reopened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I voted to close, and I confess I did so without strong conviction. The wording of the title sounded really naive, and you started by bringing up that "summarize Sword Art Online for my mom" question that I hated. It seemed like a question that was going to attract a lot of whining and ranting instead of good answers. But the question is open again, and Toshinou-san's answer is really good, so I admit I was wrong and the people who reopened it were right.


















I noticed recently that a tag for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/europeeurope exists, which seems to serve the purpose outlined https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2702/2604here. However, currently there are only two questions in it, which look like they could be better served with country-specific tags:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/30557/2604Non-independent stores in the UK that sell manga: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdomunited-kingdom seems more appropriate.
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/26956/2604Where can I read Bleach legally?: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/norwaynorway seems more appropriate. In particular, licensing restrictions may not uniformly apply across Europe. (e.g. This is what I extrapolated from https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/30593/2604here.)


I can surely imagine instances where the tag could be useful (e.g. when asking about conventions), but I'm less sure of the fit in these specific cases.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the Europe tag have been used for these questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5this one also which I just added: http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/18464/how-much-english-is-spoken-at-japan-expo-paris/19795#19795 (France)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How granular should we get - UK can be split into several areas too. We could have >200 country-based tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also found these, which have country-based tags: [Greece](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/30928/2604), [Spain](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28950/2604).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko: I'm not sure about tag "precision". Maybe it should be on a case-by-case basis? Either way, country-level tags at least seem like a good place to stop, somehow, but I'm not entirely sure.


















Right now we're (the mods) in the midst of figuring out what to do about our current "identification-request" issue. It's a complicated and deeply rooted issue with with no easy resolution. We're weighing a lot of different opinions and statistical data in order to come up with some sort of solution or compromise. Please be a bit patient and continue with your efforts in closing bad https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request question that don't meet our minimum guidelines, while we try to figure things out. We realize that no matter what conclusion we come, not everyone will be satisfied. Finding a compromise to all of this what I believe to be the most complicated part of about it.

Additionally, I'm looking to find a way to standardize series tag naming. As you've noticed, sometimes we use the romanized Japanese title names while other times we use the English title names. Originally user which ever title had the most search results, typically the romanized Japanese titles are more popular for new series, while older series more well-known series might skew toward their English titles.

We're very inconsistent and I would like to take some times and implement a more consistent policy of for series titles.    

Please look forward to these changes are coming soon. If you have any question or concerns or would like us to address an issue that you wish to see addressed, please feel free to leave a post on this thread and we'll try to address it as best we can.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Community Notice: Pending policy changes on the horizonb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5imo, the opinions should be what *objective* criteria the decision should be made with and then seeing what kind of data mods can get access to in order to determine whether the data meets the criteria. The data the regular users have access to are not enough to determine the criteria I had set myself a year or two back. As I see it, a big part of the problem is that we don't have the data to back the assertions that have been made about this issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i hope that if id requests become off-topic and we should start removing them there is announcement before hand we start the removal. i want to get all the anime/manga/light novel titles i've discovered from id requests before we get rid of themb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is not a "complicated" issue, and there _is_ an "easy" resolution that would have been even easier if you/we hadn't sat on your/our hands for years.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is unclear to me why standardizing series tag _names_ is something that is worth putting effort into, when adding _synonyms_ for series tags ― which is by far easier _and_ more useful to question-askers ― has mostly not happened.


















So...in terms of the identification-request matter...


  We're weighing a lot of different opinions ...


What options were you considering, or would this sort of thing be a bit of an overreach to ask at this point?

  This discussion is now closed.
  https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2812/identification-request-cleanup-phase-1-deprecationHere's phase 1 of what we've decided to do about identification-requests (deprecating).
  https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2824/identification-request-cleanup-phase-2-blacklistingHere's phase 2 (blacklisting).
  https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3839/49Here's phase 3 (delete and lock).


TL;DR for those who want to find alternative resources for ID request: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4189/2516What identification requests are acceptable here? Otherwise, where else can I possibly get helped with it?



The topic of id-request is a very subjective one. I believe that it's difficult to provide an objective data for analysis. Afterall https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causationcorrelation does not imply causation.

Id-requests are something we struggled with dealing with since they first came up on our site. Objectively on paper, they can make decent questions. But in practice, this is far from true. Some common complaints about these types of question are that:


They are too localized and oftentimes vaguely worded, and typically unhelpful to other users. Someone trying to remember the same thing as you might recall certain details more vividly than others, this oftentimes results in different descriptions of the same thing. 

There's no easy way to resolve this. Answering identification question is not unlike giving directions: if you don't give someone good directions they'll have a hard time finding what they are looking for. 

Take a look at this map, made by a directionally-challenged character from a popular manga:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/pChxY.png

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Utzed.jpg 

Would you find what you're looking for or where you need to go? The place you're looking for based off of these directions? Probably not. However more often than not we get users the ask question that feel like these maps, despite our attempts to help them include better details with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/891/what-criteria-should-we-use-for-qcing-for-all-identification-request-questions/892#892our guidelines. 
Users make little effort, but expect the world in return. We've seen a lot of these types of id request questions. Most of them are in the form of image-only id requests, which got out of hand really quick, mostly because the ones asking the question almost never tried doing a reverse image search themselves and expect us to do it and tell them. We're not here to be someone's personal search engine/concierge service, we're here to ask and answer questions about the world and culture of anime and manga. Filling our site with these questions can be as bad as watching filler episodes of a long-running anime. It gets us nowhere. 

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2725/policy-review-image-only-id-requests/2726#2726Since then we've disallowed media-only (only a link to an image, audio, video) identification questions, but we've made some provisions to allow users to ask questions about identifying specific https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosplaycosplay, and the rare but occasional https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/itashaitasha, using actual pictures that you've seen or taken yourself. 

As of this post, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp center topic for what's on-topic and our https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourtour page have been updated to note that users should follow these guidelines when asking identification request questions, including our updated stance on media-only identification requests. 
Rarely do users that ask id-requests stick around or bother to come back. Statistically speaking the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2467/can-we-get-some-more-definitive-numbers-on-identification-request-statsretention numbers on id-request askers are low. Not only that, but a fair number of them are asked by unregistered users, whose  accounts are cookie-based and volatile, meaning that once they lose their session cookie, they have no way of logging back to this account (without registering that account). This results in many id request questions being essentially abandoned.


While we care about making more of an effort to downvote and close these questions, the fact that these post continue to pop up and with the same issues, is a bit of a cause for concern.

I, for one, do not like to see the current trend of where identification questions are going and would like to start deprecating them. We've made many efforts and guides to help users write better identification questions, but as time goes by, reminding them of such gets pretty tedious. Our previous stance was to downvote and close these questions based on our guidelines. That's all fine and done, but it requires users to actively pay attention to these questions as they come up via the review queue or on the main page. Instead of devoting our time to dealing with these questions, I'd like to see our community's efforts direct to community development between users. We've done gift exchanges, viewing sessions, and even a multi-discipline project like game development: I'd like to see us nurture this spirit more. Therefore, I believe it's in the community's best interest to deprecate and eventually remove identification questions in their entirety from our site. 

I do understand that there is opposition to removing the questions completely, which is why I'd like to give them one last chance to not only be heard but also defend their position on this matter and what they believe would help improve the situation of dealing with the influx of low quality and abandoned id-requests. Maybe we've overlooked something, maybe we could have done something better, or maybe we went about things in the wrong manner.

You may discuss or scrutinize the plans as much as you'd like here on meta or in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-our main chat room. Regardless of how much or how little reputation you have in this community, your proposal will be heard equally, as long as there is consensus on it within the community. However, note that this is likely to be the final time to voice your opinions. I would like us to finally reach a decisive conclusion on this matter once and for all.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What we'd like to do about those gosh darn "identification requests" questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is the part where I get to say I TOLD YOU SO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin Yes, you did. You were right.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why not just do like Arqade and require a screenshot, video, or audio clip?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So... the end result is now that all these questions just end up on scifi.SE, which is probably less-better-equipped to answer them. Personally I would've been much happier to see these type of questions retained and allowed here, but only allowed to remain open if they were of high quality, i.e. had sufficient detail to be answered.


















I am against keeping identification question on the site and I believe that there are quite a few users within the community that feel that same way on this matter. I would like to propose the following plan for deprecating and getting rid of them:

Start closing all NEW https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions with a modification to the existing off-topic close reason to remind users that all identification questions are off-topic. All users are encouraged to vote to close them as they pop up.

After 30 15 days, blacklist the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request and associated tag synonyms, close ALL remaining https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions, and apply a https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126587/what-is-a-historical-lock-and-what-is-it-used-forhistorical lock to them. This will most likely be done via a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/feature-requestfeature-request to the CMs.

After 60 30 days, delete all https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions with a score of 3 or less less than 4, without at least one answer with a score of 3 or more. The ones that remain will serve as a reminder to other (new) users that while we have allowed these question in the past, these question are no longer on-topic on our site. These questions will remain and be https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/untaggeduntagged and locked permanently. Future questions should not only be locked, but also deleted.
Doing so will is meant to preserve some of the better identification request questions for purposes of keeping historical artefacts. The three-step process is meant to be less abrupt and ease everyone into the removal of the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag and questions tagged with it.


Removing the tag will most definitely have a rather significant impact on our question and answer count. This is why, in return, I would like to us to start organizing more community events to talk about, recommend, and watch anime in a monthly basis (or weekly, if the initiative gains enough traction).
Some examples would be short weekly collaborative watch sessions for on-going seasonal anime (two sessions, each one for people in different time zones), and a monthly binge session of an entire complete series or set of movies following a theme (there will be 2 time slots to accommodate different time zones as well).
There is also the possibility of hosting themed community events involving asking question on certain tags: we've done similar things in the past, both when with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tags-by-season?sort=newest&pageSize=50seasonal tags and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/510/april-fools-2013themed tags.
I'll give you guys until the end of the next month (May 8th) to mull over this, before implementing anything.

[I've created an SEDE query](http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/476493/identification-questions-with-a-minimum-question-score-and-answer-score?MinQuestionScore=10&MinAnswerScore=5) to play around with min question score and min answer score.  You can see if there's anything that's exemplary in there, but I'm not as confident.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, I see no reason why the blacklist couldn't be instantaneous outside of technical limitations, which would imply that we need more hamsters for the server farm... ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Here's the same query](http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/476493/identification-questions-with-a-minimum-question-score-and-answer-score?MinQuestionScore=10&MinAnswerScore=5) revamped to indicate if a question has been closed.  If you want to *exclude* those kinds of questions, it's not too tough from here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is step (2) going to "catch" questions like [this one](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/12989/2604), which presumably might still be acceptable under the new policy?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon It should be possible to catch questions like that fairly easy by looking for [identification-request] posts that are also tagged with a series or movie. Also your SEDE query doesn't seem to match the criteria given in this post for an id-request to not be deleted. As I read it, if question has a score of 4 or more, OR if a question has an answer with a score of 4 or more it's not deleted. Here's an updated query: http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/476523/identification-questions-that-wouldnt-be-deletedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon that one should have never been tagged with id-req. Id-reqs should never have a series tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Curious, would asking to id the name of a doujin that belongs to a series based off a page or id-ing music from within a series become off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X Music identification is series specific, so it's not an id-req. Questions about doujinshi should be acceptable. However identifying a doujinshi of a specific series is an id-req and should not include a series tag as there really is no direct connection. However if you wish would like to ask about finding a doujinshi a specific author did on a specific series, then you can use the author name and the series name as tags. This makes identifying the title more specific and answerable, as opposed to grasping for straws in the dark like we currently do for id-reqs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge:  That was actually my query, and I do feel like it's an AND - we're trying to catch questions with a score greater than 3 and at least one answer with a score greater than 3.  That actually shows what's going to be *kept*.  If you want the inverse, flip the inequalities.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto Sorry, about the misattribution. That's not what "questions with a score of 3 or less without at least one answer with a score of 3 or more"  means. It means a question must have score of 3 or less AND be without at least one answer with a score of 3 or more" in order to be deleted. If you reverse it you get "a question must have a score of 4 or more OR have (be not without) at least one question with a score of 3 or more" in order to be kept.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When will this closure come into effect? We will need a new closure reasonb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko well it hasn't been a week since this meta was even posted. i know all out VTC Trigger Fingers are twitching with anticipation we need to give the subject a bit of time so people can have their sayb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X indeed - I should have been clearer, I just would like some disambiguity between the "Now" now and the "Now" in the future, so that people aren't confused.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5++++++1, go forward, so that i can also stole the idea for movies.se and give a successful example of implemented site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You said in the question that we have until May 8 to make our case, but you'll start implementing things after May 1? Suggestions: 1) before implementing anything, it would be courteous to the community to provide in the post a SQL query (probably not the one updated by Ross Ridge) that correctly identifies the questions that would be removed according to the criteria. 2) divide the post removals into phases, so for example you'll delete questions with negative scores with no upvoted answers by date XXX, then you'll delete questions with  3 scores by date YYY.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have a slight objection to the criteria. I think if an answer gets >= 3 (or 5) votes on questions with = -1 votes, they should be considered before deleting them right away. 3 is the mark for well-received (or good) posts on SE. Also, is there any way to separate the upvotes from the downvotes? IMO, a post with 3 upvotes and 3 downvotes is different from a post with 0 upvotes and 0 downvotes, although both balance out to be 0 net score. By design, an upvote assigns more reputation than a downvote takes away, so 3/3 is not equivalent to 0/0.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao May 1st is a typo on my part. May 8th is the drop dead date. Using [this modified query](http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/480246/identification-questions-that-wouldnt-be-deleted-q4-a3?MaxQuestionScoreToDelete=3&MinAnswerScoreToKeep=3) you can see the questions that will be kept as of this post there are 413, which is still a lot.  There are currently about 2,194 id-req questions. I believe that shifting through them is them and removing it bit by bit has no actual benefit. Afterall someone has to spend time sift through these questions and schedule the tasks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao Just because 3 pp upvote a question, while 3 ppl downvote it doesn't make it a "good" question. It makes the question controversial. We want to leave some of the better examples of id-req as an example of how they should be asked or answered, but at the same time, we don't want too many of them to be left over as they will be tagged as "untagged."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Thanks for the explanation and prompt edit. The current criteria seems be the best option for now, even though I believe many on that list aren't worth keeping and some not on that list are.


















For questions like these two:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/28786/1587How much difference is there between Chronicles of the Going Home Club anime and manga?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/31605/1587Why is the Black Jack anime and manga so different?


I feel a tag called https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/media-differencemedia-difference could be added, used for when one is asking about difference between anime/manga/light novel adaptations. i.e., how much of a manga has a anime adapted or asking about content difference between a manga and light novel (like with From the New World).

While I can just make this tag myself, I was hoping to check whether making this tag would be of any benefit beyond just me thinking it would be good to have it in the mix.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag Proposition: media-comparisonb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't believe such a meta tag is useful to have. I mean, what function do you believe such a tag would have on it's own, as compared to it existing in tandem with a series tag? Meta tags should be able to able to be used on their own w/o another tag. [tag:anime-production] is a good example of this. Comparing differences between media with the same title should fall under the series title tag itself. If it's a question specific to the anime, then why not use the [tag:anime-production] tag along with it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unrelated: Any idea what's up with spelling "manga" in camelcase? I've that happen sometimes around here, and am not sure where it comes from...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat it's probably just a odd stylistic choice.


















I'm on the fence about this but because no one has posted a contrary opinion yet, I'll offer this up. I'm uncertain about this because as I see it, there's one good reason why identification questions should be a banned, and few admittedly not as good reasons why they should be allowed. Given the balance between the two, I'm of the opinion we should err on the side of caution and so continue to allow identification requests.

One good reason to get rid of them

Identification requests have one fundamental problem, and it's a pretty damning one. It unlikely that when answered they'll be all that helpful to anyone other than person asking the question. That's not what these Stack Exchange sites are supposed to be about. If questions only helped the asker then it wouldn't be worth the expense of running a site like this. The value in these sites comes from the fact that one question can end up helping a lot of people.

Now, I'm not saying questions should judged based on how many people they might help. There is a good reason why the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/185102/responding-to-your-too-localized-concernsold "too localized" close reason was removed, there just isn't a good way to set objective criteria for judging whether individual posts could help "enough" people. This is different though, this is an entire class of questions that don't seem to add much value to the site. That's a reasonable justification for not allowing them.

A few reasons to keep them

The one saving grace here is that while identification requests are unlikely to be helpful to someone else trying to identify something, they still are of some value to people browsing the site. I read them to see if they mention anything interesting, some show that I never heard of and may like. It's not big thing but they do seem to gather views at rate similar to other kinds of posts, so they must have some value beyond helping the person asking the question.

What I think is the most compelling reason to keep them is that we seem to do a relatively good job of answering them. There doesn't seem to be another place that does a better job. It's not a question of the site lacking the expertise. There's also nothing that makes these questions fundamentally unanswerable or outside the scope of the site. This isn't a case where these questions don't fit the Q/A format. They aren't ones we can say are better suited to a more traditional discussion forum.

While this doesn't matter much as it used to, getting rid of identification requests would take a big chuck out of the activity on this site. The good thing is that since this site is no longer in beta, there's no fear of closure as a result (plus they changed graduation criteria so it's no longer activity based anyways). Still, it's not obvious this would help improve the overall health of the site. It's easy to say that people asking identification requests almost never post again and aren't contributing to the site, so banning them won't hurt, but that is actually hard to measure. While it's true not many accounts post again, it's hard to say how many people are posting using new accounts, having forgotten or lost the old one.

The lowered activity can have snowball affect as well. People who see a less active site are not as likely to become active. If you're someone like me, who isn't interested in shounen fighting anime, then this site effectively becomes a lot less active. I've probably read more identification questions here than not. Active users may end up becoming less active.

So I think there's actually some risk to banning these questions. There's lots of hard to predict ways their absence could negatively affect activity, like less word of mouth, lower search rankings, and the site not showing up in the "Hot Network Questions" list as much (though this site's id requests don't seem to show up there as much as other sites). 

Finally, another reason to keep them is the fact that things have actually gotten better. The site now has better criteria for closing bad identification questions. The growth in these questions has plateaued, and no longer http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/261651/the-identification-requests-are-taking-over-cumulative?TagName=identification-request#graphthreaten to take over the site. So, just when they've gotten under control they should now be eliminated completely?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for raising the possible snowball effect and not knowing if id askers return and registered for new account. As to how helpful ids are, I liken them to questions on code review. Unless you're reviewing code for a popular project, they aren't likely to help many people, yet code review exists as an SE subnetwork.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[It actually *is* easy to say that users that post identification requests don't contribute to the site.](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/2468/102)  The activity from users asking identification requests here is sporadic and not long lasting, and if we're basing our participation on one of those statistics alone, then we're in a pretty bad spot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto As I said it's easy to get numbers based on accounts. Finding numbers based on actual people is harder.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the point that these questions can be interesting to read, but lately, I frankly haven't really enjoyed reading the questions that have popped up, so this doesn't really help me enjoy the site more (even though as of right now, I'm not interested in most of the anime that has been asked about on the front page).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"There doesn't seem to be another place that does a better job." - my house could, in principle, serve as a venue for persons looking for a place to fling excrement at the walls, and I'm sure I cpuld outfit my house to serve that purpose quite well. And yet I somehow manage to resist the urge to invite excrement-flingers to my home.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin You've taken that out of context, it's not just this place does a better job, it's also that we do a good job of it, and the questions fit the scope and format of the site. It's like a zoo getting rid of it's monkeys because they behave like monkeys.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've also been saying recently that we do a good job of answering id requests and that there's nowhere better. No, a "good" job doesn't even begin to cover it--we do a heroic job of answering them, and our format and skill vastly surpasses any other venue. But I've also supported banning them for a fairly long time, because they just suck. They don't have to suck as much as they do--SF&F's story ident questions actually aren't that bad--but somehow the crowd we attract by having them is just full of lazy, entitled, illiterate people who are too lazy to correct "mocha" to "mecha".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think your metaphor--"a zoo getting rid of monkeys because they behave like monkeys"--is misplaced. The crappiness of id requests is a combination of immature people in our community and the qualities of the question type that make it attractive to those people. It's more like we have these monkeys (id requests) that behave like monkeys, and for that reason we need zoo visitors not to egg them on. Then a bunch of kids come in and start yelling and screaming and hooting and carrying on and making faces at the monkeys. We can do two things: kick out the kids, or get rid of the monkeys.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Except that in our case we can't kick out the kids, because more kids who behave the same way keep coming in. We can't stop them coming in. We can't keep kicking them out, because our zoo will get a bad reputation and people will stop coming. Our clientele is just not mature enough to have monkeys around. While it would really be nice if we could change our clientele and make them mature enough to handle monkeys, like the clientele over at that Science Fiction and Fantasy Zoo, it's not realistic. So we have to get rid of the monkeys, and replace them with some donkeys or something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli Well, let me put it another way. You would expect a zoo to have monkeys. You would expect a Anime & Manga Q&A site to be able to identify an anime or manga. Banning id-request isn't going to change that expectation, not if the people who ask these questions only ever post one question and never return. They'll never get the chance to learn differently. So these posts won't stop, they'll just be all closed now. Kids will still come to the zoo expecting to see monkeys. Maybe they'll spread the word that zoo doesn't have monkeys anymore, more likely they'll tell everyone that zoo sucks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli On the other hand, what makes this different from a monkey-less zoo is that while getting rid of monkeys makes room for something else, that's not the case here. This site is one of the smallest in the Stack Exchange network, there's already room for it to get a 1000 times bigger. Better questions won't be sucked into fill the vacuum left by the loss of the id-requests. This site will simply just shrink. The monkeys won't be replaced with donkeys, the monkey habitat will simply be left empty. Donkeys won't just wander in on their own.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The answer I just posted presents my thoughts on your first comment. In terms of the zoo metaphor: it takes a lot less energy to stop monkey-seeking kids at the gates and tell them "No monkeys, take a hike" than it does to let them in, let them start acting out, round them all up, and kick them out, then repeat the process several times a day every day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ʞɹɐzǝɹ presented some ideas to encourage more questions to fill in the gap. Yes, we might shrink. I'm not worried about it. If it's a choice between quality or quantity, I choose the former. Since we're not a beta anymore, it's unlikely that SE will shut us down, and several on the SE staff have an aversion to id requests anyway, so if anything they'll be happy that we've gotten rid of them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli Those ideas are orthogonal to banning id-requests. If they can actually get better questions they can get better questions regardless of whether id-requests are allowed. Your right that banning them will make it easier to police them. Though personally it doesn't seem too bad to me, not compared to what I see on Stack Overflow. However I don't really do any policing here, SO keeps me busy enough with that, so I'm not really in a position to judge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: the fact that ID requests fit the site, and that we answer them well. Low-effort "translation" ("what does this Chinese text mean") or reference ("how do I pronounce this word") questions are usually not allowed on language SE's, even though top users tend to be pretty good at answering those.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't do much moderation on Stack Overflow, but I too see a ton of really awful, vague, poorly written questions. What's shocking is that, proportional to our size, I see just as many here. None of the other smaller sites I frequent has that many bad questions. I argued in my answer that moderating all these bad questions takes away time that people might be using to ask and answer good questions, so banning id requests is *not* orthogonal to getting more good questions, because policing them takes away the time of potential good question writers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is the fact that we seem to be the place that identifies anime better of any importance here? We can still keep doing that in chat, and don't need to fill our front page with crap just because we seem to be the best community in the 'net doing it. Is it worth filling our site with low-quality questions, prone to be abandoned by the hit-and-run users who ask them, just because we appear to be able to do it better than anyone else? What benefit to they bring to the table? Do they help other users? Is anyone going to remember the same anime in the same way and find it through that...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont'd) same question? Are the users even sticking around to help us grow and to help others after they get their answer? Do they even care if we downvote and close their questions, and come back to edit and improve them? These put a great toll on our community, as part of it spends time and effort trying to help a single person, and not the community — in that sense, id-requests do _not_ fit well into our format: they may fit well into the Q&A format, but not into the SE philosphy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're better off motivating users to positively contribute to our community, so they earn enough rep to go to chat and ask about the anime they're looking for there — win-win situation: we can _still_ be the top place in the 'net to get your anime identified, and we rid our front page of this disease _while_ helping our community grow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Again, it's not just that one factor. It's the fact the questions are within the scope of "Anime and Manga", it's the fact that the questions fit the Stack Exchange Q/A format and it's the fact that we have a community of experts that are good at answering the questions. Normally when a whole class of questions are banned on a SE site one or more of these factors isn't true. When this happens despite all of them being true there should be a very good reason. I argue that in this case, while there is one good reason for getting rid of them anyways it's not quite sufficient.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Also, I don't think chat is going to be a substitute. If comments are Stack Exchange's second-class citizens, chat is its red-headed stepchild. It's not the same community, and it doesn't have the same vote/edit/close mechanisms to help moderate the "disease". Not that it matters, if people making id-requests never stick around as you suggest, not even to see their questions downvoted, closed and/or edited, then they're not going to stick around to see their questions closed now. They're never going to gain the reputation necessary to ask their question on chat instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You mention "the questions fit the Stack Exchange Q/A format" — I disagree with this statement. As I said before, they fit _a_ Q/A format, but if they fit _the Stack Exchange_ Q/A format, it's just barely. And I agree that your last sentence may end up being true: in fact, I might have said it myself, and added "and we don't lose much (if anything at all) from that."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge *"the fact that we have a community of experts that are good at answering the questions"* with other kinds of questions yes but with id requests the number of users who can produce high quality answers diminish considerably and most answers end up being one liners which look nothing short from a random guess. while they might answer the question in the end the answer is still crap and ends up being deleted because of a high number of downvotesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge *"if people making id-requests never stick around as you suggest, not even to see their questions downvoted, closed and/or edited, then they're not going to stick around to see their questions closed now. They're never going to gain the reputation necessary to ask their question on chat instead."* they can by asking/answering other kinds of questions. we're **Anime and Manga** not **Anime and Manga Identification Request**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X They can but they won't.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge which then brings us to what Krazer said in the question *"We're not here to be someone's personal search engine/concierge service, we're here to ask and answer questions about the world and culture of anime and manga."*. if a user comes here just to ask id request questions then they are just proving him right in thinking they are only using us as their personal search engine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with the idea that identification requests only help the asker. When answered, they sometimes make suprisingly good (as in serendipitous) anime / sci-fi / whatever recommendations. But of course that is entirely subjective.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pwassonne some people have felt the same but the problem remains when the questions and answers just bad and are taking away too much time from the community to fix. personally while i would love to discover new Shoujo Ai/Yuri titles through ID Requests but i feel that it's a disservice for them when we have a horrible id request for a hentai about a shouta having sex with multiple lolis says it's yuri when nothing they describe even hints at itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've never had the chance to answer an ID request (tried to once, but somehow my answer didn't send and by the time I realized, someone had answered. Turns out we had it right, too ^^) but if I did, I'd do my best to provide an objective description of what the media in question is like, or at least a description that completes what the identification request said. Like "what's this post apocalyptic anime where there's a robot that does this and that?" "it is ___, it's like your description because ___, and it's also rather graphic and has a deep message".


















Id requests suck, I've been convinced for quite a while that we should get rid of them, and I agree with ʞɹɐzǝɹ's plan to do so.

While there are many reasons they suck, and many reasons to get rid of them, I want to focus on one in particular--it takes way too much time and energy to police them. 

On a typical day, I visit the site four or five times. Each of those times, there's usually at least one new id request to look at (I view the site from the "All questions" tab, ordered from newest to oldest). It's usually written as one long sentence all in a single paragraph in shoddy English, with awful punctuation and incomprehensible word use. Sometimes this is because the asker is a non-native speaker of English, but sometimes the asker is a native speaker of English who is just too lazy or ignorant to put any effort into decent writing. I have no way to tell, so I have to go in and make paragraphs and use commas and fix typos to make it minimally presentable. I've also started cutting out all the useless fluff that people add to id requests—"Thanks in advance", "When I was young I saw this show I really liked", "Please excuse my poor English", "I'm going crazy trying to find this", "It was really cute", "It had great art", "I met my spouse because of this manga", etc. 

There's also been a rash of users recently who don't understand how tags work for some reason, so they just toss a bunch of random tags on their question instead of tagging it https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bleachbleach, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemonpokemon, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-balldragon-ball are all common but I just voted to close a question which had been wrongly tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/satisfaction-guaranteedsatisfaction-guaranteed. So those have to be changed. (Since so many of our questions are id requests, it boggles my mind that they didn't see another question tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request and figure out how they were supposed to do it. But id questioners do keep finding new, inventive ways to suck.)

Then the question is usually horribly vague, so I leave a comment asking the OP to add more information, like when they saw it, where they saw it, what exact year it was, etc. Typically I also downvote, and sometimes vote to close. Since I like to retract downvotes and close votes if it's justified, I come back later to check on it and see if the OP has done anything to improve the question. Very rarely is that the case. Usually the OP has posted some kind of whiny comment asking why everyone is complaining when that's really all they remember. Sometimes I try to explain to them why their question is bad, but it's usually a waste of time.

This process becomes draining, tedious, and frustrating after a while. I imagine it's also frustrating for the question asker. Also, the time I spend doing this is time I'm on the site, not asking or answering questions--in other words, not actually building up the site, but rather just trying to stop it collapsing under the weight of bad questions. Not making a better site, just trying to prevent it becoming a worse site.

I know it's not just me. I can see other users doing the same thing—users who once contributed great questions and answers, some of the best on the site, now spend all their time on the site sifting through garbage on the off chance of finding, not a diamond, but maybe an AA battery that isn't quite dead yet, or a jar that could make a good container for nuts and bolts and screws. I can see these users making the same edits, leaving the same comments asking for more information, voting to close, arguing with whiny questioners who expect service two hours ago, dammit, and an apology from the manager for the waiter's rudeness. 

It's just not worth all this trouble. Whatever value id requests add to the site—and, as we've discussed before, many of us believe they don't add much—that value is not worth all the time it takes to police them according to the strict, baroque guidelines we've set for them. Instead, we could have users out there writing better questions, or answering better questions. If we ban them, they'll keep showing up, and we'll still have to vote to close them, but just automatically casting a vote to close isn't nearly as draining, tedious, and frustrating as that entire process of trying to goad an unwilling OP into writing a decent question.

Just [downvote anything that looks remotely horrendous and move on, after having also casted a close vote](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/252740). What I propose we do instead is refine the close reasons and classify/clarify them better so that we don't have to explain in the comment everytime why the questions are being closed. If the id-asker still complains, they aren't welcome anyway, since they can't read.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao that's what we do on Stack Overflow. I don't want us to moderate our content like we do on Stack Overflow. We're not nearly at that scale to make it justified.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadaraUchiha But if we remove ids, aren't we also moderating content, a priori? We would piss people off either way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a big difference between saying "We, as a community, don't like those, and don't allow them anymore", and "We like them, but we'll downvote everything and never come back to them, to check for improvements"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the OP improves (hopefully) the post, it will enter the review queue anyway, so we will check them (hopefully). Just an observation: Arqade allows only ids with concrete screenshot. We disallow ids with concrete screenshot/images (except merchandise) and allow text-only ids. Interesting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao That's basically what we've been doing: "clarifying" our guidelines (i.e. making them more and more byzantine, with more and more exceptions, subheadings, and articles) and writing new meta posts every so often, stating the same guidelines in different ways, in the hopes that new users will see it. But people keep asking the same kind of questions and coming back with the defense "But that's all I remember!". I suspect many of them *do* read the guidelines, but because the guidelines are so complex and so subjective, they can't really tell if their question is okay, so they just post.


















I'm here to announce the first phase of the our clean up of "identification request", as detailed in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2806/63this proposal. Seeing that there have not been any noteworthy counter proposals, we're looking to move ahead with deprecating and eventually removing these questions from the site.

The cleanup will consist of three phases: deprecation, blacklisting, and removal. 

Here is a summary of the actions that will be taken in this first phase:


Phase 1:  Deprecation (Ongoing for the next 15 days, until May 23, 2016)
Modify the existing "minimum standard" off-topic reason Create a new close reason to say:


  Identification questions are off-topic (new and old), because they tend to attract low-quality and low-effort posts. The community has decided to no longer support these questions. Please refer to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2805/what-wed-like-to-do-about-those-gosh-darn-identification-requests-questionsthis meta post for additional details.


All "identification-request" question are now https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2805/what-wed-like-to-do-about-those-gosh-darn-identification-requests-questionsoff-topic and will no longer be accepted on this site. However, such question are still welcome http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-in our main chat for users with with at least https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/chat20 rep (globally on StackExchange).
Encourage all users with the close privilege to close all NEW https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions (those tagged and untagged). In other words, please do as you've been doing for the current "identification-request" questions, but now do them for all new, incoming "identification-requests." You may go around and close older identification request, but any unclosed "identification-request" questions from before this meta post will be taken cared of in Phase Two. 
Inform new users about the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/merchandisemerchandise, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cosplaycosplay, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/itashaitasha tags as needed. There will be a separate meta (to be updated) on guidelines of how to use these tags.


What's been updated?


The "identification-request" close reason /questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed
The on-topic https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp page /questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed
The https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourtour page /questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed
Added deprecation notice to the tag excerpt and wiki /questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed
The tooltip reminder for the "identification-request" tag /questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed


What's coming up:


Phase 2: Blacklisting (15 days from this post, starting May 23, 2016, note the length was shortened after receiving feedback from users)


Ask the CMs for assistance in closing all remaining "identification-requests" (that have not been closed), and apply a https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126587/what-is-a-historical-lock-and-what-is-it-used-forhistorical lock on ALL questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request (and tag synonyms, as needed) The tag will stay on the post, but it will not be editable by all users, except for moderators and CMs. 
When a tag is blacklisted, any and all post that have said tag will not be accepted. While editing is allowed on locked questions by the moderators, subsequent edits to post with the blacklisted tag will remove the tag from the question.



As always please let us know if you have questions or comment on the details or procedures made in this post.

I found quite a few old questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request that seem to not quite be questions of the type we're banning. For example, some questions asked for references used in a series:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4127/2604Who are these characters referenced in chapter 4 of Spotted Flower?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/18777/2604Was the names of the hot springs in ep8 of Gugure! Kokkuri-san a joke/reference to another anime?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21181/2604Which characters is the cast of Youkai Shoujo - Monsuga cosplaying as in the chapter 31 color cover?


Some of the cases where the tag was used for character identification:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/15376/2604Who are the three Homunculi that are with Irisviel and Saber?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/16681/2604Who is this person with four eyes in OP song?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/8437/2604Who is this in Fairy Tail?


(There were also some other cases, such as people wanted to identify an episode where something happened.) Would these be affected by the closure of all questions with the ID request tag (and if so, do we need to clean these up by removing the offending tag)?

Please remove the id-req tag from questions with series tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ʞɹɐzǝɹ Thanks, I'll take note of that. (The tagging, at least in the majority of these cases, was definitely not right to me, but I wasn't sure if something "automatic" in the clean-up process might spare us the tedium of going through questions to locate those with improper tagging and fixing them.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've gone through all of the questions I found where the ID request tag was used in conjunction with series tag. I'm still not sure what is to be done about [this question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/9544/2604), since it's asking for doujinshi identification, which is somewhat different, I think, from episode identification or the like. It's also still possible that I've missed a couple questions here and there, if only the [tag:identification-request] tag was used on them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your help, it's greatly appreciated.


















For those who want to start going though https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request and start closing all the question which are still opened i have a search query one can use to return all the questions which aren't closed.

[identification-request] closed:no is:question

so far the first 50 results i got also didn't show those that are on-hold so it should skip those which have been recently closed.

However, people are free to do so if they so choose to. Phase 2 is intended to do this in bulk so everyone doesn't have to do it manually, one by one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This does help with locating questions with improper tagging that we want to keep though, even if closing matters less.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note though that `is:question` isn't necessary: once I specify something like `closed:0` in the search, I only get questions.


















/questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed: tooltip rectified, and line about the tag on the sidebar removed.



I know this will probably be moot when the tag is blacklisted in about 2 weeks however when asking a question it still seems to imply we allow these questions

https://i.stack.imgur.com/SD5W0.png

My suggestions would be


with the "how to tag" remove the id request part
we can probably do away with the first paragraph of the popup if not the pop-up entirely since if users were reading the links in this we wouldn't have had so much crap. 

an alternative is to alter the first paragraph saying that the tag is depreciated and now off-topic, linking to the necessary meta, something along the lines of



  identification requests are https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2805/what-wed-like-to-do-about-those-gosh-darn-identification-requests-questions/2806#2806off-topic and are in the process of being removed.

As @Memor-X has mentioned https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2816/1530in the other meta, we need to adjust the wording of the tooltip on asking a question tagged as id-request.

Can we get it to be changed to:

The "How to tag" sidebar also mentions identification requests — that line should be removed.

We will be using an http://changingminds.org/disciplines/warfare/art_war/sun_tzu_annotated.htmannotated, free, and online version of the book.

What does this have to do with Anime and Manga?
All the major generals during the sengoku period studied the book (Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu). Any works featuring them could have mentioned the book.

So why a study group for the book?
Because its interesting, was written 1500 years ago, has influenced war, business, and anything requiring strategy. It still applies today, and the study group's aim is to see how it applies, and specifically, how it applies to the interests of the members of the study group.

Art of War study group will start when I've nailed down a time and a format.

TIME:
Since the current members are in the US, Europe, and Australia, a tentative time of Friday to Sunday, 6-9pm Houston time, which corresponds to 9am-noon  Sydney time, and midnight to 3am London time.

COMMUNICATION FORMAT:
Either AM.SE chat or Discord. Will consider other formats.

DISCUSSION FORMAT:
Round table discussion. Look at that week's phrase(s) and describe how it relates to something in your life or how it could apply to certain realistic situations. Anything to drive a discussion really. This is fluid and can change if we find something better to drive discussion. 

MEMBERS:


ton.yeung(myself)
armin
quill
krazer
jnat


SUBJECT TO CHANGE
Rather, expect changes as we get through a few discussions and members provide their opinions on what went well and what didn't.

Please let me know if you want to participate by posting here if the time and format is okay. I will post the time and the link to wherever the discussion will be held here.

The timeslot you mention would work for me. Do you have any particular weekend in mind?

Any of the proposed mediums would work well for me. Do you have a proposed format for the session itself? I mean, is it a sort of debate, or a lecture, or something else entirely? 'Cause depending on the format, one medium might be more suitable than another.

Look at that week's phrase(s) and describe how it relates to something in your life or how it could apply to certain realistic situations, but I'm open to anything that would drive discussion.


















Just my 2 Cents.

1 - This was a ridiculous small time frame. For a matter of this magnitude you should have allowed at least six months discussion

2 - ID requests are basically all I'm interested in answering on this site, since the rest of the questions seem of even lower quality, like questions about some boring stuff from Naruto, Bleach, One Piece or whatever kids watch these days.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you aren't aware, the ongoing discussion on id-req questions has been is a [long standing one](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=identification), spanning nearly three years, so having to go through it for another 6 months seems unreasonable to me. If you feel that the varieties of question on the site are "questions about some boring stuff from Naruto, Bleach, One Piece or whatever kids watch these days," please feel to leave some feedback on meta, so we can make an attempt to keep your interest. We can't help you if you don't speak up and tell us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5in regards to point 1 we had this meta post on the FEATURED ON META section in the question lists and pinned on chat not to mention it was at the top of the meta question list almost the entire time so 2 weeks to me seem enough time for anyone who could [participate in the meta](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/participate-in-meta) post their opinion. it wasn't like we hid it so no one could post their opinionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Two weeks maybe enough for people that visit regularly. Which seems fairly unnecessary seeing how few questions get asked anyway. I liked, for example, this question http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/34223/ but it got closed for dubious reasons.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just my two cents as well: comments like "like questions about some boring stuff from Naruto, Bleach, One Piece or whatever kids watch these days" doesn't seem to........how do I put it? What exactly makes a high quality question? Anyway, I totally agree that there needs to be some way of making sure questions are not the "Zomg, there was a pink haired girl who was she?" variety. Maybe there could be a monthly pizza/caffeine prize for "highest number of grammatical/sentence structure edits?"


















https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2812/63Continuing with our our cleanup of "identification request", as detailed in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2806/63this proposal.

Phase 2: Blacklisting (ongoing until June 6, 2016, note the length was shortened after receiving feedback from users)


/questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed Ask the CMs for assistance in closing all remaining "identification-requests" (that have not been closed), apply a https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126587/what-is-a-historical-lock-and-what-is-it-used-forhistorical lock on ALL questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request (and tag synonyms, as needed) (this has been moved to Phase 3) , and blacklist the tag.

When a tag is blacklisted, any and all post that have said tag will not be accepted. While editing is allowed on locked questions by the moderators, subsequent edits to post with the blacklisted tag will remove the tag from the question.
For those with the delete privilege, please start voting to deleting incoming posts that are identification question but are not tagged as such. For those who cannot vote to delete, please flag these post.



Phase 3: Deletion (starting June 6, 2016, note the length was shortened after receiving feedback from users)


Ask the CMs for assistance to delete all "identification-requests" without a question score of 4 or higher AND at least answer with score of 3 or higher.
Ask the CMs to apply a https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126587/what-is-a-historical-lock-and-what-is-it-used-forhistorical lock on ALL questions tagged with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request (and tag synonyms, as needed). Moved from Phase 2.


As always please let us know if you have questions or comment on the details or procedures made in this post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Identification Request Cleanup: Phase 2 - Blacklistingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That blacklisting effort couldn't come any sooner.  There are quite a few more identification requests just popping out of the ether.


















Request: I would like to request the CMs blacklist the "identification-request" tag, close the remaining open questions tagged with it and apply an historical lock on all questions tagged with this tag.

Reasoning: As vetted by this https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2805/what-wed-like-to-do-about-those-gosh-darn-identification-requests-questionsmeta discussion, we've decided to start deprecating and removing identification question from our site. As part of Phase 2, we would like to blacklist the tag to prevent it from being used in the future. We would like to lock all current identification question as a further reminder to users that, while theses question were acceptable in the past, they are no longer welcome on our site. (Moved to Phase 3.)



The Background: Breaking these changes into three phases is intended to gradually ease all users into what can be considered a very drastic change to the landscape of our community. The "identification-request" tag used to be our most popular tag, but due to a long history of low quality and neglected questions (and answers), support (and favor) for the tag has waned drastically. 


Phase 1 was intended as a reminder to users that we're going to stop support the tag and to please stop asking these questions. Closing new identification requests was indented to deter and starting reducing the number of identification question coming in.
Phase 2 is intended to be a direct roadblock indicating to new users that they can no longer use the tag. Locking the question, as indicated prior, is intended to warn users stumbling into an old identification question that these questions are no longer on topic and that they should stop asking.
Phase 3 is intented to be cleanup. While we have a lot of identification questions, many of them are of low quality, abandoned, or otherwise unanswerable. While we are getting rid of these questions, we'd still like to leave a few examples of good identification question, as a legacy of sorts. There will be a /questions/tagged/feature-requestfeature-request for this at a later time. 

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please blacklist the "identification-request" tag and lock all question with the aforementioned tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is intended to really put the process in the fast lane, right?  I'd have thought that the other Meta post made our intents *very clear*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. Each step is intended to up the ante as most user to frequent or know about meta, we need to be explicit with them on matters such as this. This feature request is more of a formality to keep in line with prior precedence.


















I tested the blacklisting in the mobile site and got this warning.

As I wrote https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2827/2604in another meta post, the warning that appears on the mobile website, when the now-blacklisted https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag is used, does not display properly. The HTML for the link to the meta post about our new policy is interpreted as the text to display. This was not a problem when I went on the mobile site for Math.SE and tried using the blacklisted https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homeworkhomework tag; the link to the relevant meta post was displayed properly.

 https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rcBL.png

I also tried Judaism.SE (where https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/torahtorah cannot be used), and the links in the custom warning looked fine, but those were to other tags that the user might want to use, rather than site posts.

We've fixed this box on Anime so that it uses Markdown too, so it should be displayed properly now. I won't mark this as completed though, 'cause the actual underlying bug (the sites not using the same route) is not fixed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat: thanks. I take it that this was also a problem on the full site then?


















Update:
Since the reaction to this idea seemed pretty lukewarm, I've decided not to move ahead with this. If someone else wants to build an event on this idea, feel free to do so.



This is a conspiracy to get some good questions and answers in less-trafficked tags. 

If the response to this proposal seems positive, I'll move ahead with implementation in a week or so.

Proposal

We should form viewing circles—groups of users who are all following the same series at the same time. Hopefully, this will mean that when people ask questions about the series, other users who are also following the series will be able to answer them. The circle doesn't have to stay in lockstep; it's okay if you slip back by a few episodes, and it's also okay if you end up way ahead. 

This proposal comes from several frustrating experiences I've had. The https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/narutonaruto and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/one-pieceone-piece tags never seem to lack for questions or answers, but it's a real crapshoot in other tags, especially when it comes to currently airing or less popular shows. If you ask a question about a show that no one else is following, you either get no answers or you get overly general answers from people who haven't seen the show and are guessing based on tropes. Conversely, a lot of people won't even look at a question if it concerns a series they aren't following. So decent posts languish with few upvotes, and the users who write these posts get discouraged and seem to either give up and leave or spend a bunch of time in the review queues closing id requests. It's just a bad experience all around. While this is somewhat unavoidable, there's a lot we can do to improve it, and this proposal is one idea I came up with to do so.

Also, a lot of people mentioned that they discovered new series by reading id requests. Now that id requests are gone, this could be a good way to discover something new.

Process

If this idea hits off, we can do it maybe once per season. You can also do manga; I don't think we really need to separate out manga.

Here's how we can form circles:


Someone (probably me) will create a meta post to form circles.
Everyone should write answers mentioning the series you want to form a circle around. It can be a single series, or it can be a franchise (e.g. all the Fate shows), or a small set of shows around some kind of theme (e.g. shows inspired by Eva, shows based on Key visual novels, manga by Shirow Masamune, the films of Satoshi Kon). If you're doing multiple shows, you should mention the viewing order you'd like to follow so things can stay in synch. It would also be nice to mention where someone can watch the series (legally, of course), and whether it's been completely released or is currently simulcasting.
We should all upvote answers that mention series we're interested in following.
You can commit to a circle by leaving a comment saying "I'm committing to this circle". It's not official, but it's nice for the person who created the circle to know that others are interested in committing. You can also make suggestions or request clarification before committing.
People are inevitably going to drop out as life happens (or as the show starts to suck), so large groups are probably better. I would encourage everyone to commit to popular, highly upvoted circles so the circle can survive these inevitable dropouts.
For the same reason, we should all join several circles, not just one or two. That way if you can't stand to watch a show anymore, you can drop it, but still be involved with other circles.
It's completely valid to join a circle watching a series you've already seen, if you'd like to rewatch it and maybe answer some newbie questions with your deeper perspective on the series. You can also possibly join a circle if you've seen the series and aren't going to rewatch it, just to assure everyone that there are experts on that series around the site.
It's also perfectly okay to "join" a circle long after it's been formed and started watching the series—you know that other users on the site have seen the show, so you can ask questions with some confidence that there are experts around. And there might also be questions from the initial viewing still hanging around without good answers, that you can provide an answer for.


I prefer to do this on Meta rather than chat. Not all of us go to chat, and not everyone who might be interested in a circle is going to be on chat at the same time. Plus, doing it on Meta lets interested people vet the suggested circles to make sure someone else is actually interested in joining. 

Please leave comments, questions, and suggestions here. If people seem interested, I'll create another post where we can actually form circles.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Proposal: Let's form viewing circles!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't mind the circle organization happening on meta, but for discussion chat really is a better platform - plus you can organize 'events' for a particular time, create dedicated rooms with a nicher focus (unlike the main room where a lot of discussion may happen in a day).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ToshinouKyouko I'd prefer if people can participate in a circle without being required to go to chat. If some circles want to agree on doing certain things in chat, like weekly discussions to help generate questions, that's fine, but my goal is to bulk up the main site, so I hope that circles will use the main site as a platform and not get all their good ideas out in chat. (Plus, I'm biased—I don't go to chat. If this system takes off, I might change that, though.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey downvoters, how about taking five minutes to let me know what exactly you found objectionable about this idea? That way, maybe we can talk about how to fix it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli That took way more than five minutes...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao Well, your answer was too thoughtful. Stop all that thinking, it takes too long! (I appreciate you taking the time :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli It didn't take too long, but I was having trouble turning what was just a hunch into words. Don't know if it makes sense or is at all precise, but there you go.


















In addition to circles, I would like to propose a mutual contract (with possible bounty) system. Which basically is an agreement, by two (or more) users, where one party (the contractor) picks an anime of their choosing that they want someone else (the contracted) to watch, and the other party (the contractor) agrees to watch in exchange they watch an anime of their (the contracted) choosing. 

The two parties may set some conditions, like the minimum number of episodes/seasons, how long they have to finish it and what they need to do in order to establish that they've finished a series. Typically, these contracts should follow the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Rep bounties may be offered as compensation. Additionally, you may ask the other party to ask (and self-answer) a question for additional bounty (inspired by @senshin previous bounties for tags event).

You can fulfill these contracts on your own or as a group. I will offer to stream any series available on Crunchyroll or Funimation via Rabb.it (no region restrictions) for any individuals and circles, as long as they set a schedule ahead of time. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is an excellent idea. With this you can join a circle casually if you want, but if you're really serious about it, you can also make a contract. And contracting someone could also be a great way to get yourself to try watching something you might not have looked at otherwise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Per @ToshinouKyouko's comment about using chat for discussion, I think a good way to organize contracts would be for a contractor to propose a contract in the Meta post, then interested people can leave a comment on the post suggesting a "price" for taking the contract. The contractor and contracted can go to chat to work out the details, and then come back and edit the meta post to indicate the contract has been taken and include the terms (episodes/season, timeframe, offered bounties and any terms on the bounty award).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think bountys would be a good fit for it. Dont forget reputation is a [token economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_economy). This would make it seem as a currency, and as [shog9](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/130728/259147) mentions 'Reputation is not a currency. Any attempt to make it into one will be met with severe opposition.'


















We've blacklisted the tag, preventing getting the badge for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request but if the tag is still your closest tag to receiving a badge the system will still suggest it as the recommended.

(And blacklists are regex-based=b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@braiam I don't really care about the technical implementation or how they have to fix it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You may not, but if you want it to be implemented the developer needs to know what the heck is going on, [as they may sometimes don't even remember how stuff works](http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/89?m=4951731#4951731)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If a tag is so bad that it was blacklisted, what's the benefit of keeping it? And if the existing questions are worth keeping, why is the tag blacklisted? Removing the tag sounds like the way to go here rather than complicating the progress tracker.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Adam some id request questions and answers were good quality ones netting the posters a good deal of rep and ideally we would have wanted all I'd request to be like that. however the tag was blacklisted because too many users don't put in any effort into their I'd request questions so as apart of the process to make them off-topic the tag was black listed and low quality questions were deleted while high quality ones where kept and historically locked, preserving some of the hard work people put into themb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5also with the blacklisting we are able to prevent people from using it and presenting them with a message leading them to the meta discussion on the topic showing why we no longer accept them. not that it makes any difference to some who saw it was blacklisted and still posted their question apologising for not using the right tags because of the black listb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Adam I can't imagine that having a tag recommended to users which is impossible to obtain was a design decision, so why is the bug tag removed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MichaelMcQuade Feature request to change existing behavior seems enough to me. There's several badges that are impossible to obtain (eg beta). Tag badges aren't particular special in that sense. If you feel strongly, you're free to revert my edit, but I do feel this is more of a feature change than a bug report.


















Re: Proposal

I share your sentiment, but by forming viewing circles, this only increases the chance of the followed series getting more timely answers and votes to questions asked around the time the viewing circles are watching them, which may draw in more traffic and interest to the main site if they are currently airing shows. I don't know if it would encourage people to ask more questions about less popular shows, though.

Personally, before I start watching any completed series, I try to search the main site by tag name and see what questions there are and remind myself to look for/record the answers when viewing so I could go back and give my input when I am done with the series. This way, I can provide more complete answers and also spot and possibly correct the posts that seriously spoil the content without warning (I don't mind spoilers most of the time). And of course I also vote on the questions and answers, if any.

Re: Process

How do you co-ordinate this efficiently? And if you encourage people to commit to large, popular circles, how would it be different from the status quo? If it's informal and the purpose is just to have fun, then sure it doesn't matter. If that's the case, I would still prefer it to be an event attached to a chatroom because as a certain Tomato said, chat is a somewhat better platform for this purpose.

Positive aspects

I think your proposal is workable if it's only restricted to currently airing shows. Otherwise you have too many options for less impact. We should arrange the viewing sessions at the earliest time possible: as close to the release time of the latest episode as possible.

For less popular, non-airing shows, I think bounty offers is still the best method to attract answers. If we continue what senshin did, grouping each bounty offer by theme (e.g. Studio Ghibli's films), it will also serve the purpose of introducing anime to members who could filter by genre/theme if they so choose, and these anime grouped by themes might also require the same/similar area of expertise to come up with questions/answers, and having seen one might benefit knowledge of another.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for a thoughtful answer. Here's how I would respond: 1) The status quo is Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, DBZ, and formerly id requests. We used to at least get questions about shows like Madoka, Fate/Zero, and Bakemonogatari, which are popular, but nowhere near the level of Naruto. Because of IRL circumstances, I haven't watched much anime for the past six or seven months, so I don't even know what's popular with the otaku crowd now (Konosuba?), but whatever it is, if we can get more questions on it, I consider that an improvement. Doesn't have to be enough to rival Naruto, just _more_.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e52) I was purposely being vague about how to organize circles because it's a pretty big thing for people with lives to commit twelve weeks to watching a show and writing posts on it. I wanted to keep circle organization flexible and circumstantial. But I did like ʞɹɐzǝɹ's idea as a sort of premium-level for really committed people.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53) I was hoping that circles asking and answering questions about a show would be like a series of repeated shots in the arm, rather than a single long-term cure. Part of the reason Naruto and One Piece have so many questions is that they just keep going and going, so mini communities coalesce around them. With shorter shows, you don't really have that effect because they're over quickly. I was hoping to fake that mini community effect several times over several shorter shows.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e54) A lot of us in the 3k–7k rep range who aren't into the Big Four shows seem to kind of drop out of the site after a while and spend all our time in the review queues. I know that I personally start to feel like it's futile to ask any questions, because no one else is watching what I'm watching. I could self-answer but if that's all I ever do, I might as well just be writing on my blog. My hope was that this proposal would reengage some of those users with Q&A, which is also why I didn't want the whole thing taking place in chat.

Looking at the http://ultradragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Eternal_Super_Saiyanfirst link on Eternal Super Seiyan, at the bottom in the categories it says

It appears that https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fan-fictionfan-fiction questions are https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/251/are-fan-fics-fair-game-for-this-siteon-topic on SciFi.SE, which suggests that they are workable on SciFi, but I am wondering if fan fiction/fanon questions should be on or off topic here on Anime.SE?, and if they are on-topic, how should they be quality controlled? (i.e. tags, guidelines, etc)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are fanfiction/fanon questions on or off topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5if we decide to use a tag for these questions, I suggest "fan-fiction" and synonimizing with "fan" and "fanfiction"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this different than allowing doujinshi, which is also a fan fiction in a sense? Unrelated to that, I remember I answered a fan theory related to DB, which seemed to be accepted by community: http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/26363/2516b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka Wikipedia defines doujinshi as a *"Japanese term for self-published works, usually magazines, manga or novels."* which in a way any story on fanfiction.net is a form of self-publication as an indie posting they game on any side then considers that game as "shipped". but that being said i'm kinda hesitant to group the 2 together as while there are fan made doujinshi of say Madoka which don't follow canon (ie. Mami meeting with that office lady and the 2 fall in love) there is unique dojinshi like Virgin's Empire and Type-Moon first started off as a doujin circleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka also in regards to the question you answered that was asking what the canon souce may be for something used in the fandom. it would be like asking *"In a lot of Fanfiction it shows that Nanoha Takamachi can absolutely demolish an enemy yet they instantly fall in love with her afterwards. what is the source to that"* to which we point out that in the Nanoha series people who Nanoha has attack normally changes side, such as Arisa stopped bullying Suzuka when Nanoha slapped her and became best of friend with them and Fate being Nanoha's arch enemy until a Starlight Breaker to the face


















I think fanfiction is on topic. Fanfictions provide a story on their own. They have simply a label slabbed on them. If they hadn't these labels, they would be accepted without discussion. We should see them as extension of the normal canon.1 But each fanfiction series is unrelated to other series.

The fear of poor quality questions are without reason, in my opinion, because they won't cause more bad quality question than other stories that are not finished or have lots of loose ends.

If we don't have enough information to answer a question because it was never mentioned in the story or by the author then the only answer is 


  We don't know.


But I think it should be made clear, that the question is about non-canon material. This can be done, either by a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fanfictionfanfiction tag or by specific tags for a fanfiction (because I barely read fanfiction, I take a normal scifi fanfic) https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/the-adventures-of-harriet-potterthe-adventures-of-harriet-potter.

I think we should take both, because the first tag can be used to ask for fanfictions in general, e.g. 


  Are there any fanfictions that describe the life of C.C.?


This question could be tagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-geasscode-geass https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fanfictionfanfiction.

Whether this question is on or off topic is a different discussion that can be had when this one is done.

TL;DR: Fanfiction is on topic.

1 I had the misconception that all fanfic is in accordance to canon, which is obviously not the case (how can gender swap be canon?) So a fanfic has its own canon.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW I don't read fanfiction remotely seriously, but I've seen cases where their content clearly works _against_ the "normal" canon (e.g. because of pervasive misconceptions among fans).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"If they hadn't these labels, they would be accepted without discussion." This feels questionable to me, in the context of this specific site. If I wrote a story "in itself" about a character identical to _Aku no Hana_'s Nakamura, without the "fanfiction" label, my friends would probably treat it as a serious short-story. Particularly in light of the fact that I have no link to Japan, there would thus be no obvious reason to include questions about such a story here, IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon To your first point, on Sci-Fi & Fantasy, fan-fiction is on-topic, but they typically treat it as a separate continuity (e.g. they don't answer questions about Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality from within the Harry Potter book canon).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A different facet of @Maroon's second point: I've written some original novels that were heavily influenced by anime, but not fan-fiction. I'm not Japanese, so my books aren't real light novels. On the other hand, the creators of Avatar: The Last Airbender are no more Japanese than I am. Should their pseudo-anime be on-topic and mine not?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By the way, I have some heavy reservations about making fanfics on-topic here, but if we do, I definitely think we should ban questions like "Are there any fanfictions that describe the life of C.C.?"—that's basically a recommendation question. If I came here saying "Are there any anime that take place in British Columbia?" I'm fairly sure it would be closed, and deservedly so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli to the third point: I already said that that is a different discussion that we must have of we decide to allow fanfic questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli to your second point: avatar is on topic, so, as long as it imitates the style of an accepted format it is OK? I don't know what the community consensus is regarding that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Evilloli to your first point: I made an edit to my proposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon evilloli addresses your second point and I addressed your first point with an edit in my proposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[This thing](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/2535/7579) I did a while ago summarizes our current policy on stuff that's not anime or manga, but I was basically trying to show that Maroon's second point is extremely subtle.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Armin in regards to series like Avatar and RWBY we seem to decide these on a case by case basis since The Boondocks (which appears to have some Afro Samurai inspired scenes in it along with the art style) and the original Powerpuff Girls would be off-topic hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X Powerpuff girls is the only one I know and I wouldn't have said that it would be an anime...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Armin true however i have read in places people compare powerpuff girls to anime because the characters have "buggy anime eyes" and at times the way Mojo Jojo speaks is compare to that of Asian forced english (the broken kind of english you sometimes see coming from Asian characters in movies who are portrayed in not understanding the US way of life)


















For verification and archival purpose, I have compiled https://gist.github.com/nhahtdh/108f8a930f219f05799bd84d86c43661the list of questions to be deleted with post ID, title and score, based on the conditions above.

The list above is generated from https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/497973this query, which will stop working next week, when Data Explorer is refreshed with a new dump.

select p.id as [Post Link], p.title, p.answercount, p.score, q.score
from posts p left join (
  select a.parentid, max(a.score) as score
  from posts a
  where a.posttypeid = 2
  group by a.parentid
) q on p.id = q.parentid
where p.tags like '%<identification-request>%'
and (p.score < 4 or q.score < 3 or q.score is null)


After fixing a derp in my query, the number of questions to be removed (1638) now more or less matches the number from JNat's post (1637), with the exception of one post which has been removed earlier by Oded. The one exception aside, I have confirmed that both delete lists contain the same questions.

https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/497978The number of remaining questions (396) matches https://anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=[identification-request]+is%3Aqthe number currently on the site, so there seems to be no hiccup in the process. For extra precaution, I have compared and confirmed that the list of questions from Data Explorer matches the list from JNat's post.

Note that the remaining questions cannot be accessed via https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request when they are locked. Hopefully, the tag is still recorded in the question, so that https://anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=[identification-request]+is%3Aqthe search query still works.

Those should be deleted _by the community_ as they come in, much like they're being closed.


















I would say that questions about fan-fictions are off-topic.

There are a few reasons why I say this:


People can say whatever they want in a fan-fiction, and sometimes
they aren't even related to the original anime or manga themselves.
Often, the answers to fan-fiction questions are, "We don't know!"
Fan-fiction questions can tend to be open-ended due to either bad storytelling or bad links to the original anime or manga, and it is stated in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askhelp center that:



  Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.



Which leads me to: they distract from questions about actual anime and manga. And anime and manga are the whole spirit of this site!


To wrap up, I don't think the users on this site are entitled to answer questions about fictions of varying quality levels. That can get way off-topic, and it would create a whole slew of second-rate questions that people don't want to have getting in the way of legitimate, valuable posts.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I share some of these reservations, but FWIW we do currently accept questions about doujinshi, which _can_ fall into "fanfiction" (and I don't feel like contesting that policy at all).


















Just last weekend Animecon was held in the World Forum - the same venue that has previously hosted such events as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_ContestEuroVision Song Contest.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/O03jP.jpg 

As we previously organised, a couple of our EU members (including myself) attended and met up. Unfortunately, a combination of an overly long leadup time and a short reminder period probably made it difficult for others to show up (my bad).

Here's some of us outside the venue!

https://i.stack.imgur.com/F5Ssum.jpg

( Myself, @DimitriMx & his girlfriend cosplaying as Ratman & GLaDOS, @Alagaros and "Big Boss" ) - Dimitri & Alagaros need to convince them to join us >:)

We bumped into a few more of their friends but they missed out on this photo.

The con's theme this year was "All aboard" so there was a lot of naval events - especially around the Kancolle girls, poi.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/3794em.jpg 


   yes, she's not an original ship, it's a Lucky Star crossover


I was going to cosplay as a tomato, but the costume had no pockets and bags were restricted in certain areas of the con so I decided against it. But I went red anyway as I got sunburnt the day before from visiting the nearby beach.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3Uqc.jpg

Unfortunately, there was a small hitch when we first met - for we agreed to meet at the maid cafe - But there were TWO! and of course, I went to the wrong one...

The dealers room was huge and I think most of us came away with something to bring home. There were also a lot of figure displays on show to make us jealous.

In the evening http://www.animecon.nl/program/events/fripside/fripsideFripside - famous for the OP of To Aru Kagaku no Railgun - performed, although they were unfortunately late so we didn't catch the whole show. There were some cosplay performances on the big stage at other times during the day which were very impressive too, although we didn't watch them together.

For lunch we got some pizza, Dimitri and his friends headed earlier and got some for free for his friend being the first pikachu cosplay to arrive!
No such luck for myself, Alagaros and Big Boss - but we did get some delicious pizza nonetheless.

Unfortunately the swag arrived a day too late, but to make up for the fact I'll hand out some bounties here and there :)

https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbBGnm.jpg

I think it was a pretty successful trip, it was nice to meet everybody and it was fun to do some stuff together. Maybe this meta will inspire the next A&M meetup somewhere else in the globe!

I couldn't make it in the end due to starting my summer work placement around the same time which complicated things at my end, which is a shame since I'm a fan of Kancolle and it would have been a great time to try out my Kaga cosplay :L
I'll make sure to look out for next years meetup!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sound quite exciting and fun filled.


















There's an /questions/tagged/eventsevents tag and a /questions/tagged/community-eventscommunity-events tag on meta. 

it's about a 14-17 split.

Are these being used for the same purpose? can we/I merge these tags?

Unless there are any objections, I will make /questions/tagged/eventsevents the main tag with community-events as a synonym - as it is shorter and more obvious.

I believe we need to deprecate this tag, as like in the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2427/should-we-allow-genre-meta-tags?lq=1question you linked - it's too general to be of much use.

Currently we have a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2690/policy-review-tagging-separate-continuitiespolicy to split up larger series into appropiate subseries, but live-action versions are potentially too niche.

There are two questions there that do not have a 'master' series tag though, I propose that we have a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/live-action-productionlive-action-production tag similar to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/manga-productionmanga-production to discuss specific questions.

There is a similar policy with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-historyanime-history, in which there is a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/light-novel-historylight-novel-history post which is also specific.

I have been advocating getting rid of any 'future news' questions for a while now - and while it has recieved positive feedback, it only seems to be half implemented - even when my answer was accepted. It was also one of the top areas to clarify in our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2564/lets-take-a-look-back-at-our-site-policies-2015-edition/26722015 feedback session

If we go back to the first post out of all of this, @GraceNote makes a good point:


  "what is to happen in the future" is something that should be kept off-topic


Jnat implemented the closure reason back in 2013:

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/626/what-should-be-our-custom-off-topic-close-reasons/664#664What should be our custom off-topic close reasons?

But it was edited in the post to be changed from unannounced to all. However, That change didn't make it the whole way through to the actual close reasons - and all the other meta posts.



I realise that some questions are interesting to people, but just like ID requests, the ratio is pretty bad for good:bad questions.

Therefore I propose (for hopefully the last time) that we can change the closure reason to cover all news events that have not already taken place.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5so when you say *"all news events that have not already taken place."* even if it was reported in a manga issue that, for example, the Bleach Anime was starting again, unless the anime actually has started any questions asking about it will be off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X yes, reviewers essentially have to answer the question themselves to know if it's on-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I maintain the position I put forth in [this comment](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/2564/#comment4982_2573). There are many bad questions of this sort, to be sure, but not nearly enough to warrant blanket-banning them on they're-killing-the-site grounds. I prefer a charitable approach here, in which we permit these questions to stay unless there is either 1.) evidence that they are unanswerable or 2.) a lack of evidence that they are answerable (as indicated by going a reasonable amount of time without being answered).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By the way, there is one more related discussion: http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2421


















When we originally decided to allow questions about future events with regard to anime/manga production*, the onus was on the asker to demonstrate that an announcement has been made, at which point it is reasonable to ask questions specifically within the context of that announcement. In practice the vast majority of questions about future events are not of this form. However, if (for example) someone linked an announcement of the http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-05-05/nisioisin-zaregoto-novels-launch-anime-project/.101810Zaregoto adaptation and wanted to ask whether only the original is getting adapted or also parts of the spin-off work Ningen, it would not make sense to close that question. Even if we can't answer it now (and I'm not sure whether we can), at some point we'll surely be able to. Most questions of this form will still be at least slightly interesting after the work has been produced.

If an announcement has been made but the asker is not aware of the announcement and coincidentally asks an answerable question, it's fair to close it anyway. Close voters aren't expected to know whether announcements have been made. Almost any "Will X get an anime adaptation" question falls in this category, even if the answer is already known. Of course, if an announcement has been made that the OP is not aware of, but it can be edited in to the question in a way that doesn't trivialize the question, that improvement would be grounds for not closing or reopening. This won't save the common "Will X get an anime adaptation?" questions, as they're trivialized by the announcement. So if someone asks "Will there be another season of SAO?" it's fine to close that question even if you know that a third season has been announced.

So, to put it briefly, allowing questions about announced future events is not supposed to allow questions where the asker happens to get lucky and an announcement has been made. It's supposed to allow questions asked within the context of an already-public announcement. That is to say, you can ask about the news, but you can't ask looking for news, as we aren't a news site. In practice such questions are rare, and the burden of proof of an announcement lies with the asker, not close voters.



*Note that in-universe questions about future events are completely allowed, as we can just wait and answer them when they are eventually answered in-universe (either explicitly or by lack of an answer at the conclusion of the work). The problem with production questions is that the vast majority of the information is not public knowledge. So we can never rule out, say, another TV season of Ranma 1/2 or Slam Dunk, even though it seems quite unlikely. In the rare cases where there is publicly available information (in the form of an announcement), it makes sense to allow questions about that information, but in the absence of any evidence to the contrary we can only assume that any information about such is private.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like this proposal as an intermediate between the other ideas :)


















I am of the opinion that these particular questions are indeed on-topic; they eliminate a lot of the issues that we originally had with identification requests by being explicit and very narrow in scope.

However, I also believe that they make for poorer questions (and answers) in general.  It may be nice to figure out what the name of some BGM is playing in the background so you can purchase it later, and it may be nice to have some closure on where a scene from an episode came from.  However, I personally don't feel satisfied when I see https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/33977/102a similar pattern of answer as we did https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/21211/102with original identification requests.  This may be worth a separate discussion, but for now, identifications for music and scenes is on-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, they're not great questions; in fact, I downvote many of them.  But I support leaving them alone for now. If they become the plague that regular id requests were, we can talk about it.


















Recent examples are https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/34353/rezero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsuhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/34353/rezero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/34330/in-the-erased-manga-do-satoru-and-airi-get-togetherIn the Erased manga do Satoru and Airi get together?, and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/34196/why-does-ash-walk-away-from-the-starting-pokemonDoes Ash walk away from the starting pokemon in the anime?. 

The common thread among these questions is that the OP is familiar with one form of a story (the anime, the game) and is asking questions about what happened in some other version (the manga, the anime) which are obvious to someone who's actually read/watched that other version.

We seem to be entering a bit of a close/reopen war on these. I keep going back and forth; in my opinion, they're not good questions, but I'm also not sure they should be closed. Downvoted, yes, but I don't know about closing.

Anyone have an opinion on this? Should we allow these in general? Should there be any criteria to decide which ones are too silly to allow?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we close questions that ask us to summarize something the OP hasn't watched?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To me, the worst cases (e.g. the Re:Zero example) tend to fall into the category of "uninteresting questions without much value to others that could easily have been researched." (For comparison, it would also contain something like [this Code Geass question](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/13270/2604).) Downvoting seems somehow more appropriate than a VTC though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also imagine there are _good_ instances of such questions. (For instance, if only one adaptation of the content has been localized and licensed and the OP has already seen one version and has a fairly specific question, or if locating the relevant chapters in a very long-running series is difficult.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon That was my thought too. For instance, I asked a question about the Yuru Yuri manga that was similar to these ones.


















Re zero is just too silly to even consider as a valid question, so let's not mix it in together with the other two.



Regarding Erased question…

There are cases where you can get an answer relatively easily, like (in my opinion) in case of this Erased question, by just browsing the manga's last pages and seeing how it diverges from anime. But these are just 2 versions, so as I see it, OP didn't bother to look it up, and so I downvoted the question for lack of research. 

And then there are not so easy to answer questions like works with multiple continuities, different twists on the same story, alternative setting, etc. For example, Ghost in the Shell which has many movies and series.

I don't think it should stay closed, as it's a valid, even if not a very good question of its kind.



Regarding Pokemon question…

OP says:


  I've not seen the show, but I used to play the video games.


It is not stated which games, but I've played Yellow and https://youtu.be/2q32b5XoecQ?t=89you just don't get the pokemon you were supposed to get because your rival is mean, and it's within the first few minutes. But I assume that OP wasn't playing Yellow, and the newer games do give you some choice of a starter pokemon (haven't played any myself).

But that's not why it was closed. Because it was put in a way that it asks about the Pokemon Go game, it's not on topic here. The answer was given to a very related, but not the same question. I think we can fix this case by editing the question to "How does Ash get Pikachu in the anime?" and then it would be on topic.

update: I edited the Pokemon question to be on topic.

I've also voted to reopen the Erased question; it's not a great question, and I can certainly see how it would earn a downvote, but I don't find it close-worthy. I also agree with you that the Re:Zero question was silly and too forum-like (also, the OP can just wait until next week).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5in regards to the Pokemon games, to my knowledge (which is up to the Gem before Black and White) Pokemon Yellow is the only game (excluding spinoffs like Ranger) in which you don't *choose* a starter pokemon, in fact it more mirrored the anime as your Pikachu doesn't go back into it's ball, follows behind you and actually had proper line in comparison to the weird tones all the other pokemon do in every other game. it also had affection which if it got too low would act like a high lv traded pokemon that your missing badges for


















In response to the latest edit:


  Should we allow these in general? Should there be any criteria to decide which ones are too silly to allow?


I think there should be some quality threshold to avoid having to answer and keep questions like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/34454/is-there-any-romance-in-absolute-duo-do-people-end-up-togetherthis one. For example, if answer can be found on:


Wikipedia or anime database page for the work;
First page of a google search (somebody already asked this on forums or answered in reviews);
The thing in question is made pretty obvious at the beginning or the end (which are both easy to locate), except where that something is implied and you think some viewers could miss it (which is probably evidence they didn't pay enough attention, and so they're being lazy by asking such a question).


If answer can't be found like that, I think it's reasonable to say it's not easy to find it, and it deserves a place on the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i think that this is a pretty hard summary for moderators to maintain. you have to check some knowledge sites (wikis, dbs), check google results and have to watch the beginning and the end of the episode/anime. that's a lot of work for a moderator to do before you can decide whether it should be off topic or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with having a quality threshold, but I also agree with @Armin that I don't like the idea of having to do research to figure out if a question is on-topic (like we did with image-only id requests).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, the question you linked is horrible, but I think its main problem is that it's primarily opinion-based since it depends on someone's definition of "real romance". I voted to close on that basis.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe we could treat these criteria as an upper-bound: if a question falls under these criteria, it is definitely off-topic, but close voters can also apply some judgment to decide if the given question is likely to fall under these criteria, and anyone who disagrees with the closure can do the research and start a reopen vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Basically, if it's worth a downvote, you probably already know it's easy to google it up, but just to be technically correct and precise and be able to back up with written rules, this is what I've come up with. When in doubt, ask yourself if a question is what you think this site is about and if you expect it to be part of the site's main focus. Remember that your vote may express your personal opinion in addition to indicating "research, usefulness and clarity" (as explained in hover text of vote buttons).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Linked question has been removed.


















What is the purpose of this website? I can't exactly think of a specific purpose. Are we trying to spread the anime and manga industry or something or just answering question related to it? 

As Shown on the tour page:


  Anime and Manga is a question and answer site for enthusiastic anime and manga fans. It's built and run by you as part of the Stack Exchange network of Q&A sites. With your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed answers to every question about anime and manga.


I understand how low-quality posts are disliked by users and workers but why is this a reason to get rid of some very interesting features? It states that we want a detailed answer to every question about anime and manga, but doesn't getting rid of certain features defeat that purpose?

I am, indeed, talking about identification-requests here, and I don't know if there are other cases like it, but it is a shame to see such an interesting type of questions being disallowed. Especially for new comers: most of the new comers that came to this site posted an identification request; I was one of them. We are selfish people, we only wanted to fulfill our inquiries. But it feels bad to have what technological people think as common sense slammed into my face: because I had barely any contact with technology, I didn't know what a "reverse image search" was until I came to this site. You can't expect a beginner to get everything right the first time: we need time. Not everybody has a sophisticated thought towards anime and manga, they came here because they can't find a anime/manga that they have interest in, and as a community it's not very nice nor good thing to just refuse to answer their question.

I missed the chance for putting my voice out there during the decision due to certain reasons, and since I would like to think that I am part of this community, I would still like to get my thoughts across. It's sad to see potential users of this website to leave. There's a chance that they will come back to this website and contribute to this website; it's a slim chance but it's better than 0. The more people we have in this community the better for the site, right? There are many people out there that know a lot less than we do (or you do) and have other things to do with their life: it's hard to track down a anime/manga that doesn't show up on any searches. The site says I can still ask them in the chat room and I appreciate those people who tried to help, but come on: 4 responses average with even lower quality and all of them replies as "no". And how many people look back in the chat to see if there are any questions? Not many.

I had a look at some id-requests that were kept for historical value or something and they had some really good questions and responses. The example here is where a father joined this community and asked a question for his son. How many fathers would do that? What about the guy tried his best to draw a character to find an anime? He got over 30 up votes. Is that still a bad question? What the site is doing is: because certain newcomers don't know what they're doing, the site just completely gets rid of the privilege for everyone else who liked it and followed the rules. 

I'm going to trigger a lot of people but it doesn't matter: I want to get my thoughts across.
The aim of this site is to answer every question possible related to anime and manga. If the site just gets rid of the bits that it doesn't like, what is the purpose of this site if we just shutdown questions that some people don't like? What ever happened to answering every question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are "identification-request" questions not allowed on this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did you have a look at [our tour page](http://anime.stackexchange.com/tour)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well we certinally aren't about id requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Yes i have, i have now edited the questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You should probably edit your title too, then, since your real question is "Why are id-requests not allowed here?" @Dragonb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for your hope that new users who come by to ask id-req questions will then come back later to contribute, I'd point you to [this Meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/2467/49) for a better notion of how unrealistic that expectation is.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can also have a look at [this other Meta post](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/2805/49) for a better understanding of the reasoning behind getting rid of id-reqs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The [Id-request stats](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/2470/1458) Mights also enlighten you a bit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat From the statistics, i can see around 10% of all the people who came back and stayed for over a month which is around 100-200, that's still a lot of people. and if the snow-ball effect happens it will be a lot more. with the reasons point 1: this is difficult but not impossible, this is why language exists, to communicate, if the asker really bothered he would try to explain more as time goes on. point 2: this is not always the case but for most of time it can't be helped, not everyone is nice or kind,. point 3: again they don't care enough. but what about those that do care?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to write a more elaborate answer to your question, @Dragon. Gimme a few minutes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please note that question votes on meta don't reflect on reputation, and merely show how much people (dis)agree with your proposition/idea/views.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Everyone's given you lots of great reasons why we banned id requests, but I'm not sure it's really possible to understand at a deep, emotional level why we banned them until you've spent two years writing "Can you please tell us the exact year instead of saying 'When I was young'?" under five questions a day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda what if they can't remember?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then we can't help them, @Dragon :) But Torisuda's point is that these questions were a resource drain, demanding the community to put a lot of time and effort into repetitive tasks that had no good outcome.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat is correct—and until you've spent that time and effort on those repetitive tasks that had no good outcome, I don't know if any explanation can convince you that banning id requests was the right thing. (You might still get your chance, though: [the invasion of Sci-Fi & Fantasy has begun](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/137265/28578).) I certainly wouldn't have supported a complete ban during my first three months on the site; it took nearly two years of drudgery to convince me they needed to go or I did.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To back up Torisuda's last sentence: as I pointed out, the tone of the community towards these types of question changed gradually as time went by — reading through the Meta discussions can give you a clear notion of this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I remember there was some time where one could have provided some input on the topic, but I missed that very, very narrow time window of I think it was only three months or so. I'd have voted in favor of keeping identification requests, as I like answering them, if I can.


















Like it says in the first paragraph on the https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourtour page we're a question and answer site for anime & manga fans. People coming here to ask or answer already (generally) have an idea of what they're talking about, since they want either a greater understanding of a particular anime or manga or to share their own understanding.

Our primary purpose isn't to spread knowledge of the industry, and as such we don't allow questions that ask about recommendations (and now ID requests too). However, being a site where large amounts of information are shared, visitors are naturally going to gain a wider awareness of the medium.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We do encourage recommendations in [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-) though!


















Others might answer in more lengthy posts, but I'm gonna keep it short.

The main reasons to ban ID requests were:


ID requests in their nature are useful to very few people, and the core purpose of any http://stackexchange.com/sitesStackExchange site is to collect questions and answers that would be useful to many people;
Overwhelming majority of them were very scarce recollections, poorly detailed and could match anything. With only "Red hair" or "There was a robot" you could list a lot of works, and they would all be wrong;
Most users have not bothered to read our very helpful guidelines that could dramatically improve chances of getting an answer, despite these guidelines being thrown at them everywhere.
ID requests have become a very big percentage of the site's posts, and the main purpose of the site was shifting away from what the existing users have joined for. This was a great risk to site's diversity.


The situation was an example of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_SeptemberEternal September where new users flow in and dilute the quality content, and existing frustrated users leaving because they don't like where the site is going.

And it is bad in the long term, because people would see all those badly worded and mis-formatted posts and think this is what we expect to see. 

This wasn't good for the site, and the majority voted against this.



Most of us know that ID requests can be a great way to introduce people to anime and manga, but it just doesn't work out well on this site, as this 3-year experiment has shown. There are still many other sites out there that accept ID requests. Consider joining them instead.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5but how many people actually go and look at really old questions? and i know i'm asking for some ridiculous things here but can't they add a system where if a question doesn't get responded by the person who posted it, it gets deleted and when the user comes back, a notice pops up and he can chose whether to reopen or not? also could you please explain a bit what the existing users joined for? and if people get frustrated, can't they just not look at them. and just an interesting fact, this website shows up at the top if you search identification request or similar in googleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5StackExchange network started with StackOverflow, a site for programmers. The rules were not to help one person with very specific problem that would be useless to anyone else, but to generalize questions and give answers that would be useful to many. Then other sites appeared, dedicated to anime, movies, cooking, music, etc. The main principle stayed the same, and the users joined those site for the same reason (but in different topics) − because they saw that they could learn a lot by reading other questions and answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Everybody can hide any tag, and then the site would get swamped by bad posts which nobody improves because there aren't enough people who want to see or edit them. This would dramatically reduce the site's overall quality, putting it's existence at risk, because StackExchange moderators regularly review the sites and can decide to remove them completely in case the community can't keep up the level of quality. This hasn't happened yet, because we, as the current community, decided to prevent this from happening by banning ID requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5but being broad doesn't help everyone either, it does help more than ID requests but people are individuals and they're all different and sometimes even ID requests can help others as well. examples such as it may give some story line in the question which interests people or introduce people to new anime/manga they haven't tried or never thout of trying beforeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and also, a lot of new users in general post some really bad/useless questions like how many episodes does **** have or when is *** getting dubbed/subbed/releasedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It hardly interest people to read/watch that manga/anime if it is written in gibberish. It only give them (and the editor) headache.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There have been "too broad" and "too localized" close reasons which basically are against questions that are not useful to many users. ID requests would fall under "too localized". And as others said, the purpose of this Questions and Answers site (which is what all StackExchange sites are) is not to introduce people to any topics, but to answer questions within these topics. But *to add anything useful* you have to be already introduced to the topic. In our case, we expect users who already have seen some anime or read manga.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Bad (not useful to many people) questions like what you give as an example we downvote close eventually. If a question is useful to many, but is badly formatted, we edit so they would look as good as any other properly formatted question.


















1. Nature of ID Request Questions

ID Request question is a question about the identity of a certain thing. In our case, that would be the identity of a certain picture taken from an anime/manga. However, this kind of a question would not be a question about anime/manga. In such question, the asker is not asking about the manga/anime since they don't even know what manga/anime it is. It would be a question about the identity of a certain image. Anime SE is a site to ask about anime and manga not identity of a certain image taken from The Web God Only Knows.

2. Site Contribution

Most of the ID Request questions posted here are done by people with less than 200 reputation points. What does it means? It means that they are not contributing much to the site. A contributing user would naturally have a high reputation points as they ask and answer questions. If you would check their profile, you'll see that many of them are unregistered users and has only one question, which is the ID Request question. I checked this on the ID Request questions that is still left in this site since it has >3 up votes, which means that I excluded those with awful questions.

ID Request questions hardly contributes something to this site.

3. Burden to Editor

There were lots more ID Request questions that has negative votes due to the lack of effort to put in good (or at the very very least, passable) question including, but not not limited to, image only question, gibberish language (no proper dot, comma, punctuations), proper formatting. I'm not saying that non English speaking users are not welcome here, no, we welcome them, but they also need to do their best to make sure their question is understandable. We have active users monitoring questions and editing them for this very reason. Surely at the very least the asker could put proper formatting, dot, comma, and punctuations to ensure that those reviewing the question could understand them and repair it. Such question was removed and is no longer available here, so I'm saying this based on my experience here.

4. Site Quality & User Base

As pointed by Hakase, point 3 caused some regulars to leave, while at the same time hardly attracts new regular user.

While you might argue that the down and the close vote on the question discouraged users from becoming a regular at this site, the closed questions are all closed with proper reasoning which is visible for all to see. Had they fixed the question to fit with the standard, we would have voted to reopen them happily. What happened in most cases was that they left it as it is. This happened over and over and degraded the quality of this site, so of course we have to take action to stop this, and that is by banning it altogether.

Their behavior (asking and then leaving without giving a darn care on whether they get a proper answer) also suggest that from the very beginning they have no interest in joining us and enrich their knowledge about anime and manga.

Conclusion

Add my answer to answers posted by other users, we are not removing bits that we don't like. We remove bits that is not related to anime and manga. We remove bits that is bad for the site. Since we love anime and manga, of course we would.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5point 1: people don't know where the image was from but it was definitely anime/manga of a sort, isn't that enough to make it related to anime and manga? point 2: it is a bad habit to do nothing and expect something in return but if you don't answer their question become they haven't done anything to the site, doesn't that make you the same as them? point 3: again simply just delete it with a comment to improve it, it they do, great, if they don't, the question can stay dead. point 4: same as point 3, and we have thousands of users on this site, there're billions of people in the world,b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5none of them are the same. some people are really nice where as others are honestly complete retards. using the bad people as examples of the world is going to end in a negative cycle.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51. I think it is not related.
2. We don't answer it because either it is gibberish, or don't have enough information not because they don't contribute to the site. Many of those ID Request questions were closed with a proper answers, that is it can be found with Reverse Image Search and we give the link on how you do such search.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53 & 4. We have limited number of active users who would scourge through the review queue. Yes we have thousands of users, but not all of them active regularly, not all of them would review the questions. Asking those users to comply regularly to users who hardly put effort is downright evil. Also as I pointed out in last paragraph of my 4th point, those users doesn't show interest in joining and enriching themselves.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5point 1:debatable point 2: if it's gibberish delete it and tell them, not enough info, same thing can be done. it'll be like a teacher telling a student to redo his work until the student gets it right, it is a bit more effort but it is plausible. what about those that for some reason can't be found? google reverse image search is crap. same goes for point 3&4. it's just an suggestion but there should be a way that makes everyone happyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Point 2. Problem is, we already did that and it's not working. If you think you have a solution that would make everyone happy, then go ahead post it. we would like to hear about it.


















So the first section of your question is answered by https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourthe tour page (as you yourself edited in) as well as by https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3875/49Matt's answer. It seems like you actually have a good grasp of what this site's about, and your edit leads me to believe that that is indeed the case. Which brings us to what you actually want to talk about: identification requests!

You raise a lot of different points about this topic, and I'll try to address them all separately, but not necessarily in the order in which you raise them. Note that whenever I use "we" below, I mean "the community" and not "the moderation team" or "the Stack Exchange staff."

The site's been around since December 2012, and the oldest identification-request question is from that same month. That means identification-requests have been around since the site's been around. You can see all the discussions we've had on Meta about them https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-questionshere (some might be missing, if they weren't tagged with /questions/tagged/identification-questionsidentification-questions). If you peruse through those questions there, you'll see our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/702/49multiple https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/711/49attempts https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/783/49at https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/834/49dealing https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/891/49with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1063/49them — we didn't just ban them out of the blue, and neither were we completely rigid about them from the start — before we decided to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2805/49have a definitive discussion on whether to keep them or not.


  it feels bad to have what technological people think as common sense slammed into my face: because I had barely any contact with technology, I didn't know what a "reverse image search" was until I came to this site. You can't expect a beginner to get everything right the first time: we need time.  


I get that, I really do. In fact, the community gets that too. That's why, as the Meta discussions show, we tweaked our ways of telling newcomers that their post was sub par, and how they could improve them. We went from not having any specific guidelines or close reasons, to having them and tweaking them several times. The goal of these guidelines was always to try to help users who asked these questions, either by letting them know that we needed more details, or by pointing them to some resource that would allow them to find what they were looking for that time and in future times — never to make them feel bad about not being so comfortable about technology (if that ever happened, I'd like to apologize to you in the name of the community). Unfortunately, and despite our multiple tweaks to the guidelines and processes, we always ended up with the same question: Is it worth it?

Most of these questions were being asked by new comers, as you point out yourself. You have a whole paragraph devoted to expressing your belief in a positive response to the question I asked above, and in the fact that those new comers are potential contributors to the community. However, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2467/49experience shows us otherwise: most of the users who came by to have an anime or manga identified for them ended up being what I'd call "hit-and-run" users — ~97.5% (given the sample available at the time I ran the numbers, 1,212 users) of the users whose first question was an id-req created their account in the same day they asked their question, ~85% of the same sample never came back to the site after a month had gone by, and ~84% had less than 5 posts on our site. This means that, after two and a half years, only 33 out of 1,212 users had more than 5 posts on our site. So, we can ask again: Is it worth it?

And the conclusion we came to was that no, it's not worth it. https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3876/49Hakase's answer has a pretty good summary of why not, and so does https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2805/49this Meta post. In fact, you mention the problem in the question itself (my emphasis):


  most of the new comers that came to this site posted an identification request; I was one of them. We are selfish people, we only wanted to fulfill our inquiries.


That's precisely what we found ourselves struggling with: the community was spending time and effort into helping people who weren't helping themselves. We spent time discussing and implementing guidelines, we spent effort in trying to look for anime or manga and requesting the users for clarification that, in many cases, did not come, when the users simply seemed to care less about their own question than we did. 

Now you do mention, in your penultimate paragraph, some cases of users who showed a lot of effort in actually getting the community the details they were asking for — and that's precisely why we decided to keep some of those questions locked and you can still see them. But let's be frank: those were the edge cases, not the norm, and it does not make sense for us to optimize our guidelines, efforts and processes for the edge cases — especially if the norm is something the community simply does not find worthwhile.

You have a lot of reading you can do, as pointed out above, on why the community ended up reaching this conclusion. But, to sum it up:


We're a Q&A site, and we'd like to help out as many people as possible by answering their questions. https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/askingWe have a few rules we need those people to follow, though, and we frown upon low quality content;
Most of the id-req questions fell under that category — low quality content — and ended up producing a lot of work for and demanding a lot of effort from the community;
Furthermore, id-reqs didn't quite fit our Q&A model, since they would only end up helping whoever asked them — we even used to have a close reason for that ("https://youtu.be/0hEtQ70scho?t=29m17stoo localized"1);
Most of the time, whoever asked the question did not care enough to follow up on it — which, again, meant the community had to spent time and effort maintaining these questions;
The site was slowly being overtaken by id-reqs, which, given the above, produced burnout in the community, and in the most active users in particular.


To finalize: there's still chat, where many of our regulars are happy to give you a hand in trying to find your anime — note that, as with the case when we had these questions in the main site, though, they're likely to frown upon simple "hey, you know this anime with the guy with the red hair?" type of questions, since we're not here to do people's work for them.
If all that still makes you go "but why won't you help me?!?!?1!" then I need to point out the obvious: there's plenty of other sites and communities out there that are not as stringent about quality as we are, and they're likely glad to help you out :)



1 I'd recommend watching that whole talk, as it's pretty interesting and also helps people understand what Stack Overflow (and all the Stack Exchange sites, to which its model was "exported") is about. From minute 26 or so on, Joel actually starts talking about SO.

You don't need to force yourself to participate, if you don't feel that you are able to. Our aim for this site is not to answer every possible question related to anime and manga. This site exists as a resource to supplement your interest in anime and manga and its subculture. 

We claim to neither be the "best" nor the most knowledgeable site on the topic. There are many other people and sources much more knowledgeable than the core of this community combined. Here we will try our best to help you answer your question with as little distractions as possible.

The Stack Exchange "cultural anthropology"

The concept of a Q&A site can be tricky for a new user to grasp at first. Initially they think something along the lines of "Question and answer, huh? That means that I can ask anything on the topic, right?" Partially, so. The Stack Exchange family of sites exist to collect and archive useful artefacts on specific topic. The model first started with programming question on Stack Overflow, as a lot of troubleshooting questions were collected in web forums. It was very difficult for an average user to sift through all the posts and seperate the relevant from the irrelevant. The voting, reputation, and answering system was created (and honed with time) as a platform to draw attention to these artefacts and spotlight the most useful ones, all the while giving users recognition for their contribution.  

You may be think, "Okay, thats fine and all, but this is a site about Japanese cartoons and all that shit. There's nothing remotely professionally about us. We don't have professionals here (that we know of), we're just a bunch of nerds into a cultural export of Japan (or a derivative of it)." You would be right, we are a recreational Stack Exchange site and shouldn't take ourselves as seriously as our more professional sibling sites. However, even if we don't take ourselves as seriously. We need to maintain a consistent level of quality and consistency. Which is why not all question are on-topic.

Our expectations and you

We don't expect you to be literate on the technological aspect of computers nor the internet. Nor do we expect you to be up to date on the latest subculture trend and show, or even know Japanese. We don't care about where you come from, what you like, or what questions you've asked before. We're all here because we enjoy anime and manga. That's all that matters. When something is closed we generally provide an contextual explanation of why and suggestions on what else you can do.

This site exists to help you help yourself and others with questions or problems you many have on the site topic. It is not a place for you to ask people to do things for you. You don't go to a librarian asking them to do your science project. You ask them for leads to resources so you can complete it yourself. Unlike web forums where the topic is typically subjective, we try to keep a objective, neutral tone. We prefer to get to solving the problem at hand than delve into long discussions on it (thats's what chat's for). 

We won't do your work for you, but we'll do what we can to help you get what you need to finish it. If you stumbled looking for something, tell us where you've stumbled and where you'd like to go. We'll get you up and running in the right direction. We won't however pull you directly to your destination.

On recommendations and identification topics

Recommendations are off-topic because many of us have different tastes. What works for you might not be my cup of tea. Recommendations tend to spiral into back and forth discussions, ill-suited for the Q&A format of our site, which is why we invite users to ask for them in our http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-main chatroom. 

Identification questions by themselves aren't that much of a problem. The users that ask them are the problem that vexes us. You see, your memories degrade after time (for most people at least). Files of memories get shuffled around from time to time, memories sometime merge with unrelated ones. It's not always a reliable source to draw from. It's easy for someone to ask about something they thing they remember, but you have to consider what a person attempting to answer your question would be doing. They need to cross reference your descriptions with things they know. It's fine if all the information needed is there, but often times this is not true. But rarely do users provide sufficient information despite our pleas. 

While many have claimed that there are benefits to identification questions. https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2467/can-we-get-some-more-definitive-numbers-on-identification-request-statsStatistical and anecdotal evidence indicate the disadvantages in keeping the questions severely outweigh any advantages. The ecosystem of identification questions were unsustainable (someone needs to keep watch over them). More identification questions were being asked than answered. Many lacked crucial details or were vaguely worded. Many identification questions askers never bothered coming back after posting, essentially abandoning them if we didn't answer promptly enough. It took more time and resources to regulate questions and answers from one tag than all the other tags combined. We're tried many time to find solution, but the result was just more of the hemorrhaging of identification questions.

If you are not aware, as part of our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3839/identification-request-cleanup-phase-3-final-delete-lockprevious cleanup efforts, we only kept a portion of the better identification questions for historical value. A very large portion of what you don't see are vaguely worded questions that were otherwise abandoned by their owners. Time and time again we've tried to appeal to these users to little avail. Doing so gets tedious after a few years. We've tried guidelines, and even simple checklists for details these identification questions should have, but few new users bother to heed them. These low quality post eventually became regarded as shitposts and the tag eventually became ignored by much of the core community. Seeing so many low quality identification questions on the front page of the site really discourages you from using the site. Sooner or later the site will be overrun by them. At that time there might be no one left to bother answering them. This was not something the community wanted. So a decision was made to clean house and blacklist the tag. 

As a side note, old, non-negative questions that have answers with low views and no accepted answers get bumped by the https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community?tab=profileCommunity bot user, usually starting 30 days after the question was posted. So older questions with no accepted answers don't get neglected.

Audience and scope

More people is not always better. Even if you have an large audience base, if you don't engage them and get them to contribute, they are as good as ghost members of a club. We won't force anyone that does not wish to participate to do so. The door is always open in our http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-main chatroom for those that wish to participate but are unsure of where to start. We're a small community with users from various parts of the world. We might not all be as willing or available to answer your questions, but don't get discouraged if we can't help you initially feel free try again at another time. Someone else might be there to better assist you or at least point you in the right direction. 

Not all questions are a good fit for our site. We try to answer them as best we can when possible without rumors or speculations. Sometime we succeed while other times we fail (miserably). 

We try to draw a line at a point where we can provide you with the best and most accurate information, but know that many of us aren't professionals on the topic (i.e. content creators, copyright/licensing lawyers). We're not privy to a lot of things. One being an English language site we miss out on press releases and interview from within the industry. Two being we're not professionals so we can only give you our perspective as fan, especially on the gray areas of legality, or creating anime and manga content.

We're just enthusiastic fans (like you) looking to help other fans. Sometimes we get a little trigger happy with post and comment. We all human (most of us at least) we are not always perfect and make mistakes. It's alright to call us out on it if we do make them, so we can correct ourselves.

Afterword

We don't expect you to conform to the Stack Exchange way of thinking if you don't want to. Nor do we expect you to read through the mountains of text in our help center or videos about Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow's founding principles (who has the time for that?). Not all the philosophies apply to us. We're not Stack Overflow, we're not Arqade, we're not Movies and TV, we're not Science Fiction & Fantasy. We are us and they are them. What works for them might not work for us.

As a user all we'd like for you to do is enjoy using the site and have fun where you can. Unlike other Stack Exchanges, we tend to me more lenient on the rules. If you make a mistake, we usually try to inform you on what you did wrong and how to rectify it than admonish you. If you have any further questions or concerns, you may use meta or chat to reach out to the community for help. Don't worry (most of us) won't bite. We'll be here for you when you feel that you are ready.

I have a friend who I feel would love anime if he would give it a chance. He lets some of the common misconceptions and stereotypes of anime keep him from watching some fantastic works of entertainment. 

I want to introduce anime to him, but I will probably only be able to convince him to watch one show, due to his current lack of interest.

What show should I use to showcase anime in its glory to my friend? I want something that's interesting on multiple levels (violent but also mentally stimulating, etc.). Unfortunately, it probably has to be dubbed in English (eventually he'll get to the good stuff). Does anyone have any recommendatons? My current ideas were Attack on Titan, Steins;Gate, etc.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Best first anime for anime newbie?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[take a look at this](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/1204/you-want-recommendations-heres-a-list-of-them)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you really want your friend to get into anime, you'll have to gauge their interest in different genres first. "Most popular" anime doesn't mean "liked by everybody". I know a few people who only watch one or two works of all the anime (like Mushishi) and there's no convincing them to watch anything else. Good luck and don't despair or blame your friend if it doesn't work out as you wanted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase I saw that list of recommendations, but I feel that is for more seasoned anime watchers. For example, I don't think that the Monogatari series is a good show for a newbie to anime to watch (this is subjective, I know). I was more looking for recommendations that other people have had experience successfully opening the 'anime door' to previously uninterested people.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is it heavily depends on each person. You could ask people who have introduced their friends to anime when there were not many good introduction level works, and the choice would be narrow enough. But now there are many more good works to choose from and the potential for success is greater thanks to that. So I suggest, as a seasoned viewer, to consider each genre and your friend's favorite shows, compare and present them with some choice. Don't forget different art styles, as (in my experience) people sometimes really dislike certain styles. And try to avoid 42457637-episode ones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like @Hakase said, it depends on each person. As for me, I watched Sora no Otoshimono at first, ( I know it's not the best anime, but hey, it pique my interest at first )  I came on my friend's house when he was watching it. And then I watch Angel Beats, just because there's Angel on title and as you might know, Sora no Otoshimono is about angeloid. This is the first time I really got attached to anime, after that a friends of mine recommend The World God Only Knows, and that deal the rest. I've watched hundreds of title and the number still keep going :)


















Like include the tag in every question? That wouldn't make sense. Tags are used to denote that the question is directly related to something. We could as well add https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/animeanime tag to most of our questions, and it wouldn't be very useful.

If we had a number of questions that would be on topic and asking about something directly related to MyAnimeList site in a way that would make sense to use a tag for it… actually, I can't even imagine such a scenario.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was more thinking about questions specifically dealing with MAL and the website, but now that I'm reconsidering it's probably considered off-topic for this website.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, yes, because we mainly deal with questions directly related to anime or manga, and not the resources related to them. I guess we might have a few exceptions but in this case I just don't know how it could possibly fit unless the site became a known anime producer or a distribution network like [CrunchyRoll](http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/crunchyroll).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ThePickleTickler if the question is about MyAnimeList then it might make sense however i don't recall any question like that. i do recall answers which talk about MyAnimeList in which we don't normally update tags in a question to reflect the answers that have been posted which is why, before they were made off-topic, id requests weren't updated to have a series tag after they were answered


















I asked https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/35574/why-was-the-nudity-not-censored-in-dragon-ballthis question on August 4th, and just got a reply today (August 9th). To support the answerer, I upvoted his/her answer. I am not ready to choose it as the best answer, but I will likely select it if no one else answers.

However, upon upvoting his/her answer, I got +5 reputation. Usually you don't get any reputation for upvoting any questions or answers, so why did I get +5?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why did I get +5 rep for voting on this answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe someone voted your question up at the same time?

Voting on somebody elses stuff doesn't provide you with any rep, if it did I'd be challenging Krazer for the top spot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt but you only have 585 votes cast and krazer has 2715b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5#Michael McQuade I was just having a bit of a joke :Lb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@krazer you have a challengerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a first for me:  Someone asking why they got an addition to reputation........

There's a Hot Network Questions list and it has an RSS feed which could be used to create a chat feed bot.

http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-Maid Café (メイド喫茶)
Welcome back, my Master! (お帰りなさいませ、ご主人様!) Sit wherever you'd like and enjoy some General Chat for anime.stackexchange.com. Now serving anime and manga images in regular intervals via our maid service. To learn more about our maid service, please visit: meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/1166/191

We, as a community, have been always using the same name. New friends and a whole new story were built using that name. It's almost an traditional and it carries a whole human value with it. It's neccessary to keep it? No, sure no. We'll still  chat and have fun together. But, as a tradition, it's cool to keep it. It's an identity thing.
The term Maid café also says a lot about the chat organization. It remembers the culture that's related to the community not only in the chat but in the main Q&A site too - the japanese culture. With our bots (our "maids"), we get served with what we want and what we need. It's complete by itself.
It also says a lot about us because we're just like a Maid Café: you can just pull a chair and enjoy stuff you like with nice people. It's inviting. You can feel like there are some jokes in the air and there are people who will interact with you.
More over, Maid cafés are not limited to anime only, which is exactly like us. There are a lot of programmers in the chat and game fans, so random subjects just pop and we can talk about them without worrying if that's part of the chat or not. C'mon, chat's are made to chat!
And, above anything, we, as a community, have been always using this name. New friends and a whole new story were built using it. It's almost an traditional and it carries a whole human value with it. It's neccessary to keep it? No, it's not. We'll still  chat and have fun together. But, as a tradition, it's cool to keep it. It's an identity thing. We are the Maid Café . :)

The RSS feed for "hot questions" for on our main site is:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/feeds/hothttps://anime.stackexchange.com/feeds/hot

You don't need to parse or filter from the feed for all network questions. Just use the site specific hot questions feed and change the site url as needed.

Alternatively, you can use a third-party solution like http://www.feedrinse.com/FeedRinse to create a custom filtered feed.

Here is an example of the hot network questions feed with only questions from CodeGolf.SE:

http://www.feedrinse.com/services/rinse/?rinsedurl=d9080bfa77f2f87631f6515a906b6f8chttp://www.feedrinse.com/services/rinse/?rinsedurl=d9080bfa77f2f87631f6515a906b6f8c

The filter criteria was simple, look at the <title>, if "codegolf.stackexchange.com" is in the title, show it in the feed, otherwise ignore it.

You do things with this like combining it with some service like IF This Then That (IFTTT)'s SMS channel to send you a SMS text alert every time a hot question appears on the list that is from code golf.

Maybe these are the hottest on the site, but I'm mostly interested in hotness levels that result in being seen on the whole network. So I suppose filtering the main feed would be an easy way to achieve that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can customize and restructure existing feeds with [IF This Then That (IFTTT)](https://ifttt.com/wtf).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you know it's not happening


















I'd like to draw attention of suggested edit reviewers to a certain user who is currently adding Dragon Ball series tag to a bunch of already DB-tagged questions:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/31640https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/31640

I thought series tags should be used only for questions which directly ask about something that applies to all the works in the series? Or am I wrong and all those edits are correct?

That's what will determine if these tag edits were correct. (I was under the impression they were correct, but I remembered wrong; the older meta never says that, so it's probably something we should decide.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well, I'm not sure what happened here so I just brought it up for others to discuss since I'm not very well acquainted with the discussion you linked to and dragon ball series neither.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, fair enough. That discussion was a long time ago, and I had remembered wrongly how it went—I'd thought we were doing the "series tag + franchise tag" for both Dragon Ball and Full Metal Alchemist, but it turns out we were doing "series tag only" for Dragon Ball. For that reason I approved some of those tag edits, but I started skipping them to let others take a look in case I was wrong.


















As an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation, we will once again be holding a Q&A with the candidates in connection with the moderator elections.  Participation is completely voluntary.


  The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3914/2016-moderator-election-qa-questionnairehere.


Here's how it'll work:


During the nomination phase, (so, until Monday, August 29th at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 pm EDT on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post one question per answer.
We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.
This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.
At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.
Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.
This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&A.


If you have any questions or feedback about this process, feel free to post as a comment here.

The 2016 Community Moderator Election is now underway!

Community moderator elections have three phases:


Nomination phase
Primary phase
Election phase


Most elections take between two and three weeks, but this depends on how many candidates there are.

Policy: Tagging multiple continuities in a franchise https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/needs-clarificationneeds-clarification

Back in January, we started an experiment on tagging multiple continuities, as described in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2719/7579A certain multivariate experiment: Testing changes to series tags based on story continuity as a response to the discussion on https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2690/7579Policy Review: Tagging - separate continuities. 

Reason: 

As far as I could tell, we never finished the experiment or declared a result. This led a confused user to start tagging Dragon Ball questions with the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-seriesdragon-ball-series tag, and at least one confused edit reviewer (me) to approve those edits, as described in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3891/7579Somebody's adding series tags, possibly incorrectly. 

Remarks: 

I argued for the more complex tagging policies we tried with Full Metal Alchemist https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2700/7579here, but I think if we do adopt it we should limit it to certain franchises since it is more work to maintain. I have some ideas on how to decide that we can discuss when this policy comes up for review.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm addressing it [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3906/policy-suggestion-applying-series-continuity-and-franchise-tags-globally-on-thi).


















As an long overdue conclusion to our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2719/a-certain-multivariate-experiment-testing-changes-to-series-tags-based-on-storyexperiment with series and franchise tags, I would like to suggest a new blanket policy on how use franchise tags and apply series continuity with series tags. 

There seems to be many users favoring the use of franchise tags, as they help keep series together and make them easier to look up. This is especially helpful for series with many different spin-offs or continuities (such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundamgundam).

In light of that, I would like to propose a new policy for the including franchise tags for all series with spin-off or continuities. Here are some suggested guideline on how to tag series of different continuities and determine if a franchise needs one.


Not all franchises need a series tag, but popular franchises with at least three major continuities (two if they have different continuities but share a very similar name like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist) and spin-offs benefit in having them as it helps keep things together and makes them more easily searchable and categorizable. We can consider a franchise to be popular if there are at least 10 questions about series within that franchise (e.g., https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundamgundam)

For an example, if you want to answer Gundam questions, but only want to only want to focus on question of the original UC universe, you can search the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundam-seriesgundam-series and pick out specific UC series like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundam-unicorngundam-unicorn. Splitting up the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundamgundam tag allows users to better associate the tag with a specific series than the franchise as a whole.
Some series benefit is having metaverse tag, as there are works from specific groups that exist in a collective multiverse but are set in parallel universes. A fairly well-known example of this is the work of Nasu Kinoko of Type Moon, the writer behind the Fate/Stay Night and Tsukihime series. The works of the collective multiverse are referred to as the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nasuversenasuverse, after him. 
Such series include not only the Fate and Tsukihime franchises, but also other Type Moon works such as Mahoutsukai no Yoru and Kara no Kyoukai. Many of these franchise share core concepts like the Root (Radix), Counter Force, Magecraft, and True Magic. Having such a metaverse tag makes asking more general questions on the worldbuilding concepts of the multiverses easier without needing to tie it down to a specific series or franchise
Series tags will be skewed in favor of their anime series, as users of this site tend to favor anime over manga. 

For an example, while the Dragonball manga includes the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonballdragonball anime and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragonball-zdragonball-z anime, they are treated with seperate series tags
Questions specifically about the source material should use the syntax {{series-name}}-manga such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dragon-ball-mangadragon-ball-manga for the Dragonball manga series and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-mangafullmetal-alchemist-manga for the Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) manga specifically. 
Questions on the novels and light novel source material specifically can use a similar syntax {{series-name}}-novel or {{series-name}}-vn ("visual novel" is abbreviated for brevity).
Example: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/robotics-note-vnrobotics-note-vn for questions specifically about the Robotics; Note visual novel, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/perfect-insider-novelperfect-insider-novel for question about the Perfect Insider (Subete wa F ni Naru)  
Split series based on universe/story continuity. Start with the name of the original series as the name for series tag. This way it's easier for users to decerns which series within a franchise with multiple continuities a question is referring to without needing to read the body.

For an example, all the Sailor Moon anime (R, S, Super S, Sailor Stars), with the exception of the Crystal reboot, in one continuous series. So the should be tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sailor-moonsailor-moon. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sailor-moon-crystalsailor-moon-crystal should have it's own tag because it's of a seperate continuity. 
All tags should favor the English franchise/series name where possible (official-localized English names), but also have the original language name as a synonym. 
We are departing from the previous policy of "pick the most popular name based on web search results," because a majority of the time the original language names are popular, simply because they were known by these name before localizations (therefore skewed). Series with no localized names can get an exemption here, but once they do get localized, their name should be swapped and synonymized  
For series names try to abbreviate commonly recognizable words to make the titles shorter and keep them within the tag character limit. If a series name is too long try to abbreviate the title as best you can and add a synonym with as much as you can fit.  

For an example, "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood" can be abbreviated to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-brotherhoodfma-brotherhood and have the synonym "fullmetal-alchemist-bro." This is so if someone types in "fullmetal alchemist" when adding an tag, they will see both tags.


In simple terms what we are doing is:


Adding franchise tags to popular series with at least three different continuities or if two continuities in a series share a name. Only focus on the popular tags with at least 10 questions for now.

Examples: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundam-seriesgundam-serieshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zeta-gundamzeta-gundamhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gundam-08th-ms-teamgundam-08th-ms-teamhttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/victory-gundamvictory-gundam, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-seriesfma-serieshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-2003fullmetal-alchemist-2003https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-brotherhoodfma-brotherhood


You may add a metaverse tag (in place of a franchise tag) and include it in questions that asks about concepts that exists within a multiverse

Example: "What is the difference between the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception of Shiki Ryougi and Shiki Tohno?" https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nasuversenasuversehttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kara-no-kyoukaikara-no-kyoukaihttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tsukihimetsukihime

Split series continuities based on whether they exist in the same universe. Use the name of the original series as the series tag. 

For an example, the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist anime and the Brotherhood adaptation of the manga series have some very distinct differences in world, character, and story. The tags should be differentiated to avoid confusion.
Please use the official English language series names where possible. If none exist, use the the original language romanization, until it does get a localized name.


We are looking to normalize series tag titles to be in in English, because we are a primarily English language site.

Abbreviate the series names wherever possible and favor the anime series titles. As long is it is recognizable by fans then it should be fine. User your own discretion when adding a new title, if you are unsure ask for help on meta or chat.

For an example: Ouran Highschool Host Club can be abbreviated to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ouran-hs-host-clubouran-hs-host-club. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (being too long to fit unabbreviated) can become https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-brotherhoodfma-brotherhood. With a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-brofullmetal-alchemist-bro synonym so it shows up when someone types "fullmetal alchemist" when searching for a tag. 

Adding a tag synonym for abbreviated titles is optional, but highly recommended if you are altering the tag name drastically (like with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) 
Only add a tag if there is a direct relevance to the question. Don't pad a question with unneeded tags.


Please take some time to review the proposal and suggest any changes or give general feedback. If acceptable, I'll look to implement these changes after the election.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Policy Suggestion: Applying series continuity and franchise tags globally on this siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is pretty much exactly what I had in mind to suggest when I brought this issue up on the other post. +1.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've been asking for this for years. +1 (though I recommend [fma-2003] so it fits with the other tags.) Where would *NGE* and *Rebuild* fall in this? I believe they both use [neon-genesis-evangelion].b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Killua the original TV series, *End of Evangelion* and the *Rebuild* movies are seperate, so it should be [tag:evangelion], [tag:end-of-evangelion], [tag:evangelion-rebuild] respectively. The full name was used for the [tag:fullmetal-alchemist-2003] (with the date) was used specifically to distinguish the series, I expected users to tag everything as "fullmetal-alchemist" if I didn't differentiate the two (because they don't read meta). It is in my opinion that [tag:fullmetal-alchemist-2003] and [tag:fma-brotherhood] are distinctly different enough for most users to distinguish.


















This is an admirable effort, but ther are a few problems that I see.


Adding additional suffixes like -vn and whatnot is going to make our https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/209248/tag length problems even worse, leading to a need for more stupid abbreviated workarounds. 
This approach doesn't correctly represent the ontology of tags. "Higher-order" tags, like franchise and metaverse tags, should, in most cases, not really be tags, but rather be "properties" attached to series tags. Concretely, one will typically not ask a question about fma-series; rather, fma-series ought to be metadata on fullmetal-alchemist-2003 or whatever. Put alternatively, there should be an implication that any question tagged with fullmetal-alchemist-2003 is also about fma-series. Now, we obviously cannot correctly represent this ontology using Stack Exchange's current implementation of tags - but I don't know that this means we ought to turn to this alternate, hacky approach.
I know I harp on this, but it almost doesn't matter whether we pick the Japanese or English name if we (specifically you, moderators) just add the dag-blasted synonyms so that both of them show up when you type in a tag! 
That said, I do not think that a blanket policy of using English-language titles is necessarily desirable. For example, the English title for Hanasaku Iroha is "Blossoms for Tomorrow", but straight-up nobody calls it that. I can get on board with a concerted effort to move more things to English tags with Japanese synonyms, but there will be cases where we'll need to make exceptions to avoid stupid tag names.
It will be quite some time before enough questions use this new tagging approach for it to be useful for searching, favoriting, etc. If a shift to this approach is necessary and inevitable, then this doesn't matter, and we may as well get it over sooner than later. But I'm not convinced that it is either necessary or inevitable.




Consider this alternate proposal that 1.) mostly fixes the same core issue; 2.) avoids problems 2 and 5 from above; and 3.) gives us bonus features related to tag wildcards:

What if we abandoned franchise tags, and instead adopted consistent prefix schemes for tags that live in the same franchise? For example, instead of fma-series, we just have fma-brotherhood, fma-manga, fma-2003, fma-milos, and whatever else. For "metaverse" things like the Nasuverse, I think retaining separate tags for those is okay, though they should be used sparingly (e.g. when one has a question that necessarily draws on both Tsukihime and Fate or something). 

This, I believe, has the following advantages:


This is a more correct representation of the ontology of tags, though still not the one I would choose if I had the liberty to reimplement tagging from scratch.
We already have reasonably consistent prefixation for a number of these tags, meaning that the cutover to a fully consistent prefixation approach will not take nearly as long. Further, since this will involve tag renames rather than tag edits, it can be done non-disruptively using moderator tools, thus preventing gorillions of posts from being bumped to the front page as they are edited.
This is already the way a related problem is solved on Stack Overflow: versioned tags (python-2, python-2.7, python-3, python-3.4, etc). And as such, there is explicit support for this approach in search and when favoriting tags - use suffix wildcards like python-*. This is, in my opinion, the clearest advantage of a prefix-based scheme - we get to piggyback on all the stuff that has already been implemented for SO.




Slightly related note: about a year ago, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2427/should-we-allow-genre-meta-tags#comment4647_2432I offhandedly proposed the idea of introducing structured metadata into tag wikis to better represent the ontologies we're dealing with. I haven't given this much more thought since then, but it could be a fruitful avenue to investigate. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that many of the localized names are down right stupid, but a good portion do keep the Japanese romanization as part of their name. The full localized name of Hanasaku Iroha in English is "Hanasaku Iroha ~Blossoms for Tomorrow~" ("Blossoms for Tomorrow" would be regarded as more of a subtitle) the original name is preserved, so therefore we can keep the original tag as is. The same with Oreimo, which is also the English title. Some names like "Asobi ni Iku yo!" becoming "Cat Planet Cuties" is indeed questionable, so maybe limiting this change to popular tags only might be feasible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Furthermore, I concur that some of these changes are very hackish and tedious. These solutions are intended to be short-term solutions (because SE is not showing any signs of budging), of which the moderators (I will at least) will take on most of the burden of maintaining. I'll consider your suggestion about prefix scheme, as it's a much more viable alternative, that doesn't add as much clutter as the proposed franchise tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for stupid english names being stupid and almost unused in the circles.

the following question: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/35918/dragonball-gt-what-happens-if-re-grown-up-goku-turns-ssj4DBGT: Does Goku die of old age when he turns SSJ4 in the future? got closed for (in my opinion) very wrong reasons. It got closed for being "primarily opinion based". In the comments practically the only reason I got was "GT is not canon", which is obviously a load of bull. An anime is an anime, and within its own canon, it is most definitely canon.

Another comment I got was this:


  I think people downvoted your post because you are asking a question which answers can only be based on assumptions. Insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.


Well, I did. I literally had a header saying "the facts:" with a bullet list underneath it, stating the facts. (now updated to facts and references for clarity)

My question is most definitely based on things that are canon within the show and of which there are many references. My question is entirely based on things that actually happened in the show and there are no assumptions within it. Therefore I would like my question to be reopened. I don't see where the vote was coming from in any way except for bias against GT.

Thank you :)

Edit just to make something clear to whomever agrees with why my question got closed:
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6441/does-goku-become-the-dragon-itself-at-the-end-of-dragon-ball-gt?rq=1Does Goku become the dragon itself at the end of Dragon Ball GT? - a question with 5 upvotes even! It's been favourited, and hey, it explains even less than my question does! This question should be closed for being opinion-based!

-- I'll just stop here. Obviously I've made my point by finding all these questions that should have been closed even more than mine, in the recommended/related sidebar as top questions, within 1 minute. Anime.stackexchange is absolutely littered with these types of questions (Because otherwise there would be no need to ask them)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My question got closed unfairlyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An anime is an anime, and within its own canon, it is most definitely canon.    Erm...............circular logic much?


















Your question: What happens if this Goku, all grown up (again), turns SSJ4?

The only way to answer this is with an opinion. That's why it was closed. That's what the close reason means. Yes, you posted some facts in your question, but AFAICT, there isn't anything in those facts that support any type of conclusion. 

To quote the close reason description: "Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise." (emphasis added)

Sure, you can have one answer that says: "We don't know", but any other answer would be an opinion, unless the people who created the anime post something somewhere we can reference, or a DB GT2 gets created, or maybe it will be something in DB Super, but until that happens, you'll get crap answers, hence the close reason.

Your comment of most questions on anime.se are asked because they were never explained in the anime is based on flawed logic. You're disregarding people who didn't really watch the anime that closely, or lacked the cultural knowledge, or simply did not understand what was going on. Then there are works that are adaptations of some other media, and the adaptations are simply abridged versions of the original media. 

There are plenty of reasons why people would ask questions about a work even if it was explained in the anime. By your argument, people should never ask any questions about science or math or history, because its all written in the text books.

The questions you've listed are either outright answerable based on watching/reading dragonball or there is enough context to come to a conclusion, with the exception of one having a highly authoritative answer.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6441/does-goku-become-the-dragon-itself-at-the-end-of-dragon-ball-gt?rq=1Does Goku become the dragon itself at the end of Dragon Ball GT? -> He did not become a dragon. That's a fact, because if he did become a dragon, there would be something in the anime that shows he's a dragon.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4494/why-do-the-black-star-dragon-balls-exist?rq=1Why do the Black Star Dragon Balls exist? -> The question asks very specific things, and also had misunderstands which were able to be corrected. It is possible to answer the question because we can correct the initial misunderstandings. My memory of GT is a bit fuzzy, but I'm pretty sure it was explained in the anime, too

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/468/why-cant-pan-go-super-saiyan?rq=1Why can't Pan go Super Saiyan? -> this is an even better question, since the answer is based off of what the author had said.

Last two questions are related. It has been demonstrated time and again that hybrids are more powerful than pure saiyans. There is a strong indication that genetics play a roll, but its not explained exactly why. This predisposition for strength is reinforced with tools (sensu beans, hyperbolic time chamber) and knowledge, goku already became a super saiyan and its something that can be taught.

As I posted originally, if Toriyama decides to shed light on the issue, sure, by all means reopen it, but as it is, I don't see any reason why there would be any reasonable answer to this question based off of what's been showed on the anime.

And finally, this has nothing to do with anything, and is just my personal opinion, but your comments and the wording you've used come off as pretty hostile. Even if people agree with your logic, people will be less inclined to express agreement based on your tone. As the saying goes: you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar, and I see a lot of vinegar and very little honey. Since you have a decent amount of rep on SO, I think you're aware that most of the responses you've gotten have been pretty polite.

They get asked because they **never got explained in the anime**. Which is the reason why I have a question in the first place. As I have replied to the comment stating what you now stated in your answer; according to this logic, the anime section of stackexchange would be rendered futile. You demand me to ask a question that has been explained in the show? If it was, then why would I ask it? It would have already been answered!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've posted my response in the body of my answer. However, at this point, I think all I can say is that we'll have to agree to disagree. I'm just a user on the site, so nothing I say reflects the policies of the site itself. A mod will probably decide what to do with the question, I'm just explaining the reasoning as I see it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sorry for coming over hostile,  but I'm getting incredibly tired of this specific situation. It's extremely irritating. You say my question asks for an opinion, while it asks for an explanation in the form of a theory. An opinion would be given in a question like "Who would win a fight, naruto of luffy?" (an example handled by a lot of people) and then people would indeed use their opinions to judge. My question does not allow for opinions. You can't say "Oh, Goku undoes the dragon's wish when he goes SSJ4, but I find that to be stupid so it doesn't happen", because it's fact. That's why.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, and also, I happen to know about the "did Goku become one with the dragon?" question and you've interpreted it wrong, that's why you state that it's a valid question. It was never insinuated that Goku became a dragon so the anime did not have to show him becoming a dragon. It was insinuated that he became Shenron's guardian. That he became "one with" the dragon. A part of him, as his protector. Not that he became one himself. The top rated answer also doesn't deny or confirm that he became part of the dragon, so it's still up for discussion and the question was never answered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"9/10 answers on stackexchange are theories."  Can you prove this, or are you just postulating GASP your own opinion?  If there are things not explained in the anime or manga, go ask Toriyama-san.


















First of all, I agree that there are a few inconsistencies here and there in regards to whether or not an opinion based question. However, I believe your question is still off topic.

The primary reason for being opinion-based is because the answer is based on speculation and is hypothetical. "What if" something happened, can only be answered with guesses - some can be backed up by fact, but ultimately it is something that has not been addressed by the show. More extreme examples are "What if Naruto fought Luffy?" - you could provide information about how much they can both lift, or their skills, but ultimately it is based on the answerer's opinion.

http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/See this "Gorrilla Vs Shark" post for an explanation as to why these posts are discouraged 

Let me explain the reason why those other questions you note remain open:


Does Goku become the dragon itself at the end of Dragon Ball GT?


  This is looking for clarification on the ending of the show. Answers can be opinions alright, but an equally valid answer is that it is up to interpretation.

Why do the Black Star Dragon Balls exist?


  This is asking for the story behind a plot piece. It can be answered definitively, even if the answer is 'it was never revealed in the manga nor anime'. 

Why can't Pan go Super Saiyan?


  Similarly, this is asking to explain a story element. "It was never revealed why" is valid.

How did Goten and Trunks become Super Saiyan so easily?


  More story explanation

Are half-blooded Saiyans stronger than pure-blooded Saiyans? 


  Again, this can be answered with story citations.



Here are some examples that are more similar to your question:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/29537/what-if-a-pokeball-was-lost-and-couldnt-be-openedWhat if a pokeball was lost and couldn't be opened?

For this, we have had an old meta post:
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2282/are-question-that-are-slightly-hypothetical-but-with-potentially-great-answersAre question that are slightly hypothetical, but with potentially great answers dissallowed?

And the policy is generally:


  if the show has a coherent framework of rules from which we can make deductions. That said, shows like this are few and far between


There are no hard rules in the Dragonball. Akira even forgets some of the rules he put in at the beginning - where did all the tails go!?

So, this is our reasoning behind the community's closure - and I realise it seems inconsistent, but the other option is complete off-topic closure and regardless this question would be off-topic.

Please feel free to ask me any other questions :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure. I have another question for you :)
you state my question is more like "What if Naruto fought Luffy?" and the question "Does Goku become the dragon itself at the end of Dragon Ball GT?" is completely different, but you are, to put it plain and simple; wrong.

My question is **exactly** like the one about goku becoming the dragon itself, but with **more facts and references from the anime itself**. Here, let me rephrase my question for you: "Does Goku die of old age when he turns SSJ4 in the future?"  -- there. No more "what if". Now it's exactly like the other question. Find a flaw?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am clearly also asking for clarifaction on the ending of a show. My question is no different from "Does Goku become the dragon itself at the end of Dragon Ball GT?" at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Babydead I mean it's still a situation that doesn't happen in story right? you just changed the hypothetical scenario into claiming it happens. Something I would consider acceptable would be "What happens to Goku at the end of DBGT?" or "Does Goku ever turn SSJ4 again after DBGT?". I realise this is annoying and seems like trivial semantics, but we have to be consistent or the ambiguity will get worse.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It does seem like extremely trivial semantics, because although the situation itself never happened, a **similar** situation happened. (Goku aged as he turned SSJ4 in the first place). And going back to that, I again see absolutely no difference between ANY other question that asks something that didn't happen on the show. http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19497/was-broly-able-to-transform-into-super-saiyan-4-in-dragon-ball-z - this question wasn't closed. This never happened either.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I encouraged the OP to bring this to Meta because I didn't realize we were deciding on a series-by-series basis whether hypothetical questions were opinion-based, which seems bizarre to me. Yes, the rules in the Dragon Ball series are based on the rule of cool and constantly added and forgotten, but Sci-Fi and Fantasy has tons of Harry Potter questions where the answer turned out to be "JK Rowling sucks at math", so I don't know why we can't just let the question stay open and let the answer be "Akira Toriyama sucks at consistency".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(Though it wasn't actually him in this case since he didn't write GT.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/73476/if-goku-and-vegeta-fused-and-transformed-into-super-saiyan-god-would-you-need-a -- another great example. This question wasn't closed either. It has exactly the 'semantics' you describe. Although the answer kind of is an answer, it wasn't possible to be an answer until a year later when DBS came out. The question should've been closed according to your logic, but it wasn't.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/38979/if-the-namekians-can-create-an-extremely-powerful-dragon-why-couldnt-they-he - and another one. This one is even more like mine. It has way less direct references and facts to back it up, but it's there. Upvotes and all. It's a "what-if" situation answered with logic that actually makes sense. "Because Buu was more powerful than the dragon", which is literally a part of my question, only concerning Goku instead of Buu.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Babydead: Scifi is a separate site in the stack exchange network and is moderated differently.
@Torisuda I am going to open a policy discussion post, i encourage you both to share your opinions. I'm just relaying current policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was actually surprised to discover this policy when you mentioned it; I didn't realize we had an official policy about this, and I definitely will chime in on the discussion post as I really think we should revisit this; even if this specific question is ultimate deemed off-topic, I think that policy is too restrictive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sorry, but, here's another: http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/6305/how-can-one-tell-if-nappa-has-become-a-super-saiyan
this would be against your semantics once more, because it was never shown in the anime. It should've been closed then.
See? Your semantics don't seem to pan out. -- I quote you: "you just changed the hypothetical scenario into claiming it happens."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Babydead Toshinou-san is right that we can't expect the moderation and policies to be exactly the same between here and Sci-Fi. I brought it up as an analogous situation where allowing hypothetical questions worked. I understand that you're angry and I'm sorry this didn't work out the way I thought. We'll have to make our case on the other post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5btw, I would also love to join that discussion =)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Babydead please do. Also I will advise against lengthening this thread of comments any further - if you wish to continue the discussion feel free to visit our chatroom http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe- (though I have posted the other post now)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda I know :(.. you're very nice by the way haha. But I'm just looking for logic into what these people are claiming right now, because I see something countering their arguments on nearly every page they go, which is why I'm commenting so many different types of posts. You're quite right about having to make our case on the other post, because these 'semantics' seem to be very opinion- and situation based (ironically enough)


















Currently we have an unclear policy with regards to the limits of hypothetical questions, and with their increasing frequency on the site we should revisit this and solidify our rules.

Our policy is https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2282/are-question-that-are-slightly-hypothetical-but-with-potentially-great-answers?noredirect=1&lq=1vaguely outlined here in a mixture of suggestions with varying extents of strictness. a short summary is:


No cross-series hypothetical questions
"hypothetical questions about a show are fine if the show has a coherent framework of rules from which we can make deductions."


The latter is slightly more strict than what can be seen on other sites such as SciFi & Fantasy - https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6382/close-reasons-what-if-happenedthough their policy is subjective too.

Is the current policy sufficient? How do we solve cases of semantics https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3911/my-question-got-closed-unfairlysuch as this? Do we need to adjust our policy to be more lenient / more strict? 

Policies are user driven, so don't be afraid to suggest change :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Policy Discussion: When do hypothetical questions become opinion-based?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll come back with a more extensive write-up later, but for now I'll just say that I think our current policy was trying too hard to be objective, and ended up even more vague and subjective. We can argue forever about whether a given show has a "coherent framework of rules from which we can make deductions", but it's usually far more clear when an individual question can only be answered as "plot hole" or "we don't know".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel anyone like who doesn't actually know a lot about the anime (and thus can't know if there are any references and/or facts to back up a possible answer) should definitely refrain from voting on it. I myself for example purposefully avoid questions about subjects I don't know anything about, so I can't misjudge something that may be clear to others but not to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would like to see some examples which seem controversial. As far as I know, most of these questions are not something a common viewer would ask themselves and would want to search for on the internet. There are very rare examples, but those usually fall within the boundaries of our already existing strict rule (#2 in the summary).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion, we can't really make up strict policies on "off-topic"questions, since it is subjective to determine whether or not a question can have answers backed up by facts. Most of "What  if" question can't be answered objectively but each case is different and must be treated separatelyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ikaros I agree entirely. I actually think we should have a less strict policy and leave more room for community members to apply their knowledge and judgment. Actually, across the board, I'd like to see us move in a more permissive direction and away from really complicated polices that try to cover all the edge cases.


















Here are some guidelines I think we should adopt when dealing with hypothetical questions. http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/2015/06/gorilla-vs-shark-not-so-fast/Michael Edenfield's post on the Sci-Fi and Fantasy blog about this subject is a good read and helped inform my beliefs about how we should handle what-if questions.

Caveat: These are only guidelines. They aren't a formula that will always tell you whether a question should be closed. Use your judgment; if the guidelines are unclear on a question, but your experience suggests that any possible answer will be totally unsubstantiated, go with that. 

No cross-universe What-ifs

These are pretty much always opinion-based; they will almost inevitably involve some amount of pure guesswork or unfounded speculation.

Caveat: If there is an official crossover story between two universes, you can ask questions about things that might have happened in that story. For instance, I could ask the question "Does Kyousuke Kousaka think that Ruiko Saten is cute?", because there was in fact an official crossover story between Oreimo and To Aru Kagaku no Railgun. (The answer is yes, by the way.)

Caveat: The burden is always on the question asker to prove that an official crossover exists. If someone shows up asking "Could Naruto beat Luffy? I think they might have crossed over at some point", close the question unless the asker has evidence that they did cross over and might have fought.

What-ifs should be reasonably scoped

This can be tricky to determine if you're not intimately familiar with the series, but basically, any question that would demand an answer summarizing an entire alternate storyline the series could have taken is too broad. As an extreme example, "How would Lelouch's rebellion have gone if he'd never met CC and gotten his Geass?" That asks answerers to rewrite the entire series starting from the very beginning. Educated guesses supported by evidence from the series should be all right, but there is a point where you don't have enough evidence to do that anymore without leaving the realm of reasonable extrapolation.

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3917/7579Makoto's answer has a good set of guidelines to determine if a hypothetical question is reasonable in scope.

What-ifs should obviously relate to the story or the rules of the universe

I like Izkata's comment on the SF&F post that Toshinou-san linked: 


  Proposed close wording: "Okay, do you have any reason to think this aside from just pulling it out of your ass?"


Of course, we should be more polite than that. But it's reasonable to close a question for being irrelevant or silly or not asked in good faith. We should be able to close things like "What would happen if Motoko Kusanagi ate chili?", because Major Kusanagi eating chili is totally irrelevant to the story or the rules of the universe. (Unless it was strongly hinted at some point that eating chili might corrupt her boot sector and make her slaughter everyone, or something.)

I'm not in love with Death Note lawyer questions, but they relate to the rules of the universe, so they should be allowed. "Does L like chili?" shouldn't be allowed.

"Whatsit-san vs. Who-sama" questions

We get a fair number of these anyway, and I think we've been dealing with them pretty well; the really bad ones I've seen have all been closed. But for completeness, here are the guidelines I'd suggest for them, based on http://scifi.blogoverflow.com/2015/06/gorilla-vs-shark-not-so-fast/Michael Edenfield's blog:


Optimally, the characters should have fought at some point. No "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon here"; if the only way to answer is "Well, XX fought YY who fought ZZ who fought WW, and AA fought BB who fought CC who also fought WW and defeated him, whereas ZZ lost to WW, so going back up the chain, AA wins", it's primarily opinion-based. If you have good reason to think this is the case, vote to close.
If they haven't fought, use your judgment, but it's probably not looking good for the question. Lean towards closing, but you might ask the OP whether there was an actual scene that made them curious about this. Give extra scrutiny to cases where the characters, for in-universe reasons, never would fight; we might be able to figure out who would win if Sakura without her magic got in a fist fight with Tomoyo, but it would never happen, so the odds are very much against there being any evidence.
If the characters have never fought, but there are in-universe rules we could use to determine who might win (e.g. "100 Staryus vs. 100 Sandshrew: who wins?"—Staryu, because Ground is weak against Water), the question might be okay, depending on how thoroughly it sets up the scenario and how well the scenario conforms to known canon. But any question that would involve vague arguments about "power levels" or requires answerers to construct elaborate scenarios to answer ("Sandshrew would win because they can throw some desiccants at Staryu to dry up all its water it could buy some desiccants at the Pokemart") is opinion-based


"There's not enough information" or "It's a plot hole" should be valid answers, if the question conforms to the other guidelines

The tough thing about "there's not enough information" or "it's a plot hole" is that you never know if there's some interview or special edition one-shot floating around out there that answers the question, but a good-faith effort should be enough. It's not hard to tell when someone actually put some effort in to cover all the bases before writing the answer vs. when someone just plunked in "Nope, it was never explained, not that I remember". 

Answers with official evidence like interviews are best, of course.

Global Caveat: Use your Judgment

We can't cover every possible edge case, and bad questions have a tendency to be really weird. If something looks dodgy to you, go ahead and flag or vote to close. Throw it to the community to judge. 

If you vote to close a question and the OP just doesn't seem to understand why, I would encourage you to point them to Meta. Meta should be a place where people can debate individual decisions as well as overarching policy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to poke some fun in your 100 Staryu vs 100 Sandshrew question:  [Could 20 of the Sandshrew use Sunny Day?](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sunny_Day_(move))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto Sure, but then the 100 Staryu would just hire some Leaf Village Ninjas to throw them like shuriken, which would allow them to defeat the Sandshrew despite the power-sapping effects of Sunny Day. More seriously, if that question really showed up it should probably be closed. It was intentionally really annoying and borderline.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the image of a bunch of Sandshrews going to a Pokémart and buying Pokédesiccant. You have a way with words.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love how half the points somehow involve using your judgement and then you go on to finish with the global caveat of using your judgement.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jan I really wanted to get that point across.


















In my mind, there's no hard and fast rule to apply to any individual hypothetical question that could be asked about anime or manga, but there are a few heuristics we could apply to determine if they're suitable or not.

Notably, I'm looking for:


A specific timeline,
Some specific scenario in which any characters are involved in, and
A clear, unambiguous question.


This can vary depending on the requirements of the question (since, for whatever reason, the 100 Staryu vs. 100 Sandshrew question has piqued my interest, but in an annoying way), but in general, I would recommend use of the above heuristic to at least think about if a question should be closed.

Let's look back at an objective, straight-to-the-point sort of question.  https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/22249/102We can use this one for example.


  In the new manga mini-series, Sarada figures out the girl in glasses with Sasuke to whom Sarada seems to look like (the glasses, the face). I was wondering if maybe Sakura isn't her biological mother and that Sarada is a child of Sasuke and the other girl in picture.


Even if I'd like to spend a moment to edit this, this sort of question has a few key characteristics about it:


It mentions a specific timeline, either canonically or via publication (new mini-series for Naruto)
It describes a specific scenario that the characters (in this case, Sarada, Sakura, Sasuke and Karin ("girl in glasses")) are involved or related in
It states the question plainly, and leaves no room for ambiguity ("I was wondering if maybe Sakura isn't her biological mother...")


Based on that heuristic, I can reason that this sort of question can be answered, and even better, it could be answered with canonical source material backing up any claims.

Now, let's take a look at https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/35918/102another question which we could use as a benchmark for this heuristic.


Is there a specific timeline being offered?  In my mind, yes; the start and end of GT.
Is there a specific scenario in which the characters are involved in being discussed?  Yes; the scenario involves Goku regressing to the age of a child, whereas everyone else maintains their age.
Is there a clear, unambiguous question being posed?  Not really, because the question is open-ended in nature.  We are led to the end of the series by the question, then asked the hypothetical question here, emphasis mine.


  Goku is now walking around the tournament grounds, all grown up again in his base form, still having his tail (proving the wish wasn't reversed, because then his tail would have been gone) just before the end-credits come into play.
  
  ... What happens if this Goku, all grown up (again), turns SSJ4?



What makes this ambiguous is the fact that we're talking about this supposed, hypothetical Goku which may or may not take the state being described in the future, which makes this difficult to definitively answer.  A lot of theories could be thrown around about it, given the story of Dragon Ball GT, but theories aren't evidence, which makes me lean stronger towards questions like that being opinion-based.



So, what do we do in a scenario like that?  By and large the best thing to do is to close the question, which gives the OP a chance to edit their question and add disambiguating evidence or circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that their scenario could be realistic.  To Torisuda's point on crossovers, if that is a piece that is missing from the question, it should be pointed out.  The key here is to point that out, though, which I do feel like the previous Meta question which sparked this one did a really good job of doing.

Can questions like that be redeemed?  Some can; most cannot.  Pure, unbound hypotheticals aren't the sort of questions we should be allowing around here since they can get a little fantastical ("What would have happened had Itachi actually killed Sasuke when they were reunited?", "What would have happened had Rukia been executed?", ad nauseam).  However, if we keep 'em scoped well and emphasize how to get them on-topic, if possible, then I feel like it would work itself out rather well. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I really like this as a guideline for when the scope is reasonable, but I still have to disagree about that DBGT question. The question in the title, which was clearer in previous revisions, is _Will turning SSJ4 make Goku age to where he would have been if Ultimate Shenron's magic hadn't made him young?_ That in itself is a specific, reasonably scoped question about the rules of the universe. I think this is a case where "There's not enough information" is an acceptable answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda:  Actually yes, that does seem like a much less ambiguous sort of thing to be posing.  The ambiguity concern that I had was in context to some hypothetical Goku; if there's a version of the question that ties in more specifics like that instead of the hypothetical scenario, then I'd be alright with it, since it would fulfill my last heuristic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto but it's not a hypothetical Goku? I'm confused on that point. This Goku I spoke of, was in the anime.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto I made some edits to the DBGT question to make it more clear what was being asked. I've also nominated the question for reopening; as it sits, I think it reasonably fits all the guidelines in both of our answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda:  Thanks for letting me know.  I'm seeing something that's a lot more reasonable to answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda goddamn, do I love you man.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Babydead No problem. I had no idea I was kicking such a hornet's nest, but I'm glad your question was reopened.


















Amelia / Tomoe Mami


  
  Quite a lot of the activity on the site is concentrated around just a few shows: mainly Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and Death Note. While these are all fine shows, they hardly showcase the diversity of anime, and don't leave a lot for people who aren't fans of long-running action/adventure. What's your take on this situation? Is it fine as it is, or should the community strive for more diversity of topics—more shoujo, more older anime, more artsy/experimental material like Aku no Hana and Goodnight, Punpun? If you support more diversity, what steps would you take as a moderator to make it happen?
  


As a user, the easiest way to go about making it a little more diverse here is probably to just keep with the current season of anime and ask questions on anime.SE.

As a moderator (and as someone interested in community-building), you want to see more diverse questions; if every question on the site is about the same couple of fixed topics, you're going to start to have to close everything as a duplicate and then the site will start to stagnate.

The most popular series here are actually the mainstream anime for the 20-30 age bracket, and so I'd wager that's probably the average age of anime.SE users. People generally know their favourite anime well, and so a lot of content is posted here.

Considering just how much material exists, though, I'm fairly confident things will eventually even out.


  
  Last year we https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2564/1530asked the community about things they wanted to be clarified or fixed about our policies on Anime & Manga. This helped myself as the newly elected mod highlight some topics for review. One year on and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3903/lets-take-a-look-back-at-our-site-policies-2016-editiona new meta post later, Is there any particular policy the site currently has that you feel needs to be changed, or reviewed?
  


From frequenting other sites, I'd say the way that tags work here should probably be simplified properly.

People have a laser-like focus on doing an exact single-tag-per-post system, but that's not actually the way the system on stack exchange works. Rather than tagging https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemist-mangafullmetal-alchemist-manga (as an example), doing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fullmetal-alchemistfullmetal-alchemist https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fma-mangafma-manga (with a synonym for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fmafma) is a better use of the tagging system and makes things easier to find. This can also probably tackle the length limit effectively. This does, however, require heavy mod interaction for cleanup + synonyms + merging tags.

However, prefixed wildcard searches may possibly make this moot, though we'd have to start using abbreviated tags for anime in that case.


  
  Some Stack Exchange moderators are activists—they take a strong leading role in the community, bringing up issues, guiding discussions, suggesting policy, and creating initiatives. Others are more passive; they let other members of the community shape policy, enforce it less stringently, and wait in the wings for exceptional situations that require their unique abilities. The passive approach fits more with Stack Exchange's description of moderators as "glorified janitors" and "human exception handlers" as laid out in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation and other posts. However, activist moderators can be good for a site; they can help unite and guide a user base, and can ensure that a valid concern brought up by a significant minority of the community gets a fair hearing and doesn't get automatically ignored in favor of the majority view. As a moderator, would you be more of an activist, or would you take a more passive approach? Why? How would you recognize a situation that would benefit more from the opposite approach, and how would you deal with it?
  


I definitely default to a passive approach; I only get involved if I know/feel I have to, which is usually a mix of gut feeling, asking the other mods, or asking in the mod-only room.


  
  This year we have only had 7 Candidates nominated to join the mod team while last year there was 8 candidates. can you see any sort of barrier that would prevent other users from applying to become a part of the mod team in the next election? If so, in what way do you think we as a community can overcome this barrier? If not, what are your opinions as to why so few nominated to become a mod this time?
  


I'd say the people who are the most likely to actually be elected are already active chat users, but probably didn't want to take on the responsibility/commitment of being a mod this year. Quite a few people had to be convinced to put forward a nomination, and I nominated myself half hoping that it would encourage others to put their names forward, and half because I feel that, although I have a fairly low contribution to the site as a user, I do feel like I can contribute way more as a moderator.


  
  Last Year we had problems with Identification Requests with what should be done with them being asked of the candidates in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2537/1587last year's mod election. With the topic now dead, buried, covered in concrete and without a spoon to eat its way out is there another outstanding [single] subject that you think the community needs to address? why does this subject need to be addressed?
  


I don't really think there's anything that needs to be buried six feet under right this second.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


I've seen this exact thing happen on Freelancing, and myself and the other mods there keep a close eye on the user in question. I value their contributions, but on several occasions we've had to pull the user into (private) chat and explain to them that, while they may be a significant chunk of the questions and answers on the site, they still have to abide by the be nice policy and would face potential suspension if they continued.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


I'd ask them in chat what the reasons were; often-times perfectly good questions being closed are actually part of a clean-up from spammy users posting questions/answers to sock-puppet with. In those cases, dissociating the user is often a good way forward. For other reasons, it really does depend, but I don't undo another mod's actions without good reason and/or consensus.


  
  We have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2682/1587a number of community events from annual events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2684/1587Conspiracy Santa to one off events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2692/1587EU A&M Meet up. Are there any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation on the site?
  


I desperately want to actually attend a meetup with anime.SE, as during beta a bunch of us were actually planning to meet up for a vacation in akihabara, but I never actually got to go. I'm a fan of regular community meetups for stack exchange communities in general, as the smaller communities feel much closer than S[UFO] and the other large sites, so I'd probably try and get a UK or Ireland meet organised at some point.


  
  What's your opinion on Taisho posting images in site's main chatroom? Taisho's image posting did got criticized in the past for being unnecessary or for not being safe for office. So what you think in favor or against it?
  


I'm against it; I moderate in my spare time (sometimes at work), and I like to be on chat. I've actually nearly gotten in trouble because Taisho was posting while I was at work. I'm also not sure an imagebot has a place on chat.SE.


  
  What additional value would you add to the existing moderator team?
  


I'm an experienced mod with a level head who grew up with online anime communities. I'm also a better tomato than Toshinou Kyouko. And that's a fact.

I think that while image posting bots are uncommon on StackExchange, Taisho is a part/mascot of our chatroom. on 6: I'd recommend using modmail/mod warning thingy to respect the user's privacy more. (exact same case happened to me in my early days, a modmail warning helped me fix my behavior) on 10: Tosh is the best tomato and that's a fact. And can you extend it a bit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5on #2 - How exactly does SE tags work then? From what I understand, you breaking it up tags would result in meta tagging occurrences, which as fair as i know, is [strongly discouraged](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/). Especially in the example you gave, "manga" cannot adequately describe a single *valid* question on this site by itself (ie rule 1)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On #2, the tag system is designed to supplement the thing a user will be searching for, but is completely designed around the bigger sites (where you can have general categories, e.g. "sql"). For smaller sites, specific tags per post make sense if you use the prefix searching, but there is a character limit; once you start abbreviating tags, they become less searchable and start to be less useful as a tag. As for users tagging "anime" or "manga" on anything, "anime" is already blacklisted as it's the site's subdomain, but I still feel that "manga" is a content tag, not a meta one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An alternative to using [series-name] [manga] would be something like what SO does, (e.g. [php] [php-specific-thing], so [fullmetal-alchemist] [fma-manga] would be used).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ardaozkal: on #6, mods have the ability to create completely private chatrooms with only the participant(s) + mods + possibly stack employees present, and that's what we used. We felt it was a little lighter than a modmail and we could explain everything to the user in question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TomoeMami I am aware that they exist. Clarifying that you mean that on your answers can be a good idea though, I thought that you meant public chatrooms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5#4: Talking with you in chat and seeing that you'd put your name forward did help me decide to enter the race, so mission accomplished on that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On #9. Stack Exchange gives a degree of freedom how to it's communities. There are obvious criteria communities should focus on in order to be sustainable, but how we develop from there is up to the community as a whole. The formula for other SEs won't necessarily work with this one. Anime has always been NSFW and it's never going to change. We're a recreational SE, we don't have to fit a mold, because unlike the other more serious SE, we're here to have fun.


















Hereby my point of view on the following items ~dimitri-mx~


  
  Quite a lot of the activity on the site is concentrated around just a few shows: mainly Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and Death Note. 
  While these are all fine shows, they hardly showcase the diversity of anime, and don't leave a lot for people who aren't fans of long-running action/adventure. 
  What's your take on this situation? Is it fine as it is, or should the community strive for more diversity of topics—more shoujo, more older anime, more artsy/experimental material like Aku no Hana and Goodnight, Punpun? If you support more diversity, what steps would you take as a moderator to make it happen?
  


As [YAS](your anime sucks) once mentioned "For us to make jokes reasonable, at least half the audience should know the anime. Obscure/old is good, but don't expect everybody to like, let alone know it." - Abunaicon '15/'16
The same count's for Q&A. If less people watch it, less people will know the answer, and less questions will pop up. This is a contrast we clearly see on A&M on an almost daily basis. I do not see this as a bad thing perse,
as this is where most people's questions will originate from. Therefore I think it is fine as is. 

However, we as a community can strive to become a bit more difference. There have been several viewing circles before, where anime was watched together. In these viewing circles questions can be brought to light, and people with more experience in asking question, could help users whom might not know how to properly phrase their question. This will reduce the beginner bar, and help us diversify content. 

TL:DR It is fine as it is, however, we as a community can create more diversity by participating together.


  
  Last year we https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2564/1530asked the community about things they wanted to be clarified or fixed about our policies on Anime & Manga. 
  This helped myself as the newly elected mod highlight some topics for review. 
  One year on and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3903/lets-take-a-look-back-at-our-site-policies-2016-editiona new meta post later,
  Is there any particular policy the site currently has that you feel needs to be changed, or reviewed?
  


Most of he policies are pretty clear cut and don't really need any mayor improvements in my eyes as of now. Personally I am more interested to see how other people think about the policies and how we should improve them. And would love to think as a community about them.

However we do have some lingering aftermath of the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request. Such as the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic ID-requests that we still do. Personally I think that a policy should be established to ensure maintainability, and last ability of the questions, as it wouldn't be the first time that a linked video has gone missing and no time stamp/ episode was given.


  
  Some Stack Exchange moderators are activists—they take a strong leading role in the community, bringing up issues, guiding discussions, suggesting policy, and creating initiatives.
  Others are more passive; they let other members of the community shape policy, enforce it less stringently, and wait in the wings for exceptional situations that require their unique abilities.
  The passive approach fits more with Stack Exchange's description of moderators as "glorified janitors" and "human exception handlers" 
  as laid out in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation and other posts. 
  However, activist moderators can be good for a site; they can help unite and guide a user base, and can ensure that a valid concern brought up by a significant
  minority of the community gets a fair hearing and doesn't get automatically ignored in favor of the majority view. As a moderator, would you be more of an activist, or would you take a more passive approach?
  Why? How would you recognize a situation that would benefit more from the opposite approach, and how would you deal with it?
  


As a moderator I don't think you can really classify yourself as passive or active, as a balance in both is definitely required. But as a person I would hint towards the passive approach. SE is a community driven, this means that the people in it should have the possibility to voice their opinion, bring up issues and suggest policies them selves.

Here we, the moderators can guide our users to a consensus and help them the the pro's and con's of it. This however will occasionally require use moderators to take a stance, or make a decisions and act upon this.

Some situations however can only be handled upon by moderators, and will therefore require a moderator to take a active stance. This is something I believe reflects fairly well in the way a moderator handles flags and the likes.


  
  This year we have only had 7 Candidates nominated to join the mod team while last year there was 8 candidates. 
  can you see any sort of barrier that would prevent other users from applying to become a part of the mod team in the next election?
  If so, in what way do you think we as a community can overcome this barrier? If not, what are your opinions as to why so few nominated to become a mod this time?
  


I think there is indeed some barrier. The first time I ran for moderator (given that it was joke worthy) I did not have the feeling I would even have a snowball's chance in hell. The other people were way more versed in how the community, site and other SE communities worked. They looked like veterans in my eyes. And why sign up for a losing battle? Or fear that would would not do it correctly anyway.

SE in general has a bit of an elitist feel, and I think that moderators often subconsciously reflect this as well. Not because they want to be, all though they sometimes definitely do (hinting to SO mods). This all together might scare off other people, or make them feel less qualified for the job. Hence leaving it in the hands of somebody else.

On a side note. A downgrade from 8 to 7 participants, considering there are less positions available this time is not so much of a regression. But more of a progression in my eyes. 


  
  Last Year we had problems with Identification Requests with what should be done with them being asked of the candidates in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2537/1587last year's mod election. 
  With the topic now dead, buried, covered in concrete and without a spoon to eat it's way out is there another outstanding [single] subject that you think the community needs to address? 
  why does this subject need to be addressed?
  


I don't believe that there are currently any dilemmas as big as the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request. But I do believe that some of the after math of it needs some clearing up. 
Even after the removal of id requests, we still see a lot of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic identification requests. Personally I believe some guidelines would be in place here, as it wouldn't be the first time that a YouTube video was provided, which was removed just as fast as the question was posted.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


I would start of by attending the user on it's behavior, and how it is not in line with our https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/240839/259147be-nice-policy, either through chat, comments or other viable solutions. If this does not work more drastic measure might have to be taken. But unless it is really clear cut vandalism/profanity, I do consider discussing it along with other moderators, or if necessary even members first. 


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


I would contact the moderator in question and ask him too explain his motives, either through the chat, or meta posts. Which is not that different from what I did as a regular user either. The freedom to question such things is not only for moderators.


  
  We have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2682/1587a number of community events from annual events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2684/1587Conspiracy Santa
  to one off events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2692/1587EU A&M Meet up.
  Are there any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation on the site?
  


Yes, I would love to see more community events, and help out with organizing them. And as much as I would like to see more events such as the EU meet up, I also understand it is hard/expansive considering everybodies daily life's
 and the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2501/1458many places we come from. non the less, I have plenty of ideas for annual events, both remotely located and physically located which fall within reasonable limits for most of us.
 But I guess I could even dedicate a whole meta post too this in itself, which I will actually do some time soon.


  
  What's your opinion on Taisho posting images in site's main chatroom? 
  Taisho's image posting did got criticized in the past for being unnecessary or for not being safe for office.
  So what you think in favor or against it?
  


As a NSFW victim, I think Taisho is a cool guy. As long as my boss ain't near.
His images can be a bit intrusive, but they ain't a nuisance as of yet. 
Hence I am in favor of keeping him.


  
  What additional value would you add to the existing moderator team?
  


All though I have not moderated on SE sites before, I have moderated on several fora before. With a clear grasp on whats going on by lurking around all day I hope to improve our community, and act upon violations swiftly.

Hello, senshin here.

If you support more diversity, what steps would you take as a moderator to make it happen?
  


It is a somewhat unfortunate fact of life that long-running action/adventure shows lend themselves to SE-style questions far more easily than most other types of shows. (This is only unfortunate insofar as it would be unfortunate if any small collection of shows were disproportionately "good" at giving rise to questions.)

Something should be done about this. I admit that I don't have a good idea of specific interventions that would be effective here. As a regular user, I make a deliberate effort to ask questions about things that are not frequently asked about, but that only goes so far. I'm going to try out a variant on my old "bounties for tags" idea this coming month, and if that works, huzzah, but I don't have my hopes up.

I don't think that this is a problem that is likely to resolve itself naturally. "ActionAdventureAnime.SE" would probably be a stable equilibrium, and it's one that we might currently be heading towards (I haven't looked at the data; this is just gut-feel for now). I think it will take effort to ensure that we end up at an equilibrium that more closely reflects the overall demographics of "people who have questions about anime".

What, then, would I do specifically as a moderator? I'm not really sure (aside, again, from enjoying the extra gravitas afforded by a diamond when one leads by example). https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2831/Torisuda's recent proposal for "viewing circles" seemed like a great idea to me, and I would definitely be willing to put some time in to get something similar up and running.

The series-tags thing that Torisuda brought up https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3904/here is reasonably important to discuss, and I've already given my thoughts on it over https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3907/here. Other than that, nothing really pressing comes to mind. For the most part, our policies seem reasonably good and reasonably stable at this point.

How would you recognize a situation that would benefit more from the opposite approach, and how would you deal with it?
  


At our current size, any four moderators are inevitably going to constitute a large fraction of "people who contribute heavily to meta discussions". I think the site is better-off today - though perhaps not in the far future - if all our moderators (including myself, if elected) are reasonably "activist". Krazer's "activism", in particular, has historically led to a number of positive outcomes; I see this as desirable for the well-being of the site.

The "glorified janitors" line has always made perfect sense on SO, where the primary function of a moderator is to janitorialize things that the community cannot or does not. Here, where the moderators are scarcely even necessary for janitorial tasks? Not so much.


  
  This year we have only had 7 Candidates nominated to join the mod team while last year there was 8 candidates. can you see any sort of barrier that would prevent other users from applying to become a part of the mod team in the next election? If so, in what way do you think we as a community can overcome this barrier? If not, what are your opinions as to why so few nominated to become a mod this time?
  


I see no barriers to nominating oneself for modship. 7 is not much smaller a number than 8. In fact, 7 divided by 1 is considerably larger than 8 divided by 3. Arithmetic!


  
  Last Year we had problems with Identification Requests with what should be done with them being asked of the candidates in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2537/1587last year's mod election.

With identification requests gone, there are no immediate existential threats to the site. This is good. 

There is still a longer-term threat to the well-being of the site: what if we get so many questions on Naruto and its ilk that they dominate the front page? At some point, this becomes self-reinforcing - who would want to visit a site full of Naruto questions, other than someone who already likes Naruto? (I'm not saying that this state of affairs is an inevitability; merely that it is a possibility - and one that I think is not even all that likely. Nonetheless, it behooves us to think about the this possibility and mitigate this risk where possible.)

Obviously, we cannot and should not ban Naruto questions, as we did id-reqs. So we need a different approach to ensuring that this doesn't become Naruto.SE - and that approach is to encourage diversity of content. See question #1 in this post.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Same as https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2542/last time: we are still in a place where valuable content is worth enough that I think we ought to mop up after argumentative users who write good posts. I maintain that I would probably do no more than tell the user to tone it down, either in comments or in chat. 


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Also same as last time: post about it on meta for discussion. Unilateral closures and deletions of reasonable posts are still not a problem we have, so this is hardly a thing that happens anyway.


  
  We have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2682/1587a number of community events from annual events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2684/1587Conspiracy Santa to one off events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2692/1587EU A&M Meet up. Are there any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation on the site?
  


I have no interest in coordinating or otherwise being involved in "real-life" events. I don't object to them on principle or anything; they're just not my cup of tea. I prefer to keep my internet life and non-internet life fairly separate.


  
  What's your opinion on Taisho posting images in site's main chatroom? Taisho's image posting did got criticized in the past for being unnecessary or for not being safe for office. So what you think in favor or against it?
  


I imagine I've been one of the primary complainants here. To be clear - I guess I'm okay with Taisho posting images in the chatroom (though I don't see the point of it - I think it just clutters up the chatlog and makes us look like weirdos). It's just that keeping Taisho around will keep me out of the Maid Cafe most of the time. 


  
  What additional value would you add to the existing moderator team?
  


I will create so many tag synonyms. Please. I want tag synonyms. Let me have this. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5#8 - Community events do not have to be "real-life" events. Thus you haven't really answered the underlying question -- to affect the activity in a positive way, online only, if you prefer.


















The rules

If you create a tag for any series, franchise, person, or organization, I will award you a 50-reputation bounty, provided that:


The question that creates the tag is posted during the month of September 2016 (in any time zone).
The question receives a net score of at least +1 by October 7, 2016, and isn't closed or deleted.
You have posted at least one answer on the site (to any question whatsoever) with a score of at least 0. (Bounties can only be awarded to answers, not questions.)
The tag is for a series, franchise, person, or organization. If you create a tag that is none of those, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/anime-productionanime-production, you will not receive a bounty.
You have less than 20,000 reputation at the time of this posting. (This excludes Krazer / Jon Lin / me / Toshinou Kyouko / Logan M. We all have enough reputation as is.)


If you do not have https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsenough reputation to create a tag (150 rep), that's fine - post the question anyway with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag, and somebody will come by and make a tag for you. I will give you (rather than the higher-rep user who physically creates the tag) the bounty.

There is no limit on how many bounties you can earn (unless you bankrupt me of reputation, in which case I guess it's first-come-first-serve). 



Supplementary note: The previous batch of bounties-for-tags (Feb-May 2015) was less effective than I would have hoped. This might be because the bounties were conditional on the tags being in some prescribed category (https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2227/proposal-bounties-for-tags#comment3116_2227at the time, it seemed like a good idea to me). This time, I'm going for a mostly unconditional approach, in hopes that this will get people to ask more questions. This might work, or it might not. We'll see.

Striving to fit into something to me seems, artificial. Instead, let the questions we have be about the anime we like to watch. Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Death note, are all very popular examples of anime, and thus we see lots of questions being asked about them. With the exception of Death Note, these are all very long running shows which have vast universes, and many questions can arise over the span of their thousands of combined episodes. I don't see it as wrong for there to be more questions in a certain category just because they are more popular.


Last year we https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2564/1530asked the community about things they wanted to be clarified or fixed about our policies on Anime & Manga.

I agree with Krazer about our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3908/17758spoiler policies being inconsistent. For instance: is a spoiler in the title OK? Well, if it's the "best" way to write the title then yes. If it would otherwise make the title ambiguous, then yes. What about spoiler tags? This is pretty much left to poster discretion, or the community to edit in later if someone feels they don't like it.
We should decide where we stand as a community about spoilers. One side of hurting search indexing of posts while keeping the site spoiler-free or the other side of possibly upsetting some of the community. Concreting this would allow us to be very up front to new users about what to expect on our site, and what cautions to take.


Some Stack Exchange moderators are activists—they take a strong leading role in the community, bringing up issues, guiding discussions, suggesting policy, and creating initiatives. Others are more passive; they let other members of the community shape policy, enforce it less stringently, and wait in the wings for exceptional situations that require their unique abilities. The passive approach fits more with Stack Exchange's description of moderators as "glorified janitors" and "human exception handlers" as laid out in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation and other posts. However, activist moderators can be good for a site; they can help unite and guide a user base, and can ensure that a valid concern brought up by a significant minority of the community gets a fair hearing and doesn't get automatically ignored in favor of the majority view. As a moderator, would you be more of an activist, or would you take a more passive approach? Why? How would you recognize a situation that would benefit more from the opposite approach, and how would you deal with it?


I much prefer the sense of community responsibility that StackExchange provides over the traditional experience that we find in an internet forum. Everyone here works together, and gives input on what they want out of this site. We all work together to keep the site clean, and to help new users learn to use the site.
I appreciate this fact, and would like to keep it as autonomous as possible. I don't think that a moderator should be necessary at all for change to take place in the community, or for concerns to be addressed within our meta. I believe, that this is even more true because of the smaller size of our StackExchange community.
I favor the moderator position to be viewed as outlined in the theory of moderation blog post, as an elected janitor, handling issues that fall outside the norm.


This year we have only had 7 Candidates nominated to join the mod team while last year there was 8 candidates. can you see any sort of barrier that would prevent other users from applying to become a part of the mod team in the next election? If so, in what way do you think we as a community can overcome this barrier? If not, what are your opinions as to why so few nominated to become a mod this time?


I would have preferred that this election be much bigger, with several more candidates in mind. I know each person has some individual reasons, but I can only share my own reservations. I know that Krazer has invested countless hours into this position and I respect the amount of work that he's put into helping out everyone in our community. The investment in time is valuable, as everyone has their own lives and busy schedules. I'm relieved there is another moderator spot opened to help distribute some of that existing work around a bit.
I haven't talked to Madara or our Tomato very much outside of the Maid Cafe, but I have come to understand that this reservation holds true even for our existing moderation.
To answer your question of why so few candidates have nominated themselves, I don't believe this is unusual at all. If we look at a normal meta thread about changing some policy, or a discussion about our site, we will notice that these topics don't generate huge numbers of participation. It's generally the same group of faces that you'll see in each thread. I would not expect participation in a moderator election to be much different from those results.
I appreciate the efforts of community members such as Torisuda who have stepped up in recent times to keep our Meta thriving, and I believe that continuing to bring up topics in our Meta is what will drive future interest in community events, elections, and discussion about our site.


Last Year we had problems with Identification Requests with what should be done with them being asked of the candidates in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2537/1587last year's mod election. With the topic now dead, buried, covered in concrete and without a spoon to eat it's way out is there another outstanding [single] subject that you think the community needs to address? why does this subject need to be addressed?


I'm happy that we came together and figured out that identification request questions weren't a good fit for our site. I don't have similar strong feelings about changing another feature on the site at this time.


How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?


Immediately, users come to mind that aren't exactly patient, friendly people. Particularly theres some animosity towards newer, inexperienced users of our site. Both these older members and the new, inexperienced users are valuable to our site. I appreciate the "be nice" policy at Stack Exchange, and I do feel like it's often forgotten. I think that we as a community should call out users when we see them speaking to others in a way that we would find rude in real life. I hope we wouldn't let that happen in the real world.  Let's not use the fact that this is an internet powered discussion as a reason for us to be allowed to be mean to others.
Basically, communication is the first step in resolving any problem that we come across. It would only be in regrettable circumstances would a moderator need to take any action past that.


How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?


I would first try to see if I could understand their perspective on my own. If I still felt strongly that their action was incorrect, then I would chat with them about their reasons, and work together to see if there was a mututal agreement that could be reached. If no agreement could be reached after that, then I believe that this issue is not as cut-and-dry as it first might have seemed and is better off handled by the community on a meta post than by a single moderator.


We have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2682/1587a number of community events from annual events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2684/1587Conspiracy Santa to one off events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2692/1587EU A&M Meet up. Are there any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation on the site?


Personally, what was truly the glue holding me to this community was the organized simulatenous watch parties (using Rabb.it) that Krazer would host. While we haven't had these in a few months, to me they were what an anime community is really all about. We were doing the thing we already know we all love, watching anime.. together. It always generated a few new questions per session and we had a lot of fun together chatting and making jokes during the sessions.
I know these aren't for everyone and the schedules can't work for everybody, but I think that these events are where we're really doing what we love doing and with people that share those interests. Having Anime & Manga as a platform for that is great, because new people can always join at any time and that means you're getting new perspectives with each show you watch.


What's your opinion on Taisho posting images in site's main chatroom? Taisho's image posting did got criticized in the past for being unnecessary or for not being safe for office. So what you think in favor or against it?


I have no problems with Taisho and from what I've seen, the complaints are unfounded. We have a question here on A&M about why anime is considered weird porn by western culture, and I'd say this lines up with the flags that Taisho has received. People on other parts of the network don't necessarily understand our culture, pop into the chat room, and have culture shock.


What additional value would you add to the existing moderator team?


I will continue being an active member of this community whether or not I become a moderator for A&M. The extra responsibilities of moderation would merely be a way for me to assist the existing moderation in keeping the site maintained. I would be happy to contribute to any plans the community has for adjusting the site in any way those priveleges made possible.

Fixed that now, thanks for taking care of me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5#9 So didn't we should care about SE culture too and also make main chatroom more friendly for outsider ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnkitSharma As a recreational site I wouldn't like for us to take away things that make us recreational and fun.

The solution isn't removing Taisho but going through and cleaning up borderline content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding your answer to question 9: though I understand that you're trying to make the point that "anime is perceived as weird by outsiders", I'd caution towards falling into the "room culture" argument — new users are not expected to read the transcript or anything similar when they first come into a room, mods view flags without context, and the "be nice" policy is transverse to all the sites in the network, regardless of culture. See [this discussion](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/270587/208518) for some more thoughts on this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Thank you for the link to the discussion. I have read through it once before, and align with it. I do think that Taisho is a part of our culture here, but not in the negative way that "room culture" is perceived. It is true that we get flags because people think that posting anime images into a stack exchange chat is inappropriate. I've gone into other chats and seen them talking about it. However, even without Taisho, we would still have our community posting anime pictures into the chat that they want to share.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think that anyone is going against the "be nice" ideal by posting the pictures they like into the Maid Cafe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you said our community posting anime pictures, while it's true I think the problem lies on fact that it is a bot that posting pictures. You can banned user for saying f word every 10 second but he will reappear again sooner or latter, with bot, you can actually stopped him for good, without any problem


















In Which Torisuda Answers the Mod Questions in the Customary Long-Winded Manner


  
  Quite a lot of the activity on the site is concentrated around just a few shows: mainly Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and Death Note. While these are all fine shows, they hardly showcase the diversity of anime, and don't leave a lot for people who aren't fans of long-running action/adventure. What's your take on this situation? Is it fine as it is, or should the community strive for more diversity of topics—more shoujo, more older anime, more artsy/experimental material like Aku no Hana and Goodnight, Punpun? If you support more diversity, what steps would you take as a moderator to make it happen?
  


This was my question. I asked it before I decided to run, and I thought it was important for the candidates to address because I do think we could use more diversity of material. Anime is so much more than just long-running shounen action. There are anime full of beautiful writing and rich symbolism, anime that push the boundaries of animation as a medium, anime that are strange and truly original enough to rival the most underground of underground comix and the most independent of independent movies. There are genres that have no equivalent in the West. There are anime which are all of those things.

Our site, because of Stack Exchange’s content curation policies, is uniquely well suited to introduce people to this wider world of anime. Stack Exchange is designed to attract experts. In the context of anime, this will usually mean people well-versed in art, literature, film, Japanese language, and other culture areas. We do have such experts here, but I’ve noticed that many of them, not being attracted to the popular shows, don’t have enough questions to answer and can’t hope for a response if they ask their own, so they gravitate towards moderation as a way to keep engaged with the site. We need good people moderating the content, but it’s sad that we can’t find more ways for these experts to contribute valuable content. I look at more diversity as the first step to realizing the full potential of our community.

I tried to stimulate more diversity of content with https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2831/7579Proposal: Let's form viewing circles!. People seemed pretty underwhelmed, and looking back, there were some flaws in that proposal. But from interactions I’ve had with other users, there does seem to be an appetite in the community for more diversity; it’s just a question of finding the right stimuli, the right incentives. I don’t know yet what those are, but I’ve got a hundred ideas and I’d like to try them all.


  
  Last year we https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2564/1530asked the community about things they wanted to be clarified or fixed about our policies on Anime & Manga. This helped myself as the newly elected mod highlight some topics for review. One year on and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3903/lets-take-a-look-back-at-our-site-policies-2016-editiona new meta post later, Is there any particular policy the site currently has that you feel needs to be changed, or reviewed?
  


Nothing urgent. There are a few rough edges to sand down. This is an area where I prefer to take more of a passive role and wait for issues to arise naturally; I like to leave a few escape hatches in policies to allow for flexibility.

There are a few things like tagging continuities and spoiler policies that we should talk about, but as my product manager says, "These are problems we want to have"—they mean that, as a community, we've moved past the adolescent identity crisis and come to the college years.


  
  Some Stack Exchange moderators are activists—they take a strong leading role in the community, bringing up issues, guiding discussions, suggesting policy, and creating initiatives. Others are more passive; they let other members of the community shape policy, enforce it less stringently, and wait in the wings for exceptional situations that require their unique abilities.

As a moderator, would you be more of an activist, or would you take a more passive approach? Why? How would you recognize a situation that would benefit more from the opposite approach, and how would you deal with it?
  


This was also my question from before I was running, and I asked it because across the SE network, I've seen activist mod teams, I've seen passive mod teams, and I've seen mixed mod teams, and I've seen all of them work and not work.

If elected, I expect to be more on the activist side. Both our pro-tem mod team and our current mod team are more on the activist side, and I feel it's worked well for our community to have them out on the front lines engaging with people. They've been instrumental in organizing events, guiding the community through large and difficult policy decisions, and explaining to new users why Stack Exchange can feel so unfriendly at first. The site is at a place where it doesn't need quite so much activist moderation, but it's not yet at a place where the mods can afford to disappear from view and spend all their time cleaning up messes behind the scenes.

On the other hand, one lesson I've learned in my time on SE is that I don't need to be involved in every decision that gets made and every discussion that goes on. Sometimes, mods should stay out of it and let the community decide. The more dysfunctional activist mod teams I've seen (not going to name any names, but it’s not ours) are the ones that can't do this; they have to offer criticism of one kind or another on every single post. It reminds me of an obnoxious professor I had in college; he would come to every post in our class forum, gleefully nitpick typos, mock our troubles, offer no help at all, and off he went.

As a mod, I would be cognizant of my ability to insta-close and insta-delete, and leave decisions on borderline posts up to the community. If I disagreed with the community decision, I would generally express that through a discussion on chat or Meta, not by unilaterally reversing the decision with mod powers. Mods should avoid the impression that they’re hand-sculpting the site into their own personal police state; being hands-off sometimes is the best way to do that.


  
  This year we have only had 7 Candidates nominated to join the mod team while last year there was 8 candidates. can you see any sort of barrier that would prevent other users from applying to become a part of the mod team in the next election? If so, in what way do you think we as a community can overcome this barrier? If not, what are your opinions as to why so few nominated to become a mod this time?
  


Our community has a small, very committed core of users who take active parts in moderation and policy. This is a bit intimidating to a potential moderator candidate; when I was considering running, I knew every decision I made as both a candidate and a mod would be reviewed by a group of people who really know their stuff and wouldn't be afraid to call me out. When I realized this was actually an advantage--if I ever made a wrong decision, there would be people to check me and straighten things out--I decided to go for it.

But I'm also not sure why so many people waited until the last minute to slide in their nominations :) I understand it takes time to decide to run, but declaring your nomination so late took away a chance for the community to question you directly and discuss your candidacy. 


  
  Last Year we had problems with Identification Requests with what should be done with them being asked of the candidates in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2537/1587last year's mod election. With the topic now dead, buried, covered in concrete and without a spoon to eat it's way out is there another outstanding [single] subject that you think the community needs to address? why does this subject need to be addressed?
  


Not really. Even though Anime and Manga has "graduated" (and where's our new site design, SE? Don't you love us anymore?), we still have some growing pains to work through, but I don't see a single outstanding issue that needs to be addressed, just lots of little things.

If you had asked me several months ago, I would have said "our community's war machine mentality". Things were bleak in the immediate aftermath of the id request ban. For about a month, we had very few questions, almost no answers, downvotes everywhere, and it felt like every single question that came in had close votes against it. But we've moved past that, our Robespierre-like tendencies have been reined in, and the last month has been vibrant and fun, with several promising new users joining us. The only complaint I have left is that most of the activity has been in popular tags.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Assuming the comments were not abusive or offensive, merely argumentative, I would first try to get in touch with that user and let them know that a lot of people seem to be taking their comments the wrong way. I would assume good intentions and just ask the person to read their comments twice before posting, to be sure it was getting across the intended meaning.

I would also take this opportunity to let them respond and add more context to the situation. When I was in middle school, I knew someone who got in trouble for violence and angry outbursts on a pretty regular basis. None of the adults knew that he was being goaded and verbally harassed until he lost his temper and lashed out. Sometimes authority figures need to listen to someone to find out what's really going on, instead of assuming everything is just as it appears.

If the user was at fault, and the argumentative behavior continued, I would give the user another warning, worded a little more sharply: going from "Hey, I noticed people seem to be taking your comments the wrong way, can you be a little more careful with your wording?" to "Remember our previous talk? It doesn't seem to be improving. You need to try harder to hold back a little."

Depending on how the user responded to the previous outreach, I might give them a third chance, strongly warning that they are close to a suspension. If the user responded badly or escalated the situation, I might go straight for a short suspension at this point. Continued refusal would be met with longer suspensions.

If the comments were abusive or offensive, the first message would be much sharper and things would proceed more quickly. No one has the right to abuse other users, no matter how many good answers they’ve written. 


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Starting a mod war is definitely the wrong way to handle the situation. I would start by asking the other mod, in chat or in comments, to explain the reasoning behind the decision they made. If I felt the question was truly borderline and the other mod’s reasons seemed sound, I would probably leave it there, even if I didn’t entirely agree; these decisions are usually not clear-cut, and sometimes you have to trust your colleague’s judgment, even if it’s not exactly what you would have done yourself. Also, if the community feels the question is valuable, they can override a mod’s decision by voting to reopen/undelete; if that didn’t happen, it would indicate that the other mod made the correct decision from the community’s point of view. 

On the other hand, if I felt the question was not borderline, that it fell into an undefined area of our policy, or that the other mod made the decision for unsound reasons, I would probably confer with the entire mod team and start a discusson on Meta to allow the community to have input. 


  
  We have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2682/1587a number of community events from annual events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2684/1587Conspiracy Santa to one off events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2692/1587EU A&M Meet up. Are there any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation on the site?
  


Recently I’ve become a big fan of https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFWHlH4koGZDABLg4i81lswPJPHqLdKj7Screen Junkies Movie Fights. It’s a game show where people who love movies answer debate questions like “Pitch the next Wolverine movie”, “Best Quentin Tarantino movie”, “Most traumatizing kids movie”, and even “Which superhero would win the Hunger Games?” The host judges answers based on the quality of the arguments, and there’s a fact-checker to make sure people don’t get away with making things up. It’s a lot of fun to watch, and I think it would be even more fun to play an anime/manga version.

I envision this as a Meta event with accompanying chat events. Some topic ideas I came up with were "Choose a relatively serious anime and pitch a magical girl spinoff starring one of the characters, in the style of Pretty Sammy or Prisma Illya", "What genre should get a Madoka-style deconstruction next and what would the show be like?", and "You've just read the title Boku no Real Love Napkin in a forum; what do you imagine is the plot of this show?" I’ve worked out how we could organize it, and I’ll be happy to jump in chat one of these evenings and talk about it if anyone is interested. It would be a great opportunity for us to get creative, have fun, get some of those “X vs Y?” questions out of our systems, and plumb the depths of our anime knowledge, and as a bonus, we could outsource the fact-checking to the main site by asking questions on anything in doubt.

I also think topic challenges like Worldbuilding, Movies and TV, and Writing do could be interesting. I’d envision it as similar to the tag bounty challenges that senshin was issuing, where we choose a theme, but the question could be in any tag with that theme, not just new tags. We could do it without a bounty like Worldbuilding does, or high-rep users could offer bounties to the top voted posts.

Both of these events would spur more diversity of content by encouraging us all to look outside of our favorite show or favorite genre.


  
  What's your opinion on Taisho posting images in site's main chatroom? Taisho's image posting did got criticized in the past for being unnecessary or for not being safe for office. So what you think in favor or against it?
  


I don’t have a problem with it. I don’t have time at work to be in chat anyway; I have work to do at work :)

More seriously, Taisho is a beloved part of Maid Cafe, but I can understand where he might be problematic in a work setting. If this is a problem for enough people, we could look into doing a review of the images he posts to make sure they're all reasonably SFW. You can also http://chat.stackexchange.com/faq#mutehide specific users' posts; this might be a good short-term option for people who don't want to see Taisho.

Since Taisho is a subject where I don't have strong opinions, any action I took as a moderator would be taken after a round of discussion and input from the community. 


  
  What additional value would you add to the existing moderator team?
  


This is a bit tough to answer for someone like this:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/sxGiFl.gif

All I can bring to the team is passion for the site and a track record of working for its benefit, sometimes in helpful ways and sometimes in misguided ways. This is the only anime community that I've ever felt moved to participate in over many years of loving anime, and I want to see it become even more amazing.

What's you opinion on them as they might feel unconformable due to image bots.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnkitSharma For now I'd suggest the hide user feature. I get where they're coming from but from looking at past discussions on this issue, some people have pretty strong feelings about keeping Taisho as he is, so a decision to can him shouldn't be made lightly. It would be nice if we could hide Taisho by default and those who want him can turn him on, but I don't know if that's possible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your viewing circles is a great idea to wake up A&M, pity it had no support.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Neeshka It had some support, but not as much as I thought was needed to make it successful. Looking back, my expectations might have been unrealistic; when the election is over (whether or not I win), I plan to make some tweaks, seek some input from the crowd in Maid Cafe, and try again. I also plan to flesh out my Anime Fights idea and see how it goes over.

  Quite a lot of the activity on the site is concentrated around just
  a few shows: mainly Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and
  Death Note. While these are all fine shows, they hardly showcase the
  diversity of anime, and don't leave a lot for people who aren't fans
  of long-running action/adventure. What's your take on this
  situation? Is it fine as it is, or should the community strive for
  more diversity of topics—more shoujo, more older anime, more
  artsy/experimental material like Aku no Hana and Goodnight, Punpun?
  If you support more diversity, what steps would you take as a
  moderator to make it happen?
  


There is nothing we can do to prevent people from asking questions on Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and Death Note especially since they are famous world wide, compared to shows like Date a Live for example. However I believe that we do need diversity. If most questions are about those said anime/manga, then this site would become so homogenic, and it will be no longer fun and interesting.

We can't ask people outsite our community to give more diverse questions, so it falls on us to do so. Which means that we need to expose ourselves to various different anime/manga, that is read more manga, watch more anime, indulge ourselves in news regarding anime, manga, seiyuu, to make ourselves more knowledgeable. Anyone who get elected as the new moderator needs to promote such way of life by, for example, post random news about seiyuu or a quick summary on a manga or anime he/she found in the chat room to make people interested in it every now and then.


  
  Last year we asked the community about things they wanted to be
  clarified or fixed about our policies on Anime & Manga. This helped
  myself as the newly elected mod highlight some topics for review.
  One year on and a new meta post later, Is there any particular
  policy the site currently has that you feel needs to be changed, or
  reviewed?
  


No, currently none.


  
  Some Stack Exchange moderators are activists—they take a strong
  leading role in the community, bringing up issues, guiding
  discussions, suggesting policy, and creating initiatives. Others are
  more passive; they let other members of the community shape policy,
  enforce it less stringently, and wait in the wings for exceptional
  situations that require their unique abilities. The passive approach
  fits more with Stack Exchange's description of moderators as
  "glorified janitors" and "human exception handlers" as laid out in A
  Theory of Moderation and other posts. However, activist moderators
  can be good for a site; they can help unite and guide a user base,
  and can ensure that a valid concern brought up by a significant
  minority of the community gets a fair hearing and doesn't get
  automatically ignored in favor of the majority view. As a moderator,
  would you be more of an activist, or would you take a more passive
  approach? Why? How would you recognize a situation that would
  benefit more from the opposite approach, and how would you deal with
  it?
  


Mostly passive. Of course when there are valid concerns that needs to be addressed then the moderator should bring it up so that we can all decide what to do with it. Moderator can post their own opinion on the matter, but given their status, they should also make it clear that that is an opinion as a user and as a member of the community, not as a moderator.


  
  This year we have only had 7 Candidates nominated to join the mod
  team while last year there was 8 candidates. can you see any sort of
  barrier that would prevent other users from applying to become a
  part of the mod team in the next election? If so, in what way do you
  think we as a community can overcome this barrier? If not, what are
  your opinions as to why so few nominated to become a mod this time?
  


There is not much of a difference between 7 and 8 to make me think that only a few nominated themselves to be a mod. What is more interesting is that the last 3 candidates signed up on the last day and almost the same time. If there is any barrier at all to this election then it is because we have senshin nominating himself while at the same time only 1 will get selected as the new moderator. Currently senshin has the highest candidate score, even higher than the 3 moderators (Madara, Tomato, and Krazer). This might have prevented people from applying because either they feel they stand no chance against senshin or they feel, "why don't we just vote senshin since he clearly is the best candidate we have." I think Tomoe Mami nominating herself has something to do with why we have the additional 3 candidates singing up late. Indirectly she encouraged people to sign up since she clearly has the lowest candidate score.


  
  Last Year we had problems with Identification Requests with what
  should be done with them being asked of the candidates in last
  year's mod election. With the topic now dead, buried, covered in
  concrete and without a spoon to eat it's way out is there another
  outstanding [single] subject that you think the community needs to
  address? why does this subject need to be addressed?
  


Diversity issue. Lately we have too many Naruto, Bleach, One Piece questions, especially Naruto. There is nothing we can do to stop people, especially new users from asking questions about those anime, nor should we do anything to stop them since such action would be harmful to the site in that we are cutting ourselves from potential addition of regular users. Talking from personal experience, I get uncomfortable with this, I even ignored a question about Naruto that I should be able to answer out of being bored of answering Naruto related questions. I think something needs to be done to increase the diversity so that users, especially old users won't get bored of this site and making us potentially losing them. This can only be done if we are more familiar to various different anime/manga. Which is why I suggest in my answer for the 1st question that a short summary of a manga or anime be posted every now and then to make people interested and pick them up.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of
  valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of
  arguments/flags from comments?
  


I think such a thing is fine. But since we are not forum, then after 10 or so comments, we need to move it to the chat so that it won't get too long. Later on the conclusion gained from the chat can be posted as a comment or an edit to the answer. 


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod
  closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Be open with him, try to talk to him in the chat or post question in meta and explain why I think the question should not be closed. Being open is important here since we are communicating with text only and thus unless we write it there is no way other can know what we are thinking since we can't read their facial expression.


  
  We have a number of community events from annual events like
  Conspiracy Santa to one off events like EU A&M Meet up. Are there
  any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster
  community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase
  activity and participation on the site?
  


Conspiracy Santa happens on Northern Hemisphere Winter. We need event for the other seasons to increase our nakama-bond (community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation). Since we are Anime and Manga SE, we need activities that is related to those. Thus, my suggestion is...


Spring (Spring Gathering)


In spring people gather to enjoy the sakura (like what Toshinou Kyouko did with her friends in Yuru Yuri San Hai! Ep. 12). This event should be done on weekend to ensure participation. The gathering will be done on rabb.it and pretty much like Krazer has done (see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2666/anime-club-event-come-watch-anime-with-us-this-weekendthis post). Announcement should be made 7 days prior to remind everyone. Users are encouraged to suggest what to watch. I propose doing this yearly on the first Sunday of March. With fixed time and prior announcement it would be easier for people to allocate time to ensure they can join the event.


Summer (Summer Ghost Story)


What is commonly shown as an activity people in anime and manga do during summer is dating, losing virginity, change appearance, courage test and gathering around a candle and tells ghost stories. The first 3 won't help our community, the 4th is hard to do since we are all living in different parts of the planet. So I suggest the last, Ghost Story telling.

A question will be opened every year on August 1st UTC 0:0:0 and participants can post answer until August 14th GMT 23:59:59. Participants can post a ghost story as an answer. All users can give +1 on stories that they think is scary. Winner for the year is the one with the most vote. Since we now have badge for series (such as Naruto badge), maybe we should also give Summer-Kaidan-[INSERT YEAR HERE]-Champion badge to the winner as to encourage participation, especially since it is going to be a unique one-of-a-kind badge.


Fall/Autumn


Sorry, no idea how we can turn Sports and Culture festival into something that can be done regardless of time difference. Will post something later when I get some idea.

EDIT: Okay, I just remembered that other than the festival, they also have election where they choose the King and Queen of the school. So we will do our own election. Categories including Best Male Seiyuu, Best Female Seiyuu, Best Male Character, Best Female Character which will be separated into 4 different questions. Every user can only post 1 candidate for each category along with the reason why they think he/she deserves the title. The candidate must be featured in an anime/manga during the last year. So for the 2016 event, only characters/seiyuu featured from Fall 2015 to Summer 2016 is eligible. For example, for the Best Male Character 2016, Sakamoto is eligible, Kurosaki Ichigo is eligible (since the manga still runs during that time period), Katsuragi Keima is not since TWGOK anime and manga didn't run during the time period. If it is hard to keep track on which manga still run during the time period, which not, then we can keep it as anime only.


  
  What's your opinion on Taisho posting images in site's main
  chatroom? Taisho's image posting did got criticized in the past for
  being unnecessary or for not being safe for office. So what you
  think in favor or against it?
  


The main reason why Taisho was criticized was because the images posted was borderline hentai or too kinky. The images he posted now is a lot better. Taisho, I think is a good addition to our chat room that makes it unique, so we need to preserve the cat. As long as no NSFW pictures posted, it should be fine to keep him.

Of course since we are all living in different countries with different values, then the pictures needs to be regulated strictly, so an image of Kashiwazaki Sena with her cleavage showing is a no no even if she is fully clothed. In other words, the images posted should be neutral enough so that it is acceptable regardless of cultural and value difference. It also needs to be diverse enough. Even if the images is SFW, but if all it posted is pictures of loli or girls, then it is still no good. Adding anime scenery images would be a good addition, I think.


  
  What additional value would you add to the existing moderator team?
  


What we needed the most, and is the reason why we have this election in the first place, availability.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5#8: If community members start dating and losing their virginity with each other, that might actually help community relations ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5#9:  Anime images often move the goalposts with NSFW, especially depending on what environment you're looking at the images in, how old the character is perceived to be, and what it is they are or are not wearing.  For example, seinen (those of us older than 17) would *probably* be alright with a picture of Sena, especially considering that she can often appear like that in the anime and manga, but those younger users may *not* be comfortable with this.  Also, your boss wouldn't be comfortable with it anyway.  (cont'd in next comment)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont'd) If this is the case, how can we blanket say that Taisho needs to say and still display images?  If you were elected, how would you deal with the individual cases in which someone was offended by cleavage from a character who does this *normally* in their series?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That is why I said that the images posted by Taisho needs to be neutral, in that it should be acceptable universally. I also suggested that it to be more diverse, like by adding scenery images so that the post won't be all girls. It is not a matter of being a moderator or not. Users can add images to the list of images Taisho can post. We can only know that the image is not neutral enough after Taisho posted it. Sure we can know beforehand, but who would check the list beforehand? Thus we all need to have an agreement not to add non-neutral images to the list.

Again, there's nothing terribly surprising here, but someone might find this data interesting. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Home sites" of 2016 election votersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd like to ask how other small sites like ours compare with their own vs SO voter percentage, just out of curiosityb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also voted and my home site is movies.se, Is there some issue with this statsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnkitSharma Yes, there appears to be some kind of bug. The query I linked returns 28 rows, but when I remove the ORDER BY clause from the final SELECT, it returns 31 rows. One of the missing rows is a count of 1 for StackExchange.Movies, which I suppose is you. I do not know currently know why this is happening.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnkitSharma There was no bug; I'm just an idiot - I ran this query too soon after the election ended, meaning that some of the people who voted towards the end of the election (like you) earned their Constituent badges after the Sept 4 SEDE import. Another import happened an hour ago, which includes everybody who voted in the election, so the data I'm about to edit in should be correct for real.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase So, one of the issues with doing that is that we are forced to determine a user's home site based on their reputation _at the time the query is run_, rather than their reputation at the time they voted (because SEDE doesn't have a reputation history table, and re-computing reputation snapshots from votes and stuff takes long enough that SEDE will kill the query). This is why I ran the queries for us quite soon after the election ended. With that caveat in mind, I can run this for some other sites (not now but in the near future) and report my findings since you're interested.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok I understand these limitations and yes I'm still interested to learn about how many residents and non-residents vote on average and how we compare.


















Since May 2016, data about when Community bumps a question to the front page https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/260010/has been available in the Data Explorer. This gives us a way to automatically identify questions that get kicked to the front page frequently. Specifically, http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/539033/community-bumped-posts-in-need-of-attention?MinimumBumpCount=2this query captures a notion of questions that get bumped often. I feel these posts deserve our attention if for no other reason than that it gets boring seeing them on the front page every month. (For reference, https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/184511/here are the criteria for determining which posts get bumped. Since our site is small, and we have considerably fewer than 30 * 24 = 720 bumpable questions, every bumpable question gets bumped every month.)

Here are the posts from the query that have 5 recorded bumps (i.e. monthly since May):


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/31323/Song played at the end of episode 20 of Parasyte
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/31342/How do the visions happen when Itami hits his head on EP.1?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/29582/Who is Mir's Mind Guardian?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/9942/What does Headphone Actor represent or mean?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/3755/In the end of the last episode of RahXephon, does everyone retain their old memories?

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/5691/Ending of Bloody Monday season 3
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/6751/Why didn't Masashi Miyamoto take Taira's chip after cutting his fingers?


For each of these posts, we should consider the following approaches to get the post off the list of bumpable questions:


Is the question off-topic? If so, we should close it.
Is the question bad? If so, we should downvote it.
Are the existing answers to the question good? If so, we should upvote them. 
Are the existing answers to the question unsalvageably bad? If so, we should downvote them, and flag them as low-quality and/or vote to delete them.
Are the existing answers to the question acceptable, but not good? If so, we should write a better answer, or bounty the question to encourage somebody to write a better answer.


For example, on the Parasyte question (which is the only one of these that I know enough about), I investigated a little bit and found that the existing answer was correct - so I upvoted it. Now, this question won't get bumped anymore! 

I encourage you all to do the same.

Sometimes we miss them, sometimes they get edited in later. Here's a query to find all instances of the words mangafox, kissanime and mangareader:

You can edit the query to add more words contained in potentially illegal links.

I suggest the following:

When posting a Music Identification Request you should expect to see the series name indicated by the paired tag with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/musicmusic and/or in the question and a description of an identifiable scene that the music occurs. ie


  what is the music that plays in Sword Art Online when everyone is gathered in the town of beginning learning that Kayaba has prevented them for logging out


things which can also narrow the scene down are


an episode number
a timestamp
a link to a legal video source (some leeway given to youtube videos)


the first 2 points above can replace a scene description when used together. the last point should always come with a scene description even if the first 2 points are given because if the link dies the timestamp may become invalid, especially if the OP/ED/Transition Scenes/etc are removed (remember that OP and ED's combined are ~3 minutes).

If the request is vague...

request clarification and have the OP edit the question. if nothing happens (say within 24 hours but how long you wait is up to you) Vote to Close as Unclear.

maybe also leave a comment saying that the question can be re-opened if clarification is edited in, this will then put the closed question in the Review Que for reopen votes.

In essence from the description you should know or be able to believe that the described scene can be referenced with a timestamp if one isn't given. 

using the link in this question that would be closed as unclear as the scene is described to be "near the end of the episode" and at what time would one consider near the end?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think there always has to be a timestamp, no matter what source (legal tv episode, dvd or a pirate streaming site).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @Hakase. Really, I can't think of any reason that anybody should have difficulty including an episode number and timestamp (for precision) AND a description of the scene where the music plays (in case of time-shifting because of ads, sponsor messages, etc). Hakase - I notice you've been policing these questions fairly aggressively lately. Thanks for that; I'll try to keep on top of them too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin I've just been noticing them, that's all :p Besides it's basic search logic to look through soundtrack listings and anime lyrics sites. Maybe we should have a guide for music ID, just like for anime ID.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin one legitimate reason i can think of that an asker may not include a timestamp is if they saw it in a format they can't review such as on TV or in the Cinema.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X D'oh. I genuinely forgot that people watch TV! You're right, that's a legitimate reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase well there can be the situation where the asker posts a small segment or highlight of an episode, said video may only be a few minutes long and it's timestamp probably wont match to the full episode. though if the user does post a full episode then yeh maybe then we can expect a timestamp aswellb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, if it's a cut of only the relevant fragment, it's fine not to add a timestamp, but in a general case we're usually talking about a whole episode.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5youtube videos of minutely small segments of episodes can fall under [fair use.](https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/fair-use.html#yt-copyright-four-factors) - IANAL, but you don't see Hasbro suing people for posting those 3 second pony videos. For the music identification, probably only few seconds would suffice to point where it begins.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It'd be helpful if there was a button on the review queue that read something like "Extra detail needed", sometimes a question with merit needs touching up, but No Action Needed and VTC are quite opposite ends of the spectrum. I know there is the edit button, but a lot of the time the reviewer doesn't have the appropriate knowledge, perhaps a request edit button would be helpful. Not just for these music questions but in general.


















Sometimes people post "where do I read/watch X" and it isn't phrased as looking for legal shop or streaming site links, so it could have been intended as looking for illegal sites. We seem to have agreed on editing it to be explicitly about legal links only, and then accept that question. In cases where OP is clearly not asking for that, we close it with our custom illegal links reason.

But are we okay with converting possibly  bad questions into somewhat less bad ones like that? Do you think they become useful to anyone and worth keeping around? Especially when asking about rather popular or mainstream works.

Some sites have a rule against asking "shopping questions" like "where can I buy " because they're largely useless and it's too easy to find it yourself if you just google "X buy". Do you think we should keep all our questions like that?

Sometimes there are cases I can agree we should keep, like asking where to buy a rare or specific version of a product which was discontinued or isn't sold in OP's region/country. But even so, do you think we should keep searching for people where to buy discs, printed manga books, etc?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we think questions about where to read/watch (legal) anime or manga are acceptable?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we already agree to accept these questions http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/q/595/2869b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I personally do not like these questions at all. I think they are _bad_, because this site is strictly worse for these questions than Google (and maybe looking the thing up on ANN or similar) in almost all cases. However, I'm not sure that I have a principled argument for why these questions should be closed (aside from, as you mention, occasional cases that are actually interesting and difficult-to-Google questions, which should remain open).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I don't love those questions,  I will admit that when I google "where to read X manga?"  I generally get a list of sites that are questionably legal at best.  You do know the answer and often I don't.


















I think questions about "where do I read/watch X" are not acceptable in more than 99% of the cases (that's probably worse than identification requests, and we got rid of that one), because think about it, how many of them aren't asking for illegal or copyrighted materials AND which you won't find on a legal distributor/broadcaster/official site? We already have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/923/8486this, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/8671/8486this and https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/9492/8486this, enough info to answer almost everyone's calls, provided your region is not blocked from viewing the contents.

You could potentially ask this question for every tag there is/ever will be and in most cases they wouldn't be of interest to more than a few people. Heck, these kinds of questions don't even enrich our understanding of a series or anime/manga in general. They aren't even fun. Do you believe they have a place here?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's what I'm thinking. We should probably figure out  the clear rules for when we do keep them in that 1% of cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase I would say the 1% of cases are things like http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/23032/7579 where the show is old, hard to find, or has a weird release history. Or questions like e.g. "Where can I see the Streamline dub of _Akira_?" I think we should accept. Otherwise, no bueno. Anyone who knows how to use Google can find where to get a giant popular series like Hunter x Hunter, legally or otherwise.


















I have to state that from an ethics perspective giving recommendations where someone can go to possibly commit piracy is not on the right side of things.  There are places where you can pay memberships to have access to manga/anime online, but there is no way of telling if these sites are actually legitimate.  Crunchyroll has paid licenses with companies in east asia, as well as Funimation, but the majority of other manga sites are hard to get information on.

I always stick to recommending online stores that carry manga, that way I can make a real recommendation, and support an industry that frankly is still niche and needs the support.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From an ethics perspective it's unethical to go to a site which specializes on answering questions about anime/manga plot and ask where to buy discs, watch streams or manga books. It's okay to ask in chat, but on the main site, I don't think it's all that reasonable. Not trying to shut you up, but you raised a point based on ethics, and I don't think that's a way to go about this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 You do raise a good point though.  With the name being just Anime and Manga, how is one to know that the site is mainly about plot? it's also unethical to ask questions here that could easily be answered with a simple google search....why make people do the work when a search engine can.   Now, I do hope no one asks me to explain the plot of  Odin:  Photon Space Sailer Starlight *shudder*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We already don't permit answers that suggest using unlicensed sites, so that's less of an issue here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good to know that there's one rule I won't be accidentally violating *there's always at least one.*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`how is one to know that the site is mainly about plot?` − from the [Tour page](http://anime.stackexchange.com/tour) and [Help Center's "What questions are on topic?"](http://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) which are visible enough for a new user to find and read.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most people tend to ignore tour pages and similar threads, simply due to the concept of "my question is important to me, so I will ask it."    If a rule were to be put in place against these questions, it needs to be concise, short, to the point.  as Gao states "these kinds of questions don't even enrich our understanding of a series or anime/manga in general"  Have the reason for not allowing be just that:  Does not enrich community understanding of a series or Anime.Manga in general.  Won't stop the questions from being asked, but will have a simple way to explain why a question was deleted.


















All of these questioned should be marked as a duplicate of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/922/how-can-i-tell-if-a-site-is-legal/923#923this question.  Ideally the title of that questions should be where can I watch shows online legally.  Alternatively, we can have a respectable user post a question and answer at the same time which points the user to "Can I Stream It" and the previously mentioned question.

These questions are only specific questions of that existing one.  Just closing the question without providing any support will push away potential new users.  Marking as a duplicate will push away a few who think this site is for conversations but still pretty much gives them the help they came here for.

My only issue is I don't know where such policies are listed.

when i tried to create https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/occultic-nineoccultic-nine to match with other tages like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/steins-gatesteins-gate, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chaos-headchaos-head and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/robotics-notesrobotics-notes which used the same naming structure as the others (Occultic;Nine, Steins;Gate, Chaos;Head, Robotics;Notes) i got this

(He didn't make it a synonym, though. There's no point in having tags that differ only by hyphens be made synonyms of one another, since the tag autocompleter will find the tag either way.)

In https://anime.stackexchange.com/revisions/37137/2revision 2 of the same question, Arcane created the tag [occulticnine]. The OP then changed it back to [retag], which is why no questions with [occulticnine] showed up in search for you. The zero-use-tag-deleter will get rid of [occulticnine] when it runs in a few hours, but for now [occulticnine] still lives.

Apparently we still rank pretty high on "identify anime" search engine query, and it's supposedly because we still have around 400 of them, which makes them the 3rd most popular tag, and that means it is displayed on our front page for every non-logged in visitor. And the StackExchange authorities https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3945/191already told us they can't hide specific tags from the front page. Also I don't think that's how search engine ranking works anyhow coz there would still be a huge number of questions left with the tag to get us a high position in search results for anime identification. So we still get some ID requests which get closed and deleted pretty often.

It's been almost 6 months since we banned the ID requests. Have they had enough visibility by now? Should we dispose of them for good in hopes of lowering our search ranking for identification?

(note that there's no guarantee it will actually work as well as intended or at all)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we delete the remaining ID questions to possibly reduce the number of still incoming ID posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FYI, the feature-request is currently on the roadmap. It is, however, pretty low-priority, so it might take a while to get it implemented. Does not invalidate the rest of the discussion, but thought you should know anyway.


















When browsing the site before ID questions were outlawed, the questions were full of them and you sometimes had to go back a few pages of active questions to glance at one day’s worth.

Now, with ID questions not allowed the overall question volume is rather low. I have a few ignored tags which means I don’t take much more than five or ten minutes to check a day’s worth of anime.

It is possible that most of those ID questions use a tag that I ignore, I don’t know. But my perception tells me that we basically did away with them consequently. The remaining that still make their way through are quickly nuked dealt with with downvotes, flags and close votes. If they are not manually deleted, Roomba deletes them automatically after seven days. (I have no way to check the method of deletion.)

Having the tag standing there is, well, unfortunate. The best solution is to get more questions that use other tags so that it will no longer be among the top five.

I don’t think that there is any action that must be taken.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's no way we're getting up to 400 questions on any single tag to make the id tag go away from that page, let alone 7 times that much. The next most used tag has only 263 questions.

I suggested https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/32925this edit and it was rejected/edited, with the following message attached:


  This edit did not correct critical issues with the post - view the revision history to see what should have been changed.


Naturally, I looked at the revision history to see what I'd missed. Surprisingly, almost no real content had been changed from my edit. The two biggest changes I saw were changing "deserts" to "desserts" and adding a period after one of the instances of "Dr," which, I acknowledge, I missed. 

However, since literally every other change I proposed was left alone (aside from choosing to use "will" instead of "would," which does absolutely nothing to change the meaning of the post and works just fine either way), I don't see why this was rejected and edited, rather than simply improved. I was under the impression that Rejection + Editing was due to the edit being inherently bad, while acknowledging that edits to the original posts were necessary. Was my proposed edit really that bad?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How did this edit not address the "critical" issues of the post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most likely by mistake. Have you seen the editing interface?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase, yes, I review posts on Arqade daily. Even if you click Reject and Edit by mistake, you can cancel. Similarly, Rejecting a post requires you to select a reason. I also am pretty sure the order of buttons is `Accept`, `Improve`, `Reject`, *then* `Reject and Edit`, but I may be mistaken...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I rejected it because I didn't understand why you removed the link.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ShayminGratitude It wasn't attached to anything and there was no way to access it. I didn't see a purpose in it being there...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ShayminGratitude In fact, the link is still inaccessible even with your edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, I'd say I made a mistake then. When I read your edit comment, I thought you meant that the video link was dead, which wasn't the case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There was a major problem in there, being that you left the [2] reference in there and didn't change it to [1]. Obviously, that would have been an approve and edit though, not a reject and edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ShayminGratitude then that was my bad. I was about to click submit edit with the link still included but removed it at the last second. Forgot to alter the numbers afterwards. I'll be more explanatory in my edit comments going forward to avoid this, though.


















The reviewer was probably thinking along the lines of the removal of the link being in conflict with the author's intent. Given the age of the post, it is unlikely the original poster was going to go back and edit that link back in.  Thus, it seems the reviewer made a mistake. Clearly the reviewer should have reviewed the edit more carefully.

Just a quick observation:  If the official policy is that ID reqs are banned, wouldn't leaving current ones in place possibly send a mixed message?  

Clearing out what is banned should be even across all banned questions.  Are questions that are banned for other reasons left in place?  

The way I see it, if new users do not see a bunch of ID requests, even with closed tags, on the front page, they may possibly slow down and eventually stop posting new ones.

A quality answer to a banned question, while a quality answer, is still to a banned question.  I see it as a having your cake and eating it too situation.  Keep the questions with quality answers, and you may be leaving the door open for new ID requests, as people will get the sense that the ban is not an "every ID request" thing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is fairly common practice on other Stack Exchange sites to keep around old questions that are no longer deemed on-topic, if they were considered good at the time. This is what the historical lock feature is for, and all existing [identification-request] questions are historical-locked. (Not saying that _we_ should necessarily follow precedent, but the precedent does exist.) Note also: users will never see [identification-request] questions on the front page because historical-locked questions cannot be bumped.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, yes true. At around 1am, i think part of my brain was asleep.  Anyway, how about reclassifying the ID requests that were considered good, say, have a page with those answers on them, so the actual ID requests are not searchable?  Again, likely not a good option, just tossing out an idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As senshin said, new user’s won’t see any *questions* with this tag on the front page unless they explicitly *open* the tag. (Reposting that part of the comment to give it more visibility. The remainder of senshin’s comment is also valuable, though!)


















Assuming our https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/286105/do-not-show-blacklisted-tags-under-explore-our-questions-for-non-logged-in-usefeature request is not done, I can see 4 ways to proceed with this. All but one would need to be done by moderators, because ordinary users can't do anything apart from favorite/unfavorite/share to historically locked questions (not even flags).


Status Quo. Do nothing and leave https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request on the main page. It will eventually disappear, but this may take many years. It's questionable how big of a problem the presence of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request really is. We are not getting that many new ID questions, and the ones that do get asked are shut down quickly. No one even noticed this issue for months. So perhaps no action is really required. However the status quo is admittedly annoying even if mostly harmless.
Delete all existing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions. I'm not a fan of this because the remaining ones are generally agreed to be fairly high quality, and historical locks were done for a reason. Removing those questions entirely for 99% of visitors isn't a good idea in my opinion. They are high-quality content, even if it's a type of content that we've decided not to continue going forward. This is exactly the situation where we should be preserving the questions with historical locks. In addition, it would require moderators to manually delete almost 400 posts, which is a lot of work. Probably someone at the CM or dev level can do it automatically, but I don't think an ordinary mod can.
Merge the remaining https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions into a different tag. The only one which could plausibly be used here without causing major harm is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag. I don't like the idea of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag being a big tag on the site, even if the questions are all historically locked. It would solve this issue of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request being one of the top tags, but https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag being one of the top tags is not great either. That said, this is also fairly easy for a moderator to do; it would only take a handful of clicks total.
Retag the remaining https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request questions individually to have the identified work's tag. The remaining questions are all solved, so there's nothing stopping us from switching the tag to the identified work apart from old policies that made sense when we were taking ID requests but are irrelevant now. Moderators can retag the questions without unlocking them first. Hence this is not a lot more work per question than just deleting them. Probably a handful of the questions will not be able to be retagged easily, but enough should be doable that we'd get https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request off the front page. This has the undesired effect that all of these questions will be bumped to the front page again, but if the retagging is done slowly enough that is not a huge problem. It also will add a lot of small tags (which is probably a good thing) but populate them with now-offtopic questions that aren't very interesting to anyone who cares about the tag (a slightly negative but mostly inconsequential thing).


All of these except #1 need to be done by mods, and #2 and #4 require a significant amount of effort from the mods over questions that we mostly just want to ignore. My personal preference would be a combination of #3 and #4, to first merge all remaining ID requests into https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag, and then individually tag them as the solved series as time and front page space permits. 

However because of the amount of work this would require from the moderators, if they don't have the time and energy to do this, I'd rather leave the decision up to them. They're the ones who will potentially have to spend a few hours to do this depending on what is chosen, and ultimately I don't think this is a big enough problem that we should force any particular solution on them. I'd be willing to do it myself over the course of a couple weeks, but I'm certain there is no way for an ordinary user can edit a historically locked question (that's kind of the point) so this is moot.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Something tells me that simply editing the tags to not say "identification" would not make google drop our ranking much or at all, because the text of the questions would remain along the lines of "what is this anime" which is most relevant when searching for anime identification sites. I also feel a little bad every time I type "identification" here which presumably increases our search ranking even more :sb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think this is a big deal. Google's algorithms are based on the amount posts are linked to (especially external links, which are rare for ID questions) and the proximity of keywords to the top of the page. The biggest thing is removing [identification-request] from the main page. If the questions are several clicks away and hard to find, Google will also rate that low. Similarly meta gets very little weight...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...In addition, I have not seen a large number of incoming attempted traditional identification questions, and the number will continue to drop with time as new posts of that type cease to appear (newer content is ranked higher typically). So all-in-all I think this is a non-issue from an SEO perspective, apart from possibly [identification-request] from the main page which may have a small effect.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like #4 - putting these locked questions to good use by using them as anchors for new series tags sounds like about the best possible thing we could do here. I, for one, would be willing to spend the time doing the retagging needed to implement #4.

  This is a comment that i wrote about one moth ago i cant find the link but you can find some good answers in the link that i gave you


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/36456/how-does-a-mangaka-get-paid/37230#comment50234_37090Oct 29 at 20:42 (note that they posted this ~12 minutes after posting a link to a page with near identical content)


  Actually its a copy paste from my own comment should i still put the name?


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/36456/how-does-a-mangaka-get-paid/37230#comment50249_37090Oct 30 at 6:17

from my perspective even if the David Sodeyama above isn't the David Sodeyama who made the post Golden Time's answer is a poor copy and paste (as it didn't even preserve the link where it says "According to this article" so there is no articular to speak of) and they are "taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own."

So my question is what should be done with this answer?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should be done about an answer that is plagiarizing another's post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think one way to confirm the user here is the user there is if the user there edits their post saying he's the user here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can't just stop or control plagiarism in cyber world. It's too difficult. Why not we just edit the answer/post and put some credit to the owner? Flag or report it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While we can't stop plagiarism for happening, it's irresponsible to allow blatant acts such as this one go by without scrutiny. Straight copy and paste jobs for answers will not be tolerated. Passing off a copied answer from someone is your own is an even worse offense. The user, being unregistered, was given is warning about this behavior in the comments. If the user tries to pull the same shit again, his account will be subject to deletion. While we definitely don't want copypasta answers, we also want to discourage straight quotes of other answer, even with a link back.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We'd like to encourage users so summarize the key points of passages they quote instead of copying and quoting the entire passage. However people are lazy. If you see and answer that's looks like they just dropped block quote and a link to the source, please try to encourage the answer to summarize the key points of the quote. At little effort can go a long way in making a better answer.


















Plagiarizing entire passage of text without proper attribution is completely irresponsible and unacceptable. The least you can do is provide a link to the original. 

The first offenses of blatant plagiarism without attribution will merit a warning and deletion of the answer. Subsequent offenses, depending on the frequency and severity may result in possible suspension of the offending account, on top of deletion of the answer. For unregistered users, simple deletion of the answer is enough.

With that being said, even if the original writer, David Sodeyama, is in the right. Soliciting votes and views on another Q&A site within an answer is discouraged. These answers should be deleted, because they are not answers. We are us and they are they, it's fine to cite a passage from their answer on another site, provided you properly attribute it. But don't go about asking users to go to another site, register, and vote on your answer.

In this case it should be noted that Quora's https://www.quora.com/How-can-material-on-Quora-be-reused-elsewhere-What-are-the-licensing-terms-What-about-in-the-case-where-a-user-has-selected-the-not-for-reproduction-optionterms of use allow for reproduction on external sites, unless the material is explicitly designated "https://www.quora.com/How-does-Quora-intend-to-make-the-not-for-reproduction-feature-enforceablenot for reproduction"

Per Quora's Terms of Use, the author's expressed permission is not required in this case, but proper attribution is required.

All in all, it's been made clear that the user in question did not personally write the answer. It should be noted that subsequent plagiarism attempts in the future by this (currently unregistered) user will result in the destruction of his user account, without any further warnings.

so looking at the suggested edit review i came across https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/33064this one. the question is an id request and in this case the OP made the question while unregistered and then created a new account when they went to edit.

now because we don't accept id request aside from a limited sub selection (the anime series must be known) the edit is kinda pointless since in the end the question will be closed and deleted.

from my understanding edits are supposed to improve content but since id requests are for the most part un-salvageable should we accept suggested edits to un-salvageable questions?

NOTE: the linked edit was approved while i was making this but the question still applies
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should edits to un-salvageable off-topic questions be accepted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Will the edit prevent the closure? No? No improvement whatsoever


















In case of ID requests, I don't think it really matters either way. Just don't forget to cast your close and delete votes, because that's what's important.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Concur. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter what you do with suggested edits on questions that are on their way to closure/deletion.


















I've seen a few questions so far that are very probably off topic (at least in wording and maybe even in what the OP wants to know). 

An example here is: https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/37330/"How much do VNs cost in production and how much profit do they give" (as that is way too general for someone to be able to answer I take it that this formulation in the least is unanswerable. And I THINK also the question itself as long as profit is asked for (not for a specific VN but generally) is also off topic / unanswerable.

Now my own question is: What is the correct way to handle such a question when you stumble upon it? Just point out to the OP that his question can't be answered / is probably off topic (with a possible minus vote).

Or should you also point him/her into the direction of specific forums (not via links, but via search words for google) where he/she could get an answer from? (all in comments not answers naturally).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to handle questions that are very probable off topic / unanswerable?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question you cite is certainly _difficult_ to answer, but I do not see why we should consider a question to be off-topic for this reason alone. It _might_ be "too broad", but it is conceivable that an informed person could provide a useful statistical answer along the lines of "n% of visual novels turn a profit according to report X; industry source Y claims that a visual novel requires k hours of development per hour of play time".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm thinking that currently it is too broad (as the costs itself depend on the artist in question and thus vary greatly even so much that not a real default price can be said there :/ ). The off topic like mentioned I'm not sure about if it is or not (that is why I said "probable/probably") as the profit is based on the costs, the marketing, ... and thus can also only be said for specific cases and not on a general base. As I'm not sure there if it is off topic or notI abstained from trying to answer (I have some experience when it comes to the cost). Thus my question about how to handle it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel that such questions when obvious individual answers are too varied, it might be possible to give an answer which is more aggregated, ie per studio, or industry-wide average. To generalise difficulty into unanswerable might be a stretch.


















I've just had a confusing few moments in the review view where the "allowing" buttons read Edit and Reopen and Reopen. The confusion came from seeing the edit difference below and thinking that this is a valid edit and it should be edited like that and reopened. But just the "Reopen" button suggested to me that I would not be agreeing with the edit below.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/AaaDl.png

Perhaps the button text could be less ambiguous?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Confusing text on review buttonsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be clear, "Reopen" means "the post is good enough to be reopened; it should be reopened as-is". "Edit and Reopen" means "I can edit the post to make it good enough to be reopened; it should be reopened once I edit it".


















It may have been on the minds of some users how inconsistent we are with spoilers on the site compared to our other fellow Stack Exchange site.

While not a pressing matter, it is a bit of a problem that merits resolution, to me at least.

On that topic I'd like to propose the following guidelines for spoilers:

I have four (4) categories in mind for spoilers:


New. This includes very recent spoilers for any story/character content from/about something anime/manga/novel/game within the last ninety (90) days (about one cour) of it's premiere 
Aged. Same as the above, but for content between ninety (90) days old and one (1) year old (about four cours)
Old. Same as the above, but for content between one (1) year and four (4) years old (one Olympiad, about sixteen cours)
Ancient. The same as above, but for content that is more than four (4) years old


Expected guidelines to follow for the above categories for the site:


Spoilers for "New" content 


Is mandatory 
The title of the question must not have any spoilers, nor should it imply any kind of spoilers
The body must use the spoiler markdown for the spoiler content
This gives users who prefer to watch a typical anime series at the end of it's cour some leeway as to not get immediately spoiled once some revelation is revealed
Writing only "spoiler" in the question title and/or body is not acceptable at all

Spoilers for "Aged" content 


The title may hint at a spoiler (including meta-spoilers) in the title but must not reveal anything significant
E.g., What happened to X character in Episode Y? Why did Q character do what he did in Chapter Z. Why does V series have Tragedy genre attached
The body must use the spoiler markdown for the spoiler content
The typical anime season lasts, 1 cour but there are occasionally those that last 2 cours. This gives users some leeway in case they like to watch a series after it's finished or prefer to follow the dubbed version (Fact: There are good dubs out there)

Spoilers for "Old" content


Spoilers in the title are left up to the discretion of the OP 
The use of spoiler markdown is optional in the body, but the user of the spoiler markdown is encouraged for significant spoilers
After a years has passed for a series, chances are that any spoilers for a series in question have already propagated throughout the internet. By then most people will have at least an inkling about spoilers in a particular series, thanks to the internet, social media, and memes

Spoilers for "Ancient" content


Spoilers in the title is acceptable and expected
Spoilers in the body without spoiler markdown is acceptable as well
Typically few anime are memorable enough to persist in memory more than 4 years in the minds of audiences, when they are, they usually are the ones most talked about 
If you haven't had time to watch the series within 4 years of it's premiere, chances are that you weren't interested in the series enough to begin with and wouldn't mind being spoiled



Expected guidelines to follow for the above categories for the chat:


Spoilers in the main chatroom are expected
A courtesy to other users, please consider using this hacky, cumbersome link spoiler markdown: [spoilers](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/# "Snape kills Dumbledore")
It should look something like this: //#FSN spoilers 


Hover over see the spoiler
There should be some url, /# at minimum, and then the spoiler text in quotes
No one is expected to know how to use this hacky method, the inefficient method is there if any one wants to use it. Implementation of https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/140965/why-doesnt-chat-allow-spoilersspoilers in chat was never intended to be supported anyway. 



How to enforce these guidelines:


Please edit and remind users that do not follow the above guidelines, if you have the privilege to do so, otherwise flag it


Link new/uninformed users to the meta explaining our spoiler policy
Users should be given three (3) chances to try to comply with these guidelines
Repeated disregard after that may warrant suspension 



Spoilers are inevitable, but this proposal intend to provide some consistency and courtesy to users who are sensitive about spoilers. 

What do you think? Do you like it? Hate it? Think it's a waste of time? Want to comment on how my lazy, unproofed writing and grammar sucks? Good or bad, your feedback is welcome.

Most question titles I can think of (that seem well-written, and that are somewhat related to important plot-points) seem to _at best_ fit into the criteria you've specified for "aged" series, if I'm trying to avoid spoilers.


















While we don't get many of them we do have a couple of popular questions and tags where there is a bit of overlap between the game continuity and related anime and manga spin-offs.

One popular and notable one in particular is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemonpokemon. 

While they have commonalities, each series has it's distinct type of distinction, such as it's story and worldbuilding. In my opinion, these the game continuity should be seperate from the anime and manga continuities. This can alleviate some of the ambiguity on questions that ask about the worlds specific questions. 

In that regard, I would like to propose changing the current https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemonpokemon tag into a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-seriespokemon-series franchise tag, have the game related questions tagged as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-gamepokemon-game, the anime with as their respective series name: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-animepokemon-anime, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-generationspokemon-generations, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-originspokemon-origins, etc. The same with the manga: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-adventurespokemon-adventures, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-electric-boogaloopokemon-electric-boogaloo, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pokemon-reburstpokemon-reburst, etc.

Series like the Tales series could have similar treatment, such as a general franchise tag for https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tales-seriestales-series, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tales-zestiria-gametales-zestiria-game, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tales-zestiria-xtales-zestiria-x, etc. 

These tags will be added on an as needed basis. While it does cause a bit of fragmentation, bu we can start applying the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3907/63prefix schema idea suggested by senshin to keeping things consistent, while maintaining distiction between anime/manga and games.

For popular franchises, we should look at updating and maintaining the franchise tag's tag wikis to include the all the currently series tags within the franchise for better recordkeeping.

What does the community think about such a change?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Scope discussion: Splitting anime-style game questions from anime/mangab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the major problem with this is that the most frequently used tags show up highest when question askers search for the tag and as a result mistagging may happen.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Will this open for other media types like pokemon-manga and pokemon-anime pokemon-go etc?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pokemon Go should be off-topic. There are multiple pokemon manga, while only one Pokemon anime. All other anime are short ovas, specials of said anime,  or seoerate shorts. The manga has at least 4 seperate and distinct spin-offs. Anything that fits under a [tag:pokemon-manga] general tag should also fit under a tag:pokemon-series] tag. So a general tag for pikemon manga seems unfeasible to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pokemon go does not have a history. We only address questions about history, plot and the underlying fictional universe therein. so GO is offtopic. @ToshinouKyouko


















I guess someone fixed this - JNat marked https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/286105/the post on Meta.SE as [status-completed], and indeed, [identification-request] is no longer listed as one of the tags on the front page for non-logged-in users.

Though I appreciate the initiative being drafted here, I'd like to point out https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/262/49what's been said before:


  Spoiler markup - which hides information - is by-design a reader-hostile feature! It should be used sparingly, and avoided whenever possible. 
  
  The last thing you want to do is encourage new users to start spoiler-marking every last detail of their posts on the off-chance that someone doesn't know them yet. This is supposed to be a community of experts and those seeking expert knowledge - don't http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamp_under_a_bushelhide your light under a bushel. 

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with this answer. As Madara mentioned on in another answer, different sites have different uses for the same features. We don't use ruby text as JLU would. We don't have videos anable because few of our answer are media heavy enough to warrant it. The anime and manga fandom community is somewhat sensitive to the subject of spoilers, as it may ruin their experience. The meta is intended to establish a baseline of etiquette that we can refer users to asking about spoilers. If we don't properly educate users of our features and etiquette, abundant spoilers in the tile can ruin things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a given that bit of common sense needs to applied in order to balance user experience in regards to spoiler. However it's worth noting that most of our user base falls under the 18 and under category compared to most other recreational sites. With that come a bit of immaturity and sometimes a lack of common sense. The proposal attempts to create a more spoiler neutral atmosphere by only restricting newer spoilers while allowing flexibility based on user discretion for older content. Some users like spoilers, but others don't. We can't keep everyone happy so we need to make a compromise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's all cool, and, as I said, **I appreciate the initiative being drafted here**. Just reiterating that hiding valuable content is no good for anyone, since no one will be able to find it then. Having a generic title ("what really happened to this character?") and >=75% of the body of the question hidden in spoilers means the question won't be easily found. And while that might mean that our regular users will still benefit from it, we're also losing out on drawing in new users and helping a larger audience that might reach us from search engines. **Just watch out for that**, is my point :)


















Several of the traffic sources have an identical number of page referrals. I think that this is way too lucky a coincidence since 6 sites have 258, 2 have 516, 3 have 773. What is going on here? 

From our https://anime.stackexchange.com/site-analytics/traffic-sourcesSite Analytics:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/bS3f2.png

It seems likely that the results are rounded to the nearest multiple of x for x slightly less than 258, or are sampled in such a way that only such multiples are possible. The number 258 is probably of no real significance, and if you come back later would probably change.


















Lately I have seen this question pop-up in the close-vote queue several times. 
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/37639/what-is-the-power-order-of-the-straw-hatsWhat is the power order of the Straw Hats?

As people might already have noticed from the comments, I don't think it should be closed. As there are plenty of in-universe sources available and even author statements to answer the question with, without to much of an opinion bias. 

However, quite some people do think it should be closed as being too opinion based.

Hence the meta post to determine it once and for all. 

Would a answer to this question be to biased by personal opinion, even with in-universe solutions available and be closed for it? Or does the availability of the in-universe solutions, even though as they might incur a slight personally bias be enough to consider it not opinion based and stay open as it currently is?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should this question be left open? Or is it opinion based?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm still puttering along through the early chapters of the Water Seven arc, so I'm not exactly a One Piece expert, but my gut tells me that someone with wide and deep knowledge of the series can in fact answer this question with facts. However, my gut also tells me that it's going to attract lots of awful answers with no facts at all, and the three answers so far are terrible, so I've protected the question while its fate is decided.


















Just my opinion. I've followed One Piece over a long time (~10 years) and it was one of the first Anime I picked up. 

I voted to close this question because it was too broad. I'll post my inital comment and then some alternative questions that I feel can be answered much better. This was my comment.


  The question is answerable but not of great quality because the answer will ALWAYS be primarily opinion based even if it tries to use canonical measurements. Luffy a 100M bounty defeats someone which the author states is worth 500m. Sogeking has less bounty than Franky but God Ussop has twice as much? There are simply too many variables to sort out a completely Non-opinion based list of power. Compare it to the strength order of Avengers or Justice League if you will. Drawing on the parallels, Who is stronger Cap or Iron Man? Martian Manhunter or Superman? and so on...


This covers the gist of my problems.

Since there is no absolute power rating like in DBZ. Someone dropped in Dourikis and Bounties, which are very flawed. 

Other than Fukurou we do not know anyone who can measure Douriki and absolute value is known ONLY for the CP9, thus making it unsuitable for anyone else. If the strength order of CP9, we have a question we can answer with the help of Douriki system!

Bounty is known to be flawed within the OP world itself. Robin had a bounty higher then Sanji, Chopper has the lowest Bounty in the crew, Ussop's recent bounty is higher then all the others except Luffy and Zoro. If the power is equivalent to bounty then this question can be answered by a simple Wikia link.

One Piece is meant to show that people are different, unique and can be weak and strong at the same time. Luffy was stronger then Enel just because of their DFs. Ussop is the only one that could beat Sugar, who could probably take every other "strong" Straw Hat. Oda regularly puts out statements about different attributes of Straw Hats. So I think questions like "What is the order of intelligence/Raw strength/Skill with Haki for straw hats?" can be answered better but would still draw opionated answer to some extent.

Another thing that comes from this is some people are right for the fight. How prepared are you for a fight, have you fought before, are you at a advantage/disadvantage due to your fighting style etc. pull a LOT of variables to consider to bring which can't all be resolved. The power of straw hats varies depending on who they are fighting and what they are fighting for (This has actually been said by Nami in the anime IIRC the Water 7 saga).

Thus according to me there are no in-universe solutions available that can answer this question completely.

I'll like to try another analogy here (Super Heroes may not have been that relatable). Which are Ash's strongest 6 pokemon? Or even which are the strongest Legendaries? Even with BSTs we all understand that one pokemon can be strong against something and weak against something else... So We can group them by BSTs but can't absolutely define a list for them.

It is true that there is no canonical way to order the characters by power, but to me that seems like an answer to the question, not a reason to close it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I have been planning to build an answer ranking the straw hats on different criteria as I mention in this question, but haven't had the time to spare on it! I have the coming week off so maybe I'll post it.


















Anime has a lot of different meanings, that's why I'm asking. A few meanings I've come across through many years.


Animation produced in Japan (many of the currently series known as "anime" are actually produced in Japan but animated in Korea)
Animation written, animated and produced in Japan
Animation animated in Japan but produced and written anywhere (ie: United States)
An art style which can be animated and written anywhere but with specific characteristics and a style originated in Japan which makes it look "anime"
Simply animation made anywhere (the original meaning of the word)


so this is why I'm asking, can fan made animations based in series currently known as "anime" be discussed in this community? There is a very interesting one going on right now
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can fan made anime based animations be asked in this community?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm pretty neutral opinion-wise on this but I'm just stopping by to say that this isn't a forum.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you might need to provide examples as i doubt and anything "fan made" is going to follow any established canon and acknowledged by the creators. *Magical Girl Noir Quest* if big fan made story but set totally outside the Madoka Universe in which Homura's terminated hundreds of timelines. the only example of a fan made work which may have been acknowledged by the creators is the Nanoha Fanfiction *The Legend of the Sword of the Day and the Sword of the Night* which was fan translated on nanofate.us before the author asked it to be taken down because it got published officallyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5sure fan made works arent going to be canon. As for acknowledged by the creators, not in the strict sense, but it's a known fact that many popular fan made creations end influencing the original canon story, though hardly ever officialy recognized (since it could be considered plagiarism)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and also many times people behind fan made works are incorporated in the official anime staff laterb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5btw, crossovers can be official but they can't be canon either (since they would contradict all the universe's timelines) but I assume they are allowed to be asked here (such as Luffy, Goku and Toriko crossover)


















Take a moment and get to know the site better by reading https://anime.stackexchange.com/tourour tour page. 

When you do, you'll see that:


  Anime and Manga is a question and answer site for enthusiastic anime and manga fans.


If you read futher you will note that only point where there is a mention of forum is:


  This site is all about getting answers. It's not a discussion forum. There's no chit-chat.


On the topic of fan-made works, see our https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/267/should-questions-about-doujinshi-be-allowedpolicy on doujinshi. Also see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/354/63the criteria for asking such questions.

This is my first post here on meta so please bare with me if it is off-topic. What is the purpose of and origin of hats? 

I just noticed these in the top menu bar when I logged in today on all the Stackexchange sites that I use. 

What do they do? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the origin of hats?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They do nothing besides comic relieve [See this blog post for the 'purpose'](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/12/Its-Hat-Season-Announcing-Winter-Bash-2016/?cb=1). wouldn't be able to tell you it's origins though :)


















Hats are the feature of an anual event called http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/12/Its-Hat-Season-Announcing-Winter-Bash-2016/?cb=1Winterbash. It’s just a fun thing serving no purpose except for comic relief and igniting competitiveness in those who care at the end of the year.

You get hats for doing certain things. Some hats are https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/288272public and known while others are https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/288284secret (spoiler alert). Some users enjoy guessing or confirming the conditions that win you secret hats.

This year, there is also a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDi_nj1-G6UYoutube video that explains where the idea of hats came from: they were an in-company joke that employees got to put on for performing certain stuff (the sales team for great deals, the dev team to get rid of old cables for something, etc.).

All hats will disappear again in early January and before a new Winterbash season starts next year the http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com/Winterbash 2016 page will be removed and no further record of past hats will exist.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, so the hats are edible and will spoil if not eaten. 


















I believe the tag for the series Poco's Udon World is misspelled.  It spells the character's name as "Poko" [pokos-udon-world].  The tag is currently associated with two questions, and there is no tag using the "poco" spelling.

I could find no English sources which use the "k" instead of "c".  The following sources use "c", which I feel makes it definitive.


Crunchyroll, as seen in this cover art:


https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvUd5.jpg


the English subtitles within the episodes themselves use "Poco" (time mark 13:34 of http://www.crunchyroll.com/pocos-udon-world/episode-2-kotoden-722097episode 2)


https://i.stack.imgur.com/IvleI.jpg


its English https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poco's_Udon_WorldWikipedia article uses Poco
its https://myanimelist.net/anime/32673/Udon_no_Kuni_no_Kiniro_KemariMy Anime List page uses Poco (as well as alternative titles without "Poco", Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari and the original うどんの国の金色毛鞠 )


I'm guessing I over-researched this.  Both existing questions are short and were posted by @Mindwin . They internally use the "Poko" spelling. This was unfortunate because previously I had hunted for questions about this series and could not find any.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the tag for Poco's Udon World be changed to correct its spelling?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I left a comment on one of @Mindwin 's questions letting him know of this post.  Perhaps I missed it, but there seemed no way to leave him a private message or email from his user page.


















I often do searches by tag name, manually surrounding the search term by square brackets.  A search for [re:zero] finds no hits, though.  In fact, the colon is auto-removed and the search is actually made for [rezero].  So that is actually what got no hits. Similarly, a search for rezero (no brackets and no inner punctuation) finds no hits, and it probably never will unless someone types it as part of their question or answer.  

Note that if you search without the brackets, then re:zero does find appropriate questions. This is quite fortunate, because that is the actual English name of the series, with the colon.  The results of that search showed me that the tag name is [re-zero], with a dash instead of a colon.

I suggest that the tag [rezero] be created as a synonym for [re-zero].  While it won't solve all search problems concerning the series, it would help some.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the tag [re-zero] be given a synonym [rezero]?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, the tag-searcher (at http://anime.stackexchange.com/tags) is smarter, and will find the tag whether you type in "rezero", "re-zero", or "re:zero".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin Yes, searches for tags is very smart.  It can even find tags when you only used a middle or last word!  What I mean though is use of the normal search at the top of SE's title bar.  Searching for **naruto** will find all posts that use the name, even ones just casually referencing it.  Searching for **[naruto]** will find only the questions to be specifically tagged as being about the series.  Same with **[cowboy-bebop]** (I know to replace spaces with dashes.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unfortunately, SE’s search engine is not as intelligent as the tagging system.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jan I'm not complaining at all.  SE has fantastic features, such as the live preview as you write a question or answer.  I'm sure they're constantly improving.  Until everything is "perfect", the synonym system helps to fill in a gap.  That is why I ask for one here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RichF Oh yes, I fully agree with you. A lot works great on SE and especially the fact that the search actually *respects quotes and asterisks* is worth ten upvotes by itself. However, there are still shortcomings, which I intended to address in my comment just in a matter-of-fact way =)


















A couple months ago, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3949/it was brought up that we should really figure out what to do about the outstanding [identification-request] questions. The immediate impetus for this was probably the realization that [identification-request]  https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3944/was showing up on the front page as one of our top tags despite being blacklisted. Thankfully, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3974/this was fixed pretty quickly. However, the question remains: what, if anything, should we do about the remaining id-reqs?

In https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3959/this post, Logan proposes (as option #4) that they all be retagged to use the tag of the series in question, with the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag removed. For example, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/4122/What manga is this image with a depressed girl from? would be retagged to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watamotewatamote. Gao posted https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3993/another answer in support of this solution. 

I propose that we implement Logan's solution. Note that this will require moderators to do all the retagging, since all the remaining id-reqs are historical-locked - but I'm willing to spend the time doing this, and the other moderators can of course spend the time if they'd like as well. 

If, after a suitable length of time (say, a month or so), people are in agreement with this proposal, I'll start retagging the id-reqs (in small batches, so as not to flood the front page with crap).

This does make it non-trivial to identify the id-reqs that survived the Great Identification Request Cleanup of 2016... http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/672834/unless you use the power of SEDE.



Update (8 Feb 2017): Given that it's been a month and nobody seems to be opposed to this plan, I'm going to start retagging [identification-request] questions in small batches. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Proposal: retag all extant [identification-request] questions to use the tag of the series that was identifiedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While this is difficult to go back from, I think it's a good solutionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This sounds good, but what do we do about ID requests that turned out to be [original art](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/20958/2604), [nonexistent series](http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/22689/2604), or possibly, works that are off-topic for this site (e.g. if I asked an ID request that turned out to have _Code Lyoko_ as the answer)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon Good question. My gut-feel is that there's few enough of those (10-20% is my guess) that we'd still achieve a sizable reduction in [identification-request] questions if we were to just exclude those questions while we implement this proposal. I think that this is a solution that we don't necessarily have to see through to 100% completion for it to be useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5just want to confrim something. would this policy also apply to the id requests we currently allow? such as who is this character parodying or what is this reference from ([example](http://anime.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/34316))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X No, it would not. This strictly applies to the collection of historical-locked, [tag:identification-request]-tagged questions we have. (That said, I have never been wholly convinced that, for example, adding [hokuto-no-ken] to the question you linked would be a bad idea. But that is a topic for another day.)


















I don't like the idea of having a proliferation of these not-really-synonyms, but https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/259377/that horse bolted a long time ago. No point in being a synonym purist on this site, I guess.

[rezero] and some other things https://anime.stackexchange.com/tags/re-zero/synonymsare now synonyms of [re-zero].

This site already uses some advanced technology, so it won't surprise me when the *Search* starts to automatically recognize misspellings and alternative spellings.  That should reduce the manual synonym chasing a lot.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Was the synonym [rezero] removed at some point, do you know? I don't see it listed as a synonym now.


















I want to identify characters from a piece of physical art I purchased.  By taking a photo of it, Google Image search correctly identifies is a Totoro bus stop parody, but I cannot find it on this http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/totoro-bus-stop-parodies/photos/sort/oldestList of Totoro Bus Stop Parodies.  The image is signed "Payer 2008" but I cannot find a DeviantArt site for "Payer" and I cannot find them on various searches involving "Payer" and "Totoro".

I see that identification requests are banned, and I have read the meta posts on it.  My identification request does not seem to fit.  It is not directly from any individual anime or manga, it is not digital so I can't search for an exact match.  Yet I dare not post it using that tag, and I dare not post it without using the tag since that would be disingenuous.

How can I ask this question on the network?

Second, if you have a picture of your physical art, you can ask it using [tag:merchandise] tag (note that you can only ask if you have the picture physically, if it's digital custom art, it's off-topic), add detail like where you bought it and everything that can help us finding what you want, but only if that art is related to anime, otherwise, you can try SciFi.SE or Movie.SEb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry, I meant stackexchange.  You can tell where I spend most of my time. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Darjeeling:  It's a parody though.  I'm not sure if merchandise would accurately cover parodies.

I just posted the following image to the auto-revived question, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/31114/what-defines-the-art-style-of-japanese-mangaWhat defines the art style of Japanese manga?:

 https://i.stack.imgur.com/3xXiB.jpg

I said that, except for his nationality, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Katz_(artist)Jack Katz might as well be considered a mangaka.  (Well, that and it took him 6 months between issues, not 1 (assuming 1 "book" equals 4 manga chapters).) My guess is that The First Kingdom would be off-topic for this site, however. Would it?  If so:

If a Japanese publisher translated it, erased all the nipples, and published it, would it become on-topic manga?
If an anime studio made it into an anime, would the source material be on topic?

(Due to the highly-detailed art style, I doubt #2 would ever occur. But hypothetically...)

When reviewing things in the queue (late answers, low  quality, etc). Clicking an answer brings me to a screen that shows the the answer but the question shown under it but grayed out. 

My question is wouldn't it be easier to be able to see the whole thing with the new answer focused on at first? 

I ask because I have a hard time viewing if an answer was accepted or not unless I open it in a new tab or click it to view the whole thing then click back in my browser to go back to the queue. 

Was something like this implemented in the past? If so why did it become the way it is now? It seems slightly counter intuitive to me.

To start with a bit of history, this site was actually added to the queue for graduation in roughly October/November of 2013 (less than a year after private beta!). At the time there was no procedure for graduating beta sites without creating a custom site design, and the design team was rather understaffed with several other sites ahead of us, so https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1020we had to wait for them to do something. A couple years later in 2015, a procedure was created for graduating sites independent of designs, and this happened https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2594fairly quickly here after the new policy was put in place. If you read that post, you will see that we still expected to wait a few months for a site design, and that in particular the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesreputation thresholds for privileges would remain in place until the new design arrived (most other changes happened immediately). I'm not sure exactly what the reason was for coupling only these two aspects of graduation (some information can be found at https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754Feedback Requested: Design-Independent Graduation and in other MSE posts and meta sites graduating at the same time but there does not seem to be a perfectly clear answer, and even at the time https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754/feedback-requested-design-independent-graduation?noredirect=1&lq=1#comment850181_260762among the community team not everyone agreed), but at the time no one here was complaining much about it since this was a clear improvement over the previous policy.

It's now been well over a year since that announcement. Collectively, we've been waiting over 3 years for a site design (and the corresponding threshold increases), and I've seen no updates recently to suggest that this is any more likely to happen now than it was 3 years ago when we were first contacted by someone in the design team. Meanwhile multiple sites which did not even exist at that time have had designs made. Every other site which was in the queue with us has long-since been designed. Of the newer sites which have been graduated without a design, https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/Code Golf has had the longest wait, and they haven't even been waiting a full year yet. By far we're the most extreme case in the network, and during that 3 year period numerous other changes have happened on this site. When design-independent graduation was first implemented it was never intended to be a long-term state like it has been here, and in such a long-term case it seems to no longer make sense to tie other changes to the design.



To be perfectly honest, I actually don't care very much about the site's design itself (though I certainly can't speak for everyone on this and I think it would not be unreasonable for other users here to be upset about this situation). It would be nice to have a good design, but I understand why it's particularly difficult to come up with something satisfactory for this site. There are at least 3 different groups you have to satisfy with the design. First, questions here are divided, with many questions about popular mainstream series, but still a fairly significant fraction in the long tail of questions on works which few are knowledgeable about. Some users here come only for the big name series like Naruto and Dragon Ball, which obviously tend to attract the most traffic and answers. Others (including me) come almost exclusively for the smaller works, and at least personally I'd argue that this is where we've really improved Q&A coverage versus other sites on the network with overlapping scope such as https://scifi.stackexchange.com/Science Fiction & Fantasy and https://movies.stackexchange.com/Movies & TV. Between these two there is some common ground, but not much. There's also the broader SE community who can end up here in a few ways, and as such we need something at least a bit unique and clearly anime/manga-themed. The strategy used on https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade and Movies was to have a classic look, but I don't think that would work at all here. Other major anime/manga themed sites like https://myanimelist.net/MyAnimeList and https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/Anime News Network have fairly bland designs, but fill in the space with a lot of images of specific works and advertisements, but that wouldn't really work either. My https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/753answer here is basically about the same issue, and I don't think views on this have changed since then.

So I'm not really sure what a good design would look like. It also doesn't seem like the kind of thing that the design team's experience would be likely to help with, because the problems here are intrinsically related to our site's content and scope, not artistic issues, and I doubt anyone on the design team is specifically an expert on our site's content. The one thing I think almost everyone can agree on is that a bad design, which overly emphasizes only a small subset of the community here, would end up worse than our existing look (just imagine if it's designed primarily based on a genre/work that you actively dislike). The current look isn't anything special, but it's perfectly functional and neutral. I don't think creating a design for this site is an impossible problem, but it isn't one that I know the solution to, and the design team seems to have come to the same conclusion. As such (and as they've had plenty of other work to prioritize ahead of us, especially considering the answer https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/283663here which suggests that many more sites may "graduate" to a similar state as ours, allowing the design team to backlog our design effectively indefinitely) it hasn't happened and doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon.



However, if graduation without a design is going to be the de facto standard on this site for years (possibly even forever for all we know at this point), it does not seem reasonable to me to keep the rep thresholds at the low levels of a beta site. Hence, I am requesting that the rep levels be increased to the standard graduated site levels here now, regardless of when (or even if) a design is made for the site. Most importantly, editing would be reserved for 2k users and close voting for 3k users, rather than 1k and 500 respectively on the current site. 

I argued https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/865/almost 3 years ago that we needed more high-rep users to be ready to graduate. In that time, the numbers have changed drastically; now I think we have the opposite problem where we have too many users at the low beta-level rep thresholds. That's not to say that I think any users in particular are doing a bad job, but higher rep users could easily handle everything that comes up, and will on average probably have a better understanding of site policies and what constitutes high-quality content here. I'm also worried that the lower rep thresholds discourage extended participation on the site. Certainly this happened for me, so I'm speaking partly from first-hand experience. Roughly when I hit 10k rep, I decided to stop answering questions which I thought others on the site could handle without me. Without higher rep targets to hit, and with few questions that only I knew the answer to (and many newer users who weren't around since day 1 finding it difficult to gain rep), it was rare to find a situation where I cared to answer. Actually many of the highest rep users on the site are not posting that regularly now, so I don't think I'm alone in this (though this is a separate issue which probably deserves its own meta post). In my case you could partly attribute this to other factors but I think in general if the rep thresholds were higher, we'd overall see more Q&A participation from all users.

I guess this change is probably at least somewhat controversial. Having 20k rep myself I'd be mostly unaffected, but many mid-level rep users would probably be somewhat upset to see their long-held privileges removed suddenly, especially without a site design. However personally I'm convinced that, for the long-term health of this site, this needs to happen eventually regardless of whether we ever get a design, and if it's going to happen anyway it might as well happen now.

The practical effects of our graduation have been removing the "beta" label (mostly inconsequential), moderator elections (where we elected mostly the same people we had during beta as moderators), community ads (okay but mostly inconsequential), and a spot in the footer (nice but not crucial). The biggest functional change of graduation (in the old sense) in the day-to-day workings of the site is the threshold increases, and without those our "graduation" does not really seem complete at all. The design is also a big part, but not an absolutely necessary one in my view.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The topic of Design-Independent Graduation was revisited internally recently, and we're evaluating some options that might further decouple the various moving parts involved. More updates to come as we make progress on this ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Yes, I figured that there might be changes soon when I read the answer at http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/283663. That was part of the reason I posted this now. If changes are going to happen with this process I think this site is a very important example case to consider. Our experience of continuing without a design for so long is quite unique in the network. That either constitutes a failure of the design-independent graduation process (supposed to give the design team more time, not backlog them indefinitely) or a new model for it (where the design is ultimately optional).


















Just as an example, for your consideration.

My personal opinion is with such low activity as we have here, reducing the number of users who are capable of moderating the site will not lead to any benefit. At best only a few users will try to look for things to improve and earn a bit of rep to gain access to the tools they've had before, and at worst (and this is I think the most likely scenario) we'll see a rise of rep-farming activity which will bring down overall content quality, and this is all for basically no good reason.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see your point but I disagree. After banning ID requests our incoming posts are down to 1/3 of what they were before. We don't need many users at all to handle things at 4 Q/D, and I don't see any reason to think that having more changes anything other than slightly delaying closing/deleting posts (not a big deal so long as they're dealt with properly).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for "rep-farming", I'm not actually sure what that constitutes on a site like this (unlike SO). We simply don't have people getting thousands of rep solely by posting low-quality content, and I don't see how you could. To me anything which increases participation is a good thing, and if just posting a lot constitutes "rep-farming" then probably almost all high-rep users are guilty of this. If people are getting rep by making low-quality posts, that's a bigger problem, but it has to do with the voting system, not with moderation options.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is somewhat of a separate problem, but I, personally, don't even know what constitutes good content over here anymore. I hardly see anything I like here anymore. But I do still see a decent amount of garbage that needs to be dealt with, and it's the same five people always dealing with it–and if we lock them out by raising the rep thresholds, the garbage lays around longer. There's probably no longer enough of it to choke the site, but it's still not a good image.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda When would you rather this change happen then? If quality content is becoming rarer (not sure I agree with this appraisal), that doesn't seem like a problem which will fix itself on its own magically in a couple years. It's something that we should try to find a way to improve now. So I don't think the proper solution to this issue (if you do see it as an issue) is just to *continue* waiting for something to change which we don't really know if it will ever happen or what it would look like...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... I also don't think it's likely that the number of users moderating questions will drastically increase any time soon. It seems more plausible to me that if the need arises, some inactive members will step up their game a bit. That said, I'm not saying it will be a completely smooth transition. We may be in for a bit of a rude awakening, and for a few months moderation (especially close voting) may end up a fair bit slower. But it's an awakening that's been put off far too long already in my view, and I can't see any reason to keep putting it off any longer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I don't know. Perhaps I have a skewed view of the site since I solely inhabit that long tail of posts unrelated to Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, and One Punch Man. I'm honestly not sure we'll ever be big enough that I would be satisfied raising the rep thresholds. Speaking solely for myself, as things currently sit, I gain reputation so slowly that if the thresholds were raised I might lose any desire to participate in this site at all and concentrate my energy elsewhere. That's not a threat or anything, it's just something I could foresee happening on its own.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The reputation threshold system's values were calibrated for high activity sites like StackOverflow, which we aren't and we don't have nearly enough activity for users to be able to reach these rep levels in a comparable amount of time and effort. So I don't see why we should try to imitate a **very** different site in this regard. I agree with Torisuda's argument about this effectively locking out some of the active editors out of their available tools being not a good idea.


















So there's been a bit of talk about maybe raising this site's reputation threshold, potentially locking out users out of the privileges they have for now, making them need to re-earn them again.

I would like to propose to let the users keep whatever privileges they have already earned, to avoid possible reduction in their activity (content moderation, editing, etc) because I can totally see that happening on this site with our current state of affairs (not enough activity to be able to re-earn those convenient for editing privileges back in a sane amount of time, and without creating artificial and not really needed questions for the sole purpose of earning rep).

This proposition could go for any other SE site, but here I'm mostly worried about our editors going away if they see their tools taken away for no good reason.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retain earned user privileges after rep requirement threshold raiseb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was going to write an answer, but Shog's answer [here](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/a/867) reflects my opinion on this. If the site is working properly, we don't need many users at the higher rep levels. The most important privileges come at just 15 rep for upvotes and 125 for downvotes. If we need a lot of users at the higher rep levels (which I don't think we do) we are doing something wrong...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dozens of other sites have gone through the same, many with fewer high-rep users than we have, so it's strange to me that the reaction to the change is much more pessimistic here. I think it's probably related to the fact that this strange status-quo with a lot of high-rep users has persisted so long.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're the only user at 20k who won't lose any privileges, also you're a mod on one of the sites, and I might be very biased, so I think we should see what others think of this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not a regular of this site, and my rep is still a low 1k, but I concur with Logan. Losing privileges due to the official rules doesn't discourage me at all. I believe I'd miss 2k-edit privilege, but I still can suggest edit. I'd probably miss close vote privilege, but still, there are 45 users who will retain it (and this site doesn't have backlog on review queue either).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM I can't speak for anyone else, but I'll tell you why I personally am pessimistic about raising the rep levels: because nearly all I do on this site is moderate, and I gain rep at a snail's pace. I started with an association bonus almost three years ago and still haven't cracked 10k. It took me around six months to earn my last 1000 rep. So, at that rate, I'll hit 10k around a year from now, unless I suddenly awaken and decide I love Naruto or something. Then another 4 years until I hit 20k.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've had to accept that my taste in anime and the kinds of questions I'm interested in are enough outside the mainstream that there's hardly anything around I'm capable of or interested in answering, and when I ask I don't get much of a response. I can ask a nothing question on Sci-Fi and Fantasy and get 13 upvotes in a few days, but here, 13 upvotes is my fourth-highest voted question, both because the site is so slow and because I ask questions that no one cares about. And I suspect I'm not the only one in this situation. That's why I'm pessimistic about changing the rep levels.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda:  I've been thinking about that too.  I wonder if we can do something about that...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto I'm out of ideas for how to address it. Just bringing in more users won't help because we get new users every day, but most of them don't contribute good content and I can't see a greater volume helping that. We'd have to target a certain profile of user that contributes quality content, but I don't know where those people hang out or how to lure them in. Previous initiatives to energize our existing users have failed. I and a couple other people have tried asking more complex questions to raise the tone a little, sometimes with self-answers, but this didn't help.


















If we're worried about this, it means one very clear thing:  we're not yet ready to become a fully-fledged site.

Whatever efforts we have to undertake to accomplish this should be our next focus, and should be where our energies are spent.  The rep levels will change, and as has been mentioned before in comments, hasn't had a negative impact on the communities that have fully graduated.

For comparison, the numbers for this transitional period are simply:


453 users with between 200 and 1,999 reputation
13 users with between 2,000 and 3,000 reputation
45 users with 3,000 or more reputation


http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/632943/suggested-beta-reputation-markersQuery

If we want to compare that to a fully fledged site, then these are the milestones we'd need users to have:


Voting up and flagging posts: 15 rep
Voting down: 125 rep
Accessing review queues: 500 rep
Full edit privileges:  2,000 rep
Tag synonyms: 2,500 rep
Casting close/reopen votes: 3,000 rep
Approving tag wiki edits: 5,000 rep
Moderator tools: 10,000 rep
Question protection: 15,000 rep


That would mean...


8415 users can't do much moderation of the site
5464 users can upvote and flag posts
762 users can downvote
152 users can access review queues
10 users have full edit privileges
4 users can create tag synonyms
15 users can cast close and reopen votes
17 users can approve tag wiki edits
6 users can access moderator tools
7 users can protect questions

Note that both of these queries aren't accumulative; they're more hard cutoffs than anything else.  This is meant to give us a rough idea of the picture.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5can you honestly look around at all our accumulated effort here on Anime.SE and say it's not a "real, full-fledged" SE site at this point? I don't think so. In my view, the only thing that separates us from the "bigger" sites is limited capacity for askable questions, because at some point everything a viewer/reader may not be able to understand has been asked and answered, and trying to think of new questions for existing tags will result in asking silly or unnecessary questions that 20 seconds of thinking on your own would answer the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unlike StackOverflow, where code examples, new bugs, etc are found in much larger quantities every day, we have a much smaller capacity for generating warranted upvotes. That's just how it is, and trying to "fix" this by artificially creating unneeded before content is a very bad way to do it IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some users would suggest that we should go out on an upvote rampage, but I don't think it's a good idea. Historically, the effects of calls to "go and vote" have usually been short-lived, and IMO it is the natural flow of things on such a site. Users already have a sense of when they should or shouldn't vote on something and how. This would be trying to solve the problem of low potential upvotable content by creating a problem of bad voting habits.

That said, if JNat says not to worry about it, I'll try not to worry myself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You may be *slightly* misconstruing my point here @Hakase.  I'm not saying that we need to go out and vote all of the things so more people have more rep; that would be silly and fruitless.  I'm also not trying to compare us to Stack Overflow.  There's *no* site in the network that compares to Stack Overflow.  I'm saying, if we're to graduate into a full site with a non-beta skin, we should be acutely aware that we don't quite have a lot of users to help with basic non-diamond moderation of the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In essence, this means we'll lose those more active editors at lower rep.  It's something we're going to have to live with for a while.  But, if we're able to maintain our activity levels and get the word out about this Q&A site somehow (and also somehow stave off the wave of users who still think it's OK to ask for ID requests), then things will work out alright.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright, you didn't say that, but I just wanted to bring it up in case somebody else would think that's what we should do, coz those things were proposed in a related discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It appears your query lists users with rep within brackets between the described and the next requirement, and not from 1 rep to the described earned privilege. Not sure if that's what you intended to do. It's misleading in case you wanna find out how many users have enough total rep up to the described priv threshold.


















I see these pop up on occasion thus we don't really have a problem with them unlike some other kinda of questions we ended up blacklisting. these kind of questions the OP posts a (generally badly/un-formatted) question explaining a theory they've come up with and asking if their theory is right or wrong. these theories generally come from a very limited view point of not having seen all the released material and are mostly just vague speculation. a recent example is this question: https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/39303/1587Re zero my theory about Subaru, The Witch and Amelia

https://i.stack.imgur.com/qoRB5.png

on the one hand i feel as if they are trying to spark a discussion which the Q&A format isn't really for but on the other hand i can see how a question can be answered by a user pointing out all the inaccuracies/flaws (because rarely do i find these questions citing any sources for their theories).

How do we respond to "Is my theory right?" questions? should they be closed as being too broad? (as i said i feel as if they are trying to spark a discussion). or would downvoting for lack of usefulness/lack or backed up research (in the case of wild speculation) be enough
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we respond to "Is my theory right?" questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would not call the questions you linked (apart from the first one) "Is my theory right?"-type questions. Sure, they require a bit of speculation, but ultimately they're asking about the work itself, not about a particular fan theory. Something like http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2555 or http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/116 could be considered "Is my theory right?" though. But in those cases the theory was already notable elsewhere, and had a good chance of having some kind of official answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM if your talking about the list of links those are what i believe examples of questions that was answered by logically speculating on plot elements using other plot elements and/or real world references, a "this is my theory"-type answers, just to point out that i am aware that we do allow speculative answers (so long as they are backed up my some sort of evidence). if they however make things confusing i am happy to remove themb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My point is that speculation in answers is very different from speculation in questions. It's not too difficult to write a good speculative answer, but good speculative questions are relatively rare.


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/34246/why-is-trunks-not-as-powerful-as-gohan-when-they-are-both-human-saiyan-hybridsthis question was about why Trunks didnt have the same power as Gohan when they are both saiyan-human hybrids. This was true in Dragon Ball Z, but now in Dragon Ball Super they made Trunks to be the first to get the super saiyan rage transformation, that by the time he gets it for the first time, it makes him able to fight Goku Black super saiyan rose, something that Goku and Vegeta couldnt do by that time (later with training and power from becoming angry and kaioken, Goku and Vegeta can also be a match to Goku Black super saiyan rose, or overpower him, but after Trunks did it for the first time) 

The topic was first flagged because it was marked only "Dragon Ball Z" (so what could happen in Dragon Ball Super wouldnt count), and probably also because many people didnt like and couldnt accept at first the fact of how strong Trunks became so quickly, at first people was even having doubt if he had a new transformation, there was much noise about it for some weeks when these episodes appeared, one member who flagged said the answer "wasnt credible". 

But later how powerful Trunks became was reaffirmed in the following episodes, even being the one who defeats merged Zamasu at the end. So the right answer is deleted, and I assume that if I post the same post again is going to get deleted again? 

I ask you to reconsider undeleting the answer, so the topic can have a meaningful answer. Or post one yourself with the info I just posted here. 

By the way, the answer isn't a one liner, it's 2 lines and there isn't much to add to the answer to explain it, perhaps that Trunks got a new transformation no one else got before, and that he showed to have hidden power as Gohan had
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The right answer to a topic is in a post that was deletedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[this is a screenshot of the deleted answer](https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2A5d.png) for those without the rep to see itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Two lines isn't much better than one line. I don't follow the series but I think you probably should add source like which chapter/episode were you referring to or add some pictures.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a difference between a claim and an answer. Your one line claim doesn't add much in way of an answer. Sure, it is now reaffirmed, but at that time, it is no more a claim. You may however now add supporting evidence (i.e, episode numbers, details and proofs) about when, where and HOW what you claim is actually right. And then **now** _that_ is an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, if you post the exact same post again, it will be deleted again, but if you post a longer, better explained post around the same idea, but with more details and citations, following the advice in кяαzєя's answer, it won't be deleted. As far as I know, Dragon Ball Z and Super are in the same continuity, so that's not a valid reason to delete an answer and I would vote to undelete if that were all, but the answer you posted is just way too short and doesn't even do basic diligence like mentioning an episode number or a scene that supports its claim.


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/39501/what-if-someone-in-one-piece-eats-a-devil-fruit-that-makes-him-her-an-outstandinThis question is written posed as a hypothetical that reads as opinion-based. They literally start by asking for the reader to imagine. On the other hand, it just happened that there was a canon answer to it, which seems to be more by chance than anything else. There are close votes for it being too opinion-based which, while being legitimate, would block off access to a good and decently upvoted answer. What should we do with questions like this? Should we have them rewrite the question so it's not hypothetical? Should we close the question for not meeting our standards?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What do we do with questions presented as hypothetical but with real answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related discussion from some months ago: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3915/.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My personal opinion is that "Primarily Opinion Based" is used far too often as a way to close interesting questions that are somewhat hypothetical but grounded in factual content. Questions like this which are quite answerable seem to support that viewpoint. Reading the top answer on the post @senshin linked, I can't see how "answers to this question will tend to be *almost entirely* based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise." In fact the present answer is basically the exact opposite.


















Well, I'm in sort of a bind on this one. 

As I wrote in my answer to the question senshin linked (https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3916/7579this one), I have a problem with the way we've handled hypothetical questions in the past. I feel like we've been too quick to stomp on them with the big spiked boots of "primarily opinion based". I feel like we've sometimes been too uptight about standards of evidence, in ways more fitting to a math or science site than to an anime site. I get why we've been that way, but I think we should stop interpreting everything so narrowly and allow a little wiggle room, a little space for judgment to take over, a little scope for creative and fun answers that use lateral thinking. I favor using the "Do you have any reason to think this aside from just pulling it out of your ass?" test: if a post can't pass that bar, close it, but if it's pretty much within the rules of the universe, give it a little latitude.

On the other hand, that question. If you take away the answer and just read the question itself, it doesn't come across as a question asked in good faith. It comes across as the user who asked it going "Tee hee, look at the loophole I came up with, aren't I clever?" 

Still, I think it's as much within the One Piece universe as questions like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/33621/could-a-blind-person-with-a-death-note-exchange-half-their-life-to-see-againCould a blind person with a death note exchange half their life to see again? is within the Death Note universe, or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/38503/why-was-the-world-of-sao-not-dominated-by-good-real-life-fencersWhy was the world of SAO not dominated by good real-life fencers? (which, by the way, I really hated, since for me it was way too close to the border of the "ass pull" rule, but I did not vote to close it) is within the Sword Art Online universe. That is, in principle, there could be an answer to be found, either within canon, with some creative reapplication of principles found in canon, or in the last resort by going out of universe, and if we can't find such an answer, it's because we don't have enough information, which, as I argued on the other question, should be an acceptable answer for cases like this. (The Death Note question I linked is actually answered exactly in this way: there's not enough information, and the accepted answer says so.) But for this question, we don't even need to go that far, because we do have kaine's answer from within canon which strongly suggests that no such Devil Fruit can exist.

So, even though I think it's kind of an obnoxious question, and I'm not convinced the questioner meant it in good faith, I think we should ignore that and reopen it. Maybe some edits to the wording could make it less come off less "Look at me I'm so clever" and make it seem more on-topic.

If it was edited to be something like "is x addressed in canon or can it be answered using canon rules" I would be okay to reopen it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly Yeah, that's part of what I meant about the question coming off as someone trying to look clever. I'm going to see what I can do about making the wording less annoying.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm thinking the best option for something like this would be to edit and reopen.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@kuwaly I made some edits to remove the "imagine with me" wording and voted to reopen.


















I would go with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rakugo-shinjurakugo-shinju because the OP has never seen the name https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/descending-storiesdescending-stories.


  @Makoto I have never ever see the name "Descending Stories" until you mention it. I bet nobody will recognize by this tags. But can't you use just Showa-Rakugo?


If a need ever arises (I doubt it since it's not a widely known series), we can always tag the English name as a synonym following the usual https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/suggest-tag-synonymsprocedure of suggesting a tag synonym (4 upvotes from users with a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In practice, I don't think we've ever created a tag synonym with that procedure here; it certainly isn't common in any case. More commonly, we have to get a mod to create the synonym (as senshin did in this case). Really the synonym system needs some work, but that's probably the topic for a different meta post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, what Logan said - I'm almost certain the user-voting approach to creating a synonym has never worked here (simply for lack of users, never mind users that actively check the tag synonym voting pages). If you want a synonym for anything other than, like, Naruto or something, post on meta or flag for moderator attention and one of us will put the synonyms in.


















I made a similar question about this before, but since I didnt get an answer, I'll try to explain differently this one.

Can questions about fanfics or comics based on official released Anime or Manga be made in anime SE?

I believe some of them are already being made (such as questions about the One Punch Comic free webseries, the original, not the paid manga) 

I'm interested on this, because some animes are borrowing ideas from fanfics/ fan made comics , and then you want to ask something else about them (right now I cant remember the name of a DB fanfic/comic and I would like to ask its name)

Besides, how can you tell a fanfic/comic is not "manga". If manga simply means japanese comic, wasnt the One Punch Man webseries "manga" before it was released as a paid manga? And if manga simply means "comic" for japanese, wouldnt a fanfiction/comic based in anime would be manga for them? and therefore for us since we borrowed from them the word?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can questions about fanfics or comics based on official released Anime or Manga be made in anime SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I _think_ we've generally been permissive about stuff that hasn't been "officially" published yet (like webtoons and webnovels). These are, however, distinct from fanfics/etc in that they are not _derivative_ works. We have a pretty clear bright-line way of distinguishing fanworks from non-fanworks. I have a strong gutfeel that we should _not_ have questions about fanworks. Note that the "original" OPM comic is not excluded under this rule, because it is not a derivative of any other existing work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(Side note: I don't think it is useful for us to think deeply about the definitions of the words "anime" and "manga" when determining what questions we should and shouldn't allow. "Originalism" in the sense of "what would a Japanese speaker mean when they say _anime_?" is particularly un-useful given that "anime" and "manga" are reasonably well-assimilated English words with their own senses nowadays.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yeah, you better dont because I just asked a japanese and any fanfic for them is manga.


















I've noticed that, at least in the past few weeks if not longer, we've had a fairly large number of music ID requests, especially compared to the number of non-music ID request questions. I'm having a hard time dealing with exact numbers because I'm on mobile, but of the most recent half dozen or so I've looked at, the person is new not only to Anime SE but also to SE in general, asks no other questions, and has a question that basically boils down to "at x time or in x scene in y show, what music is playing".

While this doesn't have the normal ID request problem of being answerable through reverse image search (though not all ID request questions did either), it seems to be having some of the other issues that we had with those questions, which in the end were determined to be off-topic. So I guess what I'm asking is, should we keep these questions on-topic, and if so what are they contributing to our site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should music requests stay on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5what issues do music id request share with others? with general id requests the flood of bad ones have very little details to be identifiable and overly generic while most image only ones could easily be solved with a reverse image search.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Memor-X As I mentioned, the problem (discussed in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3874/why-are-identification-request-questions-not-allowed-on-this-site/3879#3879 for regular ID requests) of people who seem to make their account just to ask this and don't ask anything else. They also seem to be, as the second answer talks about, of relatively limited use--it's not clear how many people will want to know the song from 1 minute of episode 240 of Naruto (as a random example).


















I find myself largely agreeing with what senshin is saying, but I do have...a bit of an issue with both music identification as a whole which was exposed thusly:


  Every Stack Exchange site has its long tail of mundane "workhorse" questions; music identification questions are shaping up to be ours, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.


It doesn't feel like these sorts of questions do a lot to grow the site, realistically speaking.  "Workhorse" or not, they don't really inspire me to answer them at all.  This mentality would have a direct negative impact on the site, as it means that I wouldn't engage with the questions being posed.  Suppose then if the entire front page were questions about music; I couldn't engage with the site in any way I wanted to.

However, because they at least satisfy my requirements of:


being reasonably scoped,
being specifically about a single piece of work, and
are often asked in context to a single episode or some single work on the OST,


...I'll begrudgingly let them stay on topic.  I do expect this to shift in the future though, since I don't doubt that there are a number of folks who don't really want to answer this type of question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it starts becoming a problem like it did with ID request, we'll ban them too. For now though it seems like much less of an issue. Worst case we'll have a complete music score for each title with links to soundtrack albums on amazon. Doesn't sound as bad to me as infinite unidentifiable anime character images.


















I have heard of a post, question, or meta process to request new tags for new anime, but I looked around and did not find it.

All Stack Exchange sites start out https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/whats-betain "beta" and look the way ours does. After a site achieves sufficient activity, it https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257614/"graduates". It used to be that graduation was always accompanied by snazzy designs like the ones you've posted, but https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/263905/that changed about two years ago so that getting a snazzy design comes some time after graduation.

Our site has graduated (so, for example, you don't see "beta" in our site header like you would on, say, https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/Alcohol.SE), but does not yet have a design. Creating a new design for a Stack Exchange site is a labor-intensive process, and Stack Overflow (the company) has only limited resources. We are somewhere in the queue for getting a design - it'll happen eventually. 

We are a reasonably popular site compared to Stack Exchange as a whole, but if you go to http://stackexchange.com/siteshttp://stackexchange.com/sites and sort by whatever metric you'd like, you'll see that there are sites that are more active than us that also don't have a design (you can tell because their icons are generic blue speech bubbles). 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll be waiting for a nice design. And thanks for answering : )b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Given more recent information, I'm no longer sure that "it'll happen eventually" is the official stance. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/ suggests that the new requirement for a design is "10 questions per day", which we have not come close to since removing ID requests. Other posts have suggested that a lot more sites may have the "beta" label removed in the near future without getting site designs, and we may be retroactively moved in that group. So it seems consistent with that information that we may no longer be in the queue to get a design in the future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM You raise a good point. Our questions/day has been hovering around 5-7 for about a year now, so in that sense, I agree that at this moment, we do not meet all the criteria for getting a design. However, many of our other site metrics (page views, new registrations, anonymous feedback) have been steadily rising over the past 6-12 months, so I'm inclined to suspect that our current low questions/day is a transient phenomenon that should resolve itself eventually and put us back up above 10 questions/day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Side note: some sites, like TCS.SE or the various CRM sites, are intrinsically limited in the number of questions/day they can receive by the nature of their subject matter. The "intrinsic" limit on the number of anime & manga questions that can be asked per day is probably somewhere well above 10/day, so I'm not worried about us being saturated just yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Relevant context: [*The last time a site design went live: October 5, 2016... That was Signal Processing.*](http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5947471#5947471) and [*Sites which have graduated but not yet get site design: Quant, Mechanics, Law, Philosophy, Codegolf, Anime.*](http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5947469#5947469)


















That would be a superbad version of the ID request we already don't like. Not only you don't have the original screenshot/scan of the image, but it might be distorted by your imperfect recollection. That's not useful for anyone other than yourself, and that's exactly the type of question the SE network doesn't want to attract.

But for such a case, I'd recommend delving deep into your browser's history and maybe looking through cached images that may have been saved somewhere on your computer. Maybe you'll be able to find some clues about where you saw it.

If it's from an ad block on a specific site, you may have luck finding it by updating the page, getting new ads.

It's an American film made in the style of mecha anime; it has giant robots called Jaegers who fight kaiju (monsters similar to Godzilla).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No actually I found it...it was Attack On Titan. By the way I have seen Pacific Rim too. Thanks a lot anyways : )


















In the chat room a while back we discussed possibly of jump starting the whole design thing ourselves by creating a userscript, one which we can then alter to have different themes so that way those of us who wanted a Naruto or Dragoball Z can still get it without people getting upset. well i had some time to fiddle around doing it myself using https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=enStylebot on Chrome basing it on https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/what-should-our-site-design-look-like/728#728Eric's Designs (https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEKa2.pngthis one)

this is very much a work in progress and at this stage i'm just trying to emulate Eric's design into something that's complete that we can mess with later. once that's done we can decided discuss what changes will be made for us to promote this as the site's main theme and make a separate Meta for where we post our template/base CSS and all our different themes.

Since the end result is an Unofficial Theme and not endorsed by Stack Exchange i can not grantee if this will still work/be supported if/when we do get our proper design and remember that the script only changes the site's look on you're own machine, everyone else will either see the current design or whatever design they might be using with their own user script so with that said

TO THE STACK EXCHANGE DESIGN TEAM: we do still want to see an official design

Personally question shouldn't really need to be edited. using Code Geass as an example the question "Is Lelouch dead or alive after R2" is fine regardless if R3 existed or not.
though i would agree to edits to update where a question talks about the general end of the series when a new season of the series is exists eg.

"is Ed trapped in our world at the end of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime" => "is Ed trapped in our world at the end of the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist anime series" after Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood came out
"What happened to Hei at the end of Darker than Black" => "What happened to Hei at the end of Season 1 of Darker than Black" after Darker than Black: Ryuusei no Gemini came out


Answers on the other hand are trickier because we shouldn't be rewriting other people's answers. so

if you're own answer is outdated you can edit it with an updated answer
if you know an answer is outdated you can comment on the answer to let the poster know that it's outdated for whatever reason
you can post a bounty. there is a reason when setting a bounty which specifies outdated answers and wanting something more up to date
you can post a new updated answer and possibly link to an existsing answer saying something like

http://www.test.com[USER]'s answer was accurate/correct at ##/##/#### however since Season # new information contradicts this



there should really be no need to be making edits to other people's answers saying something like

This question was posted ##/##/### which at the time was correct as there was no Season #

because all non-community wiki answers have the date of when the answer was posted.
and personally when i answered Code Geass questions i did so after the series was finish1 and wouldn't want people updating my answers themselves while the season is on-going, which as we have seen with a certain Dragon Ball Super answer when users start trying to update information based off the last information that was just aired which is quickly contradicted in the next episode (also the answer was made before Super was conceived in the first place)
unless it was a community wiki answer it should have been an edit with the answerer deciding if they should update it then or wait until it's been confirmed

1: don't bother pointing out the Julius Kingsley thing. i am aware of that and thought the OVA was finished when i posted. i did update my answers when i learned a new OVA was out which revealed who he actually was

Minor edits that do not break the spirit of the answer (link rot patrol, typos) are fine IMHO. 3) Much appreciated, senpai.


















I know that generally, scanlation & fansub are considered illegal, and I have no problem with that.

Now, I recently stumbled upon this question (again): https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/30061/where-can-i-continue-reading-battle-through-heavenWhere can I continue reading Battle Through Heaven?. I noticed that there's a deleted answer mentioning a link to the scanlated version. At first, I thought that's reasonable to be deleted.

Now, after revisiting the https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=110706MangaUpdates link, I realized that it's actually a Chinese webcomic (http://www.chuiyao.com/manhua/3670/link) that anyone can access, and it made me questioning about the scanlation, since not everyone understand Chinese.

So, is the policy the same with general scanlation & fansub (e.g. forbid them since they're illegal)? Is there any exception to answering this kind of question with link to scanlation & fansub?

*I don't contest the deletion of that answer, since a comment on that answer gave a good reason to be deleted (it links to other illegal scanlation/fansub)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Freely accessible manga/anime (e.g. webcomic, online anime) and scanlation/fansubb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems to be one of the rare exceptions that has been missed by the reviewers. I suppose we could reinstate the answer and add that it's a free comic and the link is fine on our site.


















My Opinion is to err on the side of caution. The Manga/Novel/Manwha may be freely accessible now but we don't know if that will always be. there are some legal sites which provide some chapters free but either hide the rest behind a paywall or remove the free chapters after so long.
an example is with Shounen Jump on Viz. as we can see https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/dragon-ball-superDragonball Super and https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/kurokos-basketball?utm_source=Email_marketing&utm_campaign=Shonen_Jump_Email_May_08_2017&cmp=1&utm_medium=HTMLEmailKuroko's Basketball some chapters were offered for free but has since expired. Now while the examples may be English Licensed Manga i'm not sure if it's the same in Japan for stuff not licensed in English and if they do we don't want people posting links full translations of chapters which aren't free just because a couple were.
however even if a web comic/novel is available fully for free by the writer themselves or on a site they still have the right to then not make it free, especially when if it because of a publishing agreement. an example i have is The Legend of the Sword of the Day and the Sword of the Night, a Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha fanfiction which was freely available in spanish and was translated to english. however http://nanofate.us/sword?page=11#comment-39862the translation was taken down when it got published

I got contacted moments ago by Nura, the author of this book, and she just confirmed me that she finally signed the publishing contract for this book, so congratulations again to her for this accomplishment. We're going to have to take down the English translation of her novel as we agreed to avoid problems, so if you're still reading it you have until the 30 of June before we edit out all the translations in this thread, if you don't think you will have enough time to finish I think you can make a local copy for you, as long as you don't re-upload it.
The book is going to come out with the title "La Profecía de las Espadas" in two volumes since it's so long, and of course in Spanish only as far as I know. If you want more information ask Nura.

now if we allowed posting unofficial translations on third party sites when The Legend of the Sword of the Day and the Sword of the Night was free then when it got published we would either

have to edit the link out of the answer which we can and would do, however that would mean someone would need to either remember that we have the link or we get a notification from the copyright owner in some way.

rely that the linked site is decent enough so that the link is invalidated in some way, the very least have a different landing page. generally not a problem if the author hosts the translation themselves and then pulls it themselves




I know that generally, scanlation & fansub are considered illegal

while yes you are right i would like to use this to point out when a scanlation (if you call it that) is legal. a good example is Yuri-ism who, while does translation of Shoujo Ai/Yuri Doujinshi and makes them freely avalible, have partnered with Isya (434notfound) to help translate her Shoujo Ai/Yuri doujinshi for English and sell it on Fakku and DLSite (the latter not allowing uncensored stuff and it seems Isya wants it to be uncensored). to quote the post on site by Chansu for the release of Rules of Zero  Chapters 1 and 2 (i wont put up a link but understand there is NSFW stuff)

After a long time waiting, we're finally able to announce our next collaboration with Isya (434notfound). We will be publishing her original manga series "Rule of Zero" for you all. We have two chapters ready for you now, and you can expect two more to be ready by the end of April/early May. If you're new to the site or don't remember. Over a year ago we reached out to Isya to help her release her works legally in English to the west. It's been a learning experience for us all, but it's been an amazing one.

most of Yuri-ism's releases would be scanlations that we shouldn't be posting links to so in the above case it would be ok to be talking about Yuri-ism's work but the links to Isya's stuff should be the product pages where you buy (with NSFW Warnings) and avoid linking to Yuri-ism itself
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5to add Isya's first release with Yuri-ism wasn't an original work but a PreCure Shoujo Ai/Yuri Doujinshi


















As I've seen, there's created a tag for some animes from Visual Arts / Key, and also, the Key tag itself.

My proposal, for better searching, are reassign all questions on tags from Visual Arts animes (for example, air, kanon), to the key tag, and also the original tsgs.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/40554/protecting-your-mangaThis is an interesting question, because it describes several real-world things:


Owning paper manga
Wanting to keep the condition of the manga as high as possible for future ownership reasons
It has a really nice answer, too


...but I want to be sure that this is the kind of question we want to keep around here.

Why we should


Asking questions around how to ensure low wear and tear on collectibles is a viable subject. Ensuring that we can preserve our manga collections with useful tidbits is always beneficial.
Asking questions about bonuses or hidden features of material goods related to anime and manga can be seen as an entry point to talking about it more.


Why we shouldn't


It's a meta discussion on anime and manga itself.  We're not talking about series, but the actual physical goods.
This may lead down the slippery slope of asking where we could find something, at almost the same volume as identification questions.
I'm not sure we're really built for it; we've not built ourselves as a Q&A about figurines or service items, even though we do permit some series-related discussion on it.


Thoughts?  If we want to keep these kinds of questions around, what should the tag be for them?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are we comfortable with allowing questions pertaining to the ownership of anime/manga and its related goods?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be honest I was considering closing the question you linked to, partly because it was obviously reducible to the more general question of how books can be maintained (which isn't on-topic here). I wasn't sure though, and I might feel differently after seeing some other opinionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon It is not obvious to me that advice given generally for books would still be the best possible advice for manga. If we are talking about manga from Japan, most publishers use very cheap newsprint for magazines. *Tankōbon* are printed on higher quality printing paper. In both cases the paper is not just standard book paper. Additionally, the graphic nature of the format means different types of ink are used.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: the "slippery slope" point - we should probably have a meta discussion about that, because we do get questions about "how do I watch X" or "where do I get the BDs for Y" and we don't seem to treat them all that consistently.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin:  Yeah, I've noticed those lately too.  Would be worth drumming up a discussion about it.



















I think your first point in the "Why we shouldn't" should be in "Why we should".
Second point in "Why we shouldn't" is a typical shopping question, which is basically prohibited by default on most SE sites for the obvious reason of there being infinite products on any given topic and we're not a shopping recommendation site.
Sure we're built for it! Take a look at other SE sites where they have some questions like that, but on their topic.


We could probably expect there to be a total of ~100 non-duplicate "meta"-questions about preserving figurines, posters, mangas and dvds/blurays, which isn't that big a number if you consider how many ID requests we've sifted through over the years. And it would be actually useful information for a lot of unique visitors, unlike IDs.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I confess that these are more or less weakly-held views from my part.  I don't disagree with your rearrangement, but at the same time I'd like to be wholly convinced one way or the other as to whether or not these questions are viable here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMO until we can gather up a strong case one way or another, we shouldn't rush to prohibit anything. (in my previous comment iteration I wrote a bunch of words that basically rehash my post, so that's deleted now :p)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was wondering about that, haha.  But it sounds like your conventional thinking on this is consistent with how we've dealt with a lot around here; don't make it into a problem until it's a problem.  I did want to take a more proactive role though in checking if the community felt strongly one way or another on this, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I come from a lot of Wikipedia work where the general idea there too is don't make it into a problem until it is a problem. I think talking about the physical medium of manga/anime discs is not out of our range here, and I also think they're useful questions/answers to have as well, even if perhaps they're not quite specific to anime/manga itself (like the one OP linked). Beyond the not quite specific thing, though, I can't really think of any downsides, and I feel it'd be a bit weird to discuss anime/manga while disregarding the fact that we digest them in the format of books and episodes.


















There are a number of SE sites which have some relevant to the topic of the site icons, symbols and graphics in the header or the repeating background pattern. I'm not exactly sure how much our designers are in on the anime topic, but just to give them some ideas, I'd like to compile a list of things that our community thinks are, if not stereotypically representative, then at least noteworthy, and should be included or used as a reference for symbols in our site's theme.

https://movies.stackexchange.com/Movies&TV has posterized iconic imagery from well known movies, so I guess it's not out of the question to have basically the same type of deal here, but in a different style of execution. Like a background pattern of iconic imagery, as I'm suggesting.

Some anime don't have a recognizable symbol, but rather  a character's silhouette, like in case of Mushishi, so I doubt it would be easy to find something from them to fit into 40 pixels or less.

Here are my lists, but please post your own answer if you have something to add:

Generic anime/Japan themed things:


a schoolgirl biting a toast running late to school
Sakura petals

cicadas definitely
samurais, ronins and ninjas, which are also prominent in many anime, and so are their katanas, headbands and throwing knives, stars, shurikens, kunais
daruma doll
kotatsu
vending machines with countless varieties of tea, black coffee and unusually flavored drinks
shaved ice

We've (Stack Exchange Inc.) recently received a DMCA takedown notice for several posts from this community. As a result of that, I'm taking down around 15 posts at this very moment (got a script running), but many more might need to be removed over the coming week. This means some reputation is probably gonna be lost, and also that some good content is gonna vanish. The DMCA process tells us we must notify the author of the content, which means the author of the questions will get a comment notifying them of the occurrence — however, whoever answered any of the deleted questions is just gonna be left wondering why they lost rep, and why the post was even deleted in the first place. So here I am, preemptively notifying the community as a whole as a courtesy.
So what can I do if my question was deleted due to this?
If you own one of the posts that were removed, you will have a comment left on it by me notifying you of why the post was deleted. You can then, if you believe you are the wrongful subject of a copyright takedown notice, http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/responding-dmca-takedown-notice-targeting-your-contentfile a DMCA counter-notice through https://stackexchange.com/legal/terms-of-service#designatedagentthe proper channels — and hopefully we'll be able to restore the content!
You can find the DMCA notice https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/14438003here, at Lumen database (or https://lumendatabase.org/notices/14712591here, since Lumen lost the original one for some reason, and are trying to make this new one point to the older link).
Given that most of the posts are over 60 days old, they won't show up in your profiles at all — so feel free to reach out to the Community Team using https://anime.stackexchange.com/contact/contact if you require any assistance.

Disclaimer: none of this is official legal guidance; it's just provided as a courtesy :)


Update: concerns & questions
BIG thanks to everyone who responded here - as you can probably tell, this isn't something we've had a lot of experience dealing with, so identifying areas for improvement is extremely helpful.
We're not done working on this. As you noticed, only 17 of the 190+ links have been removed as of this time, and we're hoping this whole thing will have a happy outcome. Hopefully, we'll be able to resolve this in a way that's acceptable to both the folks sending this take-down notice and the authors who've donated their time and knowledge here; as with most legal things, this isn't likely to be fast, but we'll do our best to keep you updated.
Here are the open questions you've asked that we're gonna try & figure out answers to. Again, no guarantees on when (or even if) we'll actually be able to do that - but, we're gonna try:

https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/296630/208518Who is responsible for DMCA takedown counterclaims on authorless / disassociated / CW posts?
Given that a lot of our content is collaborative, it’s not obvious who can legally challenge DMCA notices, so:

Who "owns" the content, and can file counter-notices?
A question author only?
Or is an answerer or editor entitled to that too?


Can the posts on which no action was taken (yet) be edited to try to minimize this (by editing out links or properly attributing images)?
Can the post owner edit their deleted post before filing the counter-claim to aid its validity?
Given the shared ownership of the content (asker, answerers, editors) who are we (SE) required to notify?
Are users who file a counter-notice required to give out details like their real name, or can they use their online pseudonym?

And how much of the information provided in the counter-notice will be made public vs how much of it will just be used internally to assess validity of the counter-notice?



Again, thank you all for your patience and insights.

I'm calmer now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A further question for you to bring to the lawyers: In a case like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3112/how-much-of-the-original-material-is-animated-in-first-season-of-maoyuu-maou-yuu, where the question was deleted presumably due to the content of one answer which would not be much of a loss to the site, can the OP counter-notice requesting that the question and other answer be reinstated without contending the copyright claim on the potentially infringing answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The original Lumen Database link is no longer accessible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Huh, weird @Killua. I wasn't able to find it through search either — I just reached out to Lumen directly via email to ask what might have happened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looks like the notice was nuked out of existence for some reason, @Killua. I sent the details to Lumen again, and they should put it back up with the same number :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat Looks like it's fixed. Thanks!


















Is StackExchange going to offer any assistance with this? 

I don't appreciate SE rolling over to Aniplex, etc and just deleting my content rather than standing up for its users and its content - which are both the very being of Stack Exchange. How are our users, who are individuals supposed to individually contest against giant conglomerates who have entire legal teams?

Why is StackExchange running scripts for automatic copyright flag and removal, when it should be up to the copyright holders to point out why each post is infringing? 
(Redacted due to an incorrect assumption of the script's purpose)

This is setting an ugly precedent, personally I believe the majority of the posts that I have seen should fall under fair use - will Movies & TV, Literature, etc also be burden to over-reaching 3rd party companies? 

Why not offer a nicer alternative and edit out any infringing material?

Also, many of our users are non-US residents, like myself - It says in the link provided that filing a counter-notice for people like me is actually something that I probably don't want to do. How can I fight this then?

Please can StackExchange offer more than a token post and offer some real support?

Wouldn't removing the image (and another from some other user's answer) be enough?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jahu these removal claims seem to be targeted at specific post IDs and not specific revisions, so there's nothing that says "we don't want anyone to see this specific content" but instead "this whole post must be deleted", at least that's what details I've seen so far. Reposting as a new edited question could be the solution but I don't think we should rush to action until we get some official SE info. Let's wait at least a couple days to hear something from them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Fwiw, CMs and moderators have the ability to redact individual revisions from the revision history so that they are no longer visible, so it is *technically* possible to e.g. fix a post in an edit then remove all access to the old versions entirely (*legally* I have no idea what the implications are).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The DMCA safe harbor protections provide limited remedies for content hosts and we will pursue any such remedies to their fullest extent where warranted.

Over several URLs that becomes a tedious string of button pushing - the script automates this process given a list of valid complaint URLs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@animuson thanks for clearing that up, i'll redact it


















A couple important problems here regarding the effectiveness of this post in notifying authors of their counterclaim options (TL;DR: A meta post alone might not be enough). I pulled info about all the reported posts:


https://github.com/JC3/SEUserScripts/tree/master/misc/dmcaInfo script and list of posts
http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/678784/dmca-related-reports?AccessDays=30A messy SEDE query


In general, here is the breakdown of Anime meta access activity (https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/293155/230261see also):

Total Users:                16043 [a]
Accessed Last 30 Days:       1537 [b]
Also on meta last 30 days:     97     (0.60% of [a], 6.31% of [b])
On meta, ever:               1858
Never accessed meta, ever:  14185


It's pretty low, but, more importantly, here are those stats for the authors of those posts (original authors of questions and answers, plus original authors and all editors for tag wikis):

Total Authors:                148 [a]
Accessed Last 30 Days:         52     (35.1% of [a])
Also on meta last 30 days:     20     (13.5% of [a]) 
On meta, ever:                 79     (54.5% of [a])
Never accessed meta, ever:     69     (46.6% of [a])


So this raises a few concerns:


Issue #1: Given that about 65% of the involved authors have not accessed the main site in the past month, it seems unlikely to expect them to contest. What should be done about this?


Suggestion: Notify all authors via email about their options.

Issue #2: Given that only about 14% of the involved authors have accessed meta in the past month, it seems unlikely to expect them to read this post. That is, this post may not be an effective way to spread this information (also consider low % of total users that visit meta). Additionally, any given user has no direct way of knowing that their post is part of the claim without cross checking the rather large list against all their own posts, by ID. What should be done about this?


Suggestion: Post an automated comment on each of these posts (not just ones that have been deleted) linking to this meta post (not applicable to tag wikis) and stating the issue. 



This should maximize communication effectiveness, by providing both an inbox notification for active authors, as well as an email notification for inactive ones (that's the best effort that can be made, I think).

Note: The claim lists /questions/id links. It is unclear if they're referring to just the question, or the entire collection of questions with answers. Of course removing a question implies removing the answer but from the context of the claim it's unclear what is being claimed so it's probably best to assume that everything visible on each post (questions and answers) are subject. In that case it may also make sense to do the email and comment notifications on each answer on each of those posts as well. If the claim includes the answers it seems you'd be obligated to notify the authors of the answers, too, as they are content authors.

A similar concern may be valid for tags (do they mean the tag entry, or do they mean all posts containing that tag?).

Also, there's another bit of vagueness:


Issue #3: There are two posts whose authors no longer have accounts. Both are well-received and are definitely, imho, contestable. Who can contest these?


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/77How much time has passed in-universe in Detective Conan?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14812What's the tune that Noel is humming in Sora no Method?
Suggestion: Unknown. Does SE owns this content now? Should SE file the counterclaims for these two posts? The copyright counterclaims section of https://stackexchange.com/legalthe TOS does not cover this scenario.



Given the http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/6069498#6069498unfortunate fact that:


  JNat: The content provider (SE) cannot contest the validity of the claim, and are required to take action unless the request is not properly formatted.


I believe it becomes philosophically and morally important to make sure a best effort is made to contact authors and a meta post alone unfortunately doesn't seem to have adequate visibility.



List of Posts By Author

Along those lines, to make it easier to see if your posts are in this list (this is a list of all posts in the claim, it doesn't necessarily mean the posts were removed), here is:


A list of https://github.com/JC3/SEUserScripts/blob/master/misc/dmca/contributors_questions_tags.mdall questions and tag wikis by author / editor, and 
A list of https://github.com/JC3/SEUserScripts/blob/master/misc/dmca/contributors_answers.mdall answers by author/editor. 


Look at both lists, find your user name, and your posts will be listed there. I'll certainly be filling out my counterclaim forms for my posts if they end up removed. If your username contains non-Latin characters, check the end of the lists, too.

This seems ambiguous to me in a case like this where our content is provided by multiple users ("subscribers") on almost every page. One possible reading is that everyone who has contributed to the page can file a counter-notification. However I am not a lawyer, and I don't think anyone but a lawyer can answer this definitively.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice, thanks for that link. Also, just to be clear, whether the current meta post constitutes acceptable effort, legally, isn't my issue (I'm not even sure, and I don't have enough coffee in me to attempt to check that out, plus I trust SE's legal staff). Specifically, I only think that *realistically* this won't reach enough authors on its own, and it would be a *nice* thing to do to take an extra step to reach out more effectively.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure but is it the posters that should/could/need to contest the removal claim or the site's operators?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5or can any user file a counter-claim? I'd like official legal info on thatb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Like I said, you'd almost certainly have to consult with a copyright lawyer to get a definitive statement on who can issue a counter notice (I don't think there's any such thing as "official legal info" but that's the closest you'll get). The DMCA is almost 20 years old and was not designed for sites like this where content is created by multiple users on each page. One possible reading of the law would require *all* users who contributed to issue a counter-notice, another would allow any user to file such a claim...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The degree to which they are liable for infringement caused by other users is also not obvious to a lay-person. In practice, there seems to be nothing *preventing* anyone from attempting to file a counter-notice, but whether those notices are serviceable, and whether that person will be liable if the courts do find the content to be infringing, is not at all clear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I meant I'm hoping we get an answer from one of the SE employees who have talked to the SE lawyer team.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a editor, what would be my claim? For example, https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/11519/revisions, the meat of the content that I "own" is basically the title which I can't say it's copyrighted.


















I'm really not happy about this.  Stack Exchange's hands are tied, and we're being forced to play along with the lawyers on this one.

I did look at the content that my name came up under, and I can't see why anyone would bother filing a claim on just words.

I digress; I didn't really come here to vent.  But two things struck me as annoying throughout this process.


Stack Exchange isn't in a position to counter the validity of these claims.  Does that imply that any non-infringing work is effectively stuck in the process until someone actually realizes they made a mistake?  More pressingly, do any other sites in the network have some kind of established precedent for dealing with scenarios like this?  It may comfort some of us to know how another network site handled it, and how successful they were at ameliorating the DMCA.
The process requires specific, pointed information (emphasis mine):


  
  your physical or electronic signature;
  your name, address, and phone number;
  identification of the material and its location before it was removed; a statement under penalty of perjury that the material was
  removed by mistake or misidentification;
  your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where you live (if you are in the U.S.), or your consent to the
  jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where your service
  provider is located (if you are not in the U.S.); and
  your consent to accept service of process from the party who submitted the takedown notice.
  


I use a pseudonym online for a reason, and I don't think it's particularly fair to demand (for this process) that I remove that.  This does raise the question, "is the pseudonym (and a burner phone number) okay to provide for the process", but I do feel like that would only further impact things.


It's just very discouraging, really. We do our best to keep the site free of pirated resources, and it doesn't seem like the industry really cares about our efforts.  Definitely not making me feel very good about the whole thing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, it's annoying and ridiculous that they'd come after us when Googling the title of any anime results in a giant list of pirated streams.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda That's one of the reasons I thought this request was sketchy. Nowhere in the claim did they in any way identify specific content that was being infringed. They just listed a bunch of titles of work and a list of links where those titles appeared. **But a title is trademarked, *not* copyrighted, and DMCA is not applicable to trademark violations and cannot be used for them.** In my personal opinion, this request smells horribly of DMCA abuse for something that DMCA is not meant to be used for, but I don't own any of the content and there's nothing I can personally do about it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@animuson:  If you could get someone to figure out what other sites did about this kind of thing, I think that'd be a good start.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're gonna work on that, @Makoto. Not gonna happen quickly, I'm afraid, but if we figure anything out we'll let y'all know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@animuson if you want a sketchy url, look at this one "http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/detective-conan\" Basically, they are claiming that a url that simply lists a bunch of question which are tagged with detective-conan is infringing their copyrights. If anything, that's a signal that the whole claim is bogus at best without an ounce of human oversight.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good luck fighting that stupid request. It is corporate trolling at its best. The company putting up those DMCA claims have a quota to meet. "See? We are protecting your content! See? We are necessary!". The only thing we can do is boycot anyplex if it makes any dent to them.


















I was watching an anime, and this really awesome piece of music came on. I want to know what it's called, but I don't know where to start looking. I know I can ask for help here on Anime.SE, but how should I do it? What information should I provide?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to ask a music identification questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related [What do we do about vague music ID requests?](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3936/1587)


















I'm glad you asked, person who is totally not me!

There are really only a few pieces of information that are essential when you're trying to have a piece of music from an anime identified. Namely:


The name of the anime. (Obviously.)
If you watched the anime dubbed (i.e. the dialogue was not in Japanese), indicate what language it was in.
A description of at least one time when the music you're looking for was played, meaning:


If it's something that has multiple episodes, the episode number.
A description in words of what is happening on-screen when the music plays.
If at all possible, you should provide a timestamp.
(That said, if you're looking for a song from, say, a movie you only saw in theaters, we understand that you can't reasonably come up with a timestamp for that.)



That's it! You can even fit it all into one sentence: "What is the song that plays 6 minutes into episode 134 of Naruto, at the beginning of Naruto's fight with Sasuke?" (I don't know anything about Naruto; this example is purely hypothetical.)



In some cases, additional information may help people find you an answer more quickly. For example:


If it's a vocal song, mention that. If you can tell what language it's in, mention that, too. (If you understand the lyrics, though, just go google them.)
Have you noticed that this song pretty much always plays when a character shows up on screen? Some songs are really easy to identify if you mention that it's so-and-so's motif.
Is the musical style distinctive, like a jazz piece in a soundtrack that's mostly electronic? That can definitely help people narrow it down faster.
If you can list off multiple instances where the song was played, that may be helpful.
If you're particularly enterprising, consider including a short extract (10-15 seconds, say) of the audio you're talking about - this way, someone who's familiar with the soundtrack might be able to answer your question right away! I personally like http://clyp.ithttp://clyp.it as a place to upload audio, but anything works, really.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, sometimes useful or even important: whether the music is from the original Japanese version, or any other dubs because we know that dubs tend to replace it with their [own](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/30192/who-is-the-artist-for-mistys-goodbye-song-during-the-flashback-at-gotta-catch) [song](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/40473/who-did-the-spinning-wheel-song-in-the-english-dub-of-the-garo-season-1-ova)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka A very good point! I always make the assumption that people are talking about the original Japanese version, but if someone is referring to some other version, it's very important to mention that. I added that to the list of "essential" pieces of information.


















I am pretty sure this has been coming and going on the web for a while, but I could not find a list of all the girls/elements.
https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIdLL.jpg
Some are easy to know. Some not so much.
The most obvious ones...

H - Suzumiya Haruhi (The melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi)
B - Belldandy (Ah! My Goddess)
N - Nagato Yuuuki (The melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi)
C - C2 (Code Geass)
As - Asuka Langley Soryu (Evangelion)
Ra - Ayanami Rei (Evangelion)
Cs - Kinomoto Sakura (Cardcaptor Sakura)

So at this point the people that made this linked the element to the series name instead of the character at some point...
Like

Db Bulma (Dragon Ball)

Or just part of it:

Rg - Misaka Mikoto (A certain scientific Railgun)

Or it makes no apparent sense:

Tl - Shirai Kuroko (A certain scientific Railgun)  Probably because of her power, Teleport??

So for some fun, post in the answers below what characters did you find, the series they came from, and what link from their name to the element symbol.
You don't need to nail all of them to answer. But do your best.

Ok so if you're not aware on https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/735/can-we-increase-the-maximum-tag-length/761#761Literature.SE's Meta there was a question posted about the age old problem regarding the 25 character limit to tags

Is there any way we can increase the maximum tag length to something bigger than 25 characters?
Right now, our site tags questions by book titles. Unfortunately, many book titles are longer than twenty-five characters. This has lead to some awkward abbreviations, such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zen-and-art-of-mc-maintzen-and-art-of-mc-maint
Is there any way to increase the maximum tag length?

as you can see it got https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed and https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/761/283this reply from Shog9 ♦

This can be increased, but only up to a maximum of 35 characters. This means https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenancezen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance is right out.
I increased the allowed length to 32, thus allowing https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zen-and-art-of-motorcycle-maintzen-and-art-of-motorcycle-maint, which should be a little bit easier to recognize. This sort of compromise is likely to be common... Thus, whenever possible, try to work the name of a publication into the title or first paragraph of a question.

however this change https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/735/can-we-increase-the-maximum-tag-length/761#comment2744_761isn't network wide

It's not network-wide, @Cahir; let's try it here for a little bit & make sure nothing breaks unexpectedly. The only other place this has been changed from the default is the Russian-language Stack Overflow, and there are a lot of other differences there too - so this is the first time it's been changed on an otherwise-standard English-language site. Also, 32 is a nice round number.

almost 2 years ago https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/259377/250962senshin pointed out Anime and Manga's problem with the 25 character limit and since Lit's character limit on tags have been increase https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12497/increase-tag-length-limit-to-32-or-35/12499#12499Arqade, https://movies.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2822/can-we-increase-the-tag-length-limitMovies and TV and https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11018/can-we-please-increase-our-tag-lengthSciFi has posted up their own requests to have their Tag Character Limited increased.
So i ask the question, Should we get the increase in the tag length limit aswell?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we get the increase in the tag length limit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have examples of tags which are abreviated because of the 25 character restriction?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ikaros looking through the top tags, [tag:fma-series], [tag:fma-brotherhood], [tag:ghost-in-the-shell-sac], [tag:chuunibyou], [tag:oregairu],  [tag:oreimo], [tag:konosuba], [tag:ano-hana], [tag:watamote], [tag:danmachi], [tag:danna-wakaranai-ken], [tag:ouran-hs-host-club]. That's from the first 5 pages only and I might have missed some, but some of them we might not want to change anyway (e.g. [ano-hana], though it should really be [anohana]) and others would exceed even 35 characters (e.g. [ore-no-imouto-ga-konna-ni-kawaii-wake-ga-nai] would be 44).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also "The girl who leapt through time", I think. The actual canonical tag might be using the Japanese title, but I vaguely recall that there was an issue with the length of the proposed English title tag synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon it seems the canonical tag is the English one. Usually if the work has a different Japanese and English name we prefer the English one and this matches that, but the Japanese name wouldn't need any abbreviation, and in other cases like that we've sometimes gone with the Japanese title. So increasing that limit might affect more than just the tags whose names we were forced to abbreviate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Thanks for the pointer; I guess the canonical form of the tag might have changed since I last looked at it. The tag still omits the "the" though, which makes it difficult to locate if users begin their tag search with the-girl and not "girl" (which I did at some point, since that was how the title of the work began), unless additional tag synonyms are made. (I think they were for this specific tag, but I'm on mobile and can't check easily.) I think the omission (and use of "thru" over "through") was because of character limits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Arqade just got an increase to 35 chars](https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12497/increase-tag-length-limit-to-32-or-35/12510#12510).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This change has now been made for all sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Welp, time to go on a tag-renaming spree.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@senshin: should we start flagging questions with tags that can be renamed (in the same way we flag questions with tags that need synonyms), or should we let things run their course first?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon If you see any tags that could use a rename, definitely do cast a custom flag on a question with that tag. (I've already looked through all tags with 2+ questions and updated many of them, though of course it's possible I glossed over some, and there's a ton of 1-question tags that I haven't looked at yet.)


















I was pointed to this thread via a comment to my question https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/40848/what-was-text-in-final-frame-of-magiWhat was text in final frame of Magi? . I agree that there are questions about the Japanese language which would add nothing to discussions of anime and/or manga. In the linked question, though, it concerns text overlayed into the image meant to be read by the audience, but was not translated. (I.e. it wasn't one of a dozen random shop signs the characters happen to walk by.) How can a question about it possibly be off topic?

If the text had been a separate layer, and could have been copied as text and pasted into Google Translate, perhaps I could understand why people might think I am too lazy to "do my own research". (Well, assuming Google Translate had half a clue in translating Japanese to English, anyway.) Even if there were a tool that could use OCR (optical character recognition) to pull Japanese text out of an image and translate it, the OCR would simply add another layer of potential error.

I guess the main thing I don't understand is why some are so quick to close. The question had been asked and answered before the first close vote was cast. The close-voters spend extra time on something they think should go away, and it will quickly fade away in any case. I spend extra time explaining myself on something which is transparently obvious. You spend extra time reading this post, thinking "Damn, another SE user b*tching. Why don't these guys just go away if they don't like it here?"

I don't have any overly defined thoughts on the general case though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm neutral to that question as well, but the main issue is one of whether or not we allow questions asking for blanket text translations like that.  I'm not going to say anything about your particular skill level with Japanese; it's probably almost on par with mine (minimal at best), but this is more along the lines of one needing to do a bit more legwork to solve this issue instead.  There are resources available online which talk at length about the Japanese character set (hiragana and katakana), and since that entire text body is in hiragana, its meaning wouldn't be too tough to derive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, I'd like it if you stuck around.  Having an issue with the site means you're using it, and you even *voiced* it here on our Meta.  Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto Heh. Don't worry. I've been with SO and various SEs for years and have no plans to move on. I try to maintain balance and a sense of humor about things. Just because I might disagree with something won't send me to Rage Quit City. I will usually attempt to explain my case, and if people don't agree so be it.


















I just made the (possibly not yet approved) tag [worldend] for the series WorldEnd: What Are You Doing at the End of the World? Will You Save Us? (aka Shūmatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii Desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu ka?). Even though it is commonly referred to as SukaSuka, I chose the main name based on my understanding that English is the preferred language for tags.

However, due to its prevalence, I request someone add the synonym [sukasuka].

there is 7,976 questions currently (24/06/2017 5:00 PM GMT+10) on Anime and Manga. this can be seen by going to the Questions link and looking under where Ask a Question link is (a bit to the left)

My question to the wannabe-moderators is the following :

This is basically the same question, so I'm not gonna post my version as a separate option.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5just curios, which are those issues or where can I read about them?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Pablo that's the point of the first half of my question "What are, in your opinion, the current issues our StackExchange is facing"


















How much do you know about the following series: Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Bleach, Dragon Ball?



The reason I ask is that these five franchises have the following characteristics:


They together make up about 25% of our total questions to-date and http://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/690993/35% of our total question views, so being able to moderate them is important.
Questions on these topics appear to be poorly-written more often than questions on other topics, which makes moderating them more important. (This is gut-feel; I don't have numbers. It might just be that I notice poorly-written questions on these topics disproportionately often.)
The sum total of my knowledge of these franchises is that I've played one of the Naruto fighting games, and hence I often have difficulty distinguishing between "a pile of utter garbage" and "a poorly-written but reasonable question". Our other moderators aren't as useless as me in this respect, but it never hurts to have more hands who know about these things.


Knowing about these series is by no means a requirement, of course. But if candidates A and B are identical except that A has an encyclopedic knowledge of Naruto while B has an encyclopedic knowledge of (say) Doraemon, I would vote for A.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have the same impression that posts about popular series are often poorly written compared to the site as a whole, but that's based on what I see in the review queue since I rarely look at them otherwise. Hence it is not exactly an unbiased sample.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i think we would also need moderators who know about new animes that pulled in as much crowds as the big 3 . Fairy tail is slotted to end within a couple of weeks. and to attract new crowds and answering there questions it would be helpful


















These questions annoy me, along with their spiritual cousin, the "When is Hunter x Hunter coming back?" / "When is Attack on Titan Season 2 airing" / "Is Mamotte Shugogetten getting a sequel?" question, but I don't know if they're a big enough problem to be worth banning.

Three major things annoy me about these questions:


They have expiration dates. If Mamotte Shugogetten resumes its dubbing schedule on October 17th, 20XX, then the question becomes useless noise for anyone reading after October 17th, 20XX. (Unless they're doing research to fill out a "Dubbing history of Mamotte Shugogetten" section on Wikipedia, I guess.)
They recur. If dubbing for Mamotte Shugogetten goes on hiatus again, someone is going to show up asking the exact same question: When is the dub for Mamotte Shugogetten going to start again? (Insert some series that people care about instead of Mamotte Shugogetten.) This new question is sort of a duplicate, but also sort of not, because we're talking about a new hiatus and a new resumption date for the same show. 
The only way to know if the question is answerable is to answer it. This is something that annoys me about the way we handle all newsy-type questions. I usually don't bother to review any of this sort of question because I have to do research equivalent to an answer to even know if the question should be closed or not, and it's easy to miss an announcement since some companies, especially US dubbing companies, make their release announcements weirdly hard to find.


Still, policy is policy, and even though these annoy me, I don't think they need to be stamped out yet. For now, I think we should treat them the same as other types of future event questions: close them unless there's an announcement or source that makes them answerable, and close ones that are asked during the same period as duplicates. 

As for the recurrence problem, even though it irritates me to have multiple versions of the same question scattered all over the site, it seems like it would get very confusing to try and close them all as duplicates of each other. As I understand it, we should vote to close a question as a duplicate of another if it is completely answered by the answers to the other question. But if someone asks "When will Mamotte Shugogetten resume dubbing?" in 2017, and then it resumes, and then it pauses again and someone asks "When will Mamotte Shugogetten resume dubbing?" in 2018, then the answers to the 2017 question do not actually answer the 2018 question, so it seems wrong to close the 2018 question as a duplicate. Of course, someone could come along and provide a new answer with the new date on the 2017 question, but then we have answers giving a date for the previous hiatus mixed with answers giving a date for the current hiatus, which makes the whole post confusing to read, especially since the default is to order the answers by votes.

So for now, I recommend the status quo.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*They have expiration dates* <- I totally agree with this point, especially regarding animes in a long run. A lot of questions about the progress of Naruto/One Piece/etc are no more relevant today even thought they used to be. In the same way, the "when will there be a Xth season" only makes sense as long as there is no new season out e.g the question "when will the second season of Attack on Titans come out?" doesn't mean anything anymore as it has already aired.



















  
  How much do you know about the following series: Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Bleach, Dragon Ball? 
  


Of the franchises listed:


I've watched nearly the entirety of Naruto and half of Shippuden, but have read the entire manga.
I've not pleasently experienced One Piece; the only versions I saw were the 4Kids dub way back when.
I've not watched or read Fairy Tail, but I am keen to look into it.
I'm very well versed in Bleach.  Of the "big three", this was the one I faithfully stuck with to completion.
My knowledge of Dragon Ball ends at around Z, but I know bits and pieces of the other series.


I would counter, however, that regardless of my knowledge levels of these series, it's still prudent for me to do the research on them anyway and look into what they're all about.  I don't personally feel that having an encyclopedic level of knowledge on these series is vital, but knowing what to look for in a high quality question is.

In that vein, there are heuristics I use to determine a good question even if I don't have experience with the series:


Can it realistically occur in the canon?  (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/40710/102Example.)
Does the question cite specific episodes or major plot points?  (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/17009/102Example.)
Is the question something that can be answered as a fan (myself), or by someone with some insight into the industry? (https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/38846/102Example.)


As this is a heuristic it is subject to flaws, but by and large I feel that I have a good eye for good questions.


  
  What are, in your opinion, the current issues our StackExchange is facing and how do you plan to address them if you were elected as a moderator?
  


We have a bit of an issue with diversity of questions.  As alluded to in an earlier question, we've got a serious focus on the major franchises (Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Fairy Tail, etc.), but not as much focus on the smaller or newer ones.  There are two issues at play here:  reach and personal watching habits.

The former is well out of our control; we can't dictate (very well, anyway) which series become the next Big Thing in Japan, so we would have to divert our attention to the latter.  This means that events like group watching sessions or chat discussions around new series would  be beneficial, as it'd get a guy like myself (who's very stuck in his "not interested in cute girls doing cute things series but OMG New Game does programming and I do too!  Wow!!"-ways) interested in other series.

That's a lot harder since I personally haven't been to any of those events held by us here - scheduling conflicts, mostly - and I don't know what measure of success they have.  But having more of these events more often and geared towards a wider diversity of genres would be beneficial.  Who knows; maybe doing that I'll actually watch Yuri on Ice or Free.  Maybe.


  
  One thing I have noticed is that most of our Mod Team do not appear in the main Chat Room, to the point that most can't being be @ pinged. While Chat is optional it does provide a platform to contact Mods and discuss policies/decisions as opposed to using custom flags or posting on Meta and it does make a Mod more approachable. As a Mod would you become more active/participate in Chat? if not how would you open yourself up to being contacted outside of flagging and Meta Posts?
  


The way my schedule and routine are structured prevent me from going to chat, but I am prepared to make adjustments which would mean I do go into chat.  I don't mind being reached for when needed, but I'd like to set up a system that works for me too.  Might fiddle with some notifications APIs to make it more convenient.


  
  We have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2682/1587a number of community events from annual events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2684/1587Conspiracy Santa to one off events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2692/1587EU A&M Meet up. Are there any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation on the site? Apart from the idea of events, are there any other ways you would encourage the community to grow and collaborate?
  


This is a lot tougher as we really look to find where we fit in the vast and broad community of Anime and Manga discussion places.  We've got our share of growing pains with what is and isn't acceptable on our site - notably the identification question issue among others - but that may stem from a deeper identity crisis.  We're quite happy and content with being what we are, which is a repository of knowledge for Anime and Manga, but to others, that seems to conflate to "forum", and we're simply not that.  An emphasis on growth would require clear and readily visible expectations to others as to what we're looking for.

I quite liked senshin's https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2305/april-2015-bounties-for-tags-sports-anime-2005-presentpast efforts to facilitate activity and encourage new content here, but ultimately that also meant that we'd have to want to contribute to that.  I would love an opportunity to bring something like that back, but instead of tying it to a theme or anything like that, I'd rather want to see some deeply insightful questions from other anime that are harder to answer.  I don't have the rep to facilitate something like that for very long, but I'd still like to see it.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Pull 'em aside and have a chat.  I'd want to see what's really going on behind those flags and figure out if it's a deeper issue than two users having a disagreement of some sort.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Moderators should act as a quorum, and we should respect the decisions of fellow moderators.  That said, I'd take them aside and ask them why they felt why they took the action they did.  Then I'd present my side and give reasons why I feel their actions weren't right.  I'm looking for consensus in the decision made, and possibly I would also learn a bit more into how they feel moderation is and should be done around here.


  
  What example can you point to, either here or on another site in the network, that is most indicative of your moderation style? How would you adapt it to fit for this site?
  


Of the posts on A&M:


https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3893/102I'm pretty happy with this one; it communicated my express opinion on what value a series tag holds here, since "the universe" is much broader in scope than "this instance", and "the universe" may not even have an equivalent "instance".  (I did notice that it was re-added afterwards, so I went back and corrected that.)
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2810/102This one is pretty good too.  I feel that a new tag for that subject would've been too broad and I communicated that clearly and respectfully.


Of the posts elsewhere:

I'm quite (in)famous on Stack Overflow nowadays - feel encouraged to https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1079354/makoto?tab=answerslook at my answers for more details, but of the posts here, I feel like these capture an applicable style for A&M best:


https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/291179/1079354What we do with non-native English speakers' posts; if it can be edited into shape, we should edit it into shape.
https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/302624/1079354Understanding the scope of an answer, and how "Not an Answer"-answers can be identified.
https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/351688/1079354Encouraging users to provide answers even if they're not innately familiar with the subject matter.  I feel like this is the thing we should be promoting a lot here, since not everyone really knows every anime.
https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/339127/1079354Editing advice; domain knowledge is not required to know that "I" should be capitalized.
https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/351433/1079354Encouraging the long-form answer; we're small (and I allude to as much in another answer in that post), and we don't draw lots of attention to long-form answers, but that doesn't mean we should stop doing them.



  
  In your opinion, what do moderators do?
  


As a high-rep user on another site, I've come to see moderators as folks that can handle the things that I can't handle.  That is, they handle the more intangible issues of the community, such as voting rings, users needing a timeout (potentially), and various parts of the community that no other user is privy to, such as warnings and suspensions, and even deleting comments.  Effectively, they clean up the mess that others can't quite clean up.  As we've still got beta-level privileges, my reputation here is near equivalent to that of a high-rep moderator-user on a fully-graduated site, so this means that there are a decent number of users here who still contribute to cleaning things up.  Moderators are there to help when the community can't quite accomplish it on their own, which I feel is a good role. 


  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


In the best cases, it reflects well on the community for having placed their confidence in my history.  In the worst case, it highlights that I, too, am human, and make human mistakes.


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  


This is hard to quantify on a smaller site, but the main issue(s) we would potentially have around here is content that can't be removed in a timely enough fashion, such as content which goes against the ToS of the site.  Also, moderators are the only kind of user who can remove comments, and removing offensive comments timely is something only a moderator can help with.

I actually think that's the Catch 22 we've been stuck in as a site for a while now. Like all SE sites, we are very clear and rigid about our expectations. (Visibility, eh. It's all out there, if you're looking for it.) But that's not what most anime fans online seem to expect or want out of a community, contrary to programmers or mathematicians or even sci-fi and fantasy fans, so we have a hard time growing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't help that anime fans tend to be young and non-native English speakers. A lot of them bristle under too many restrictions, even if you can get them to understand those restrictions and why they exist.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda: Yeah, I tend to agree with this.  As I was typing this answer up, it too occurred to me that this was the trap that we've fallen into.  We're a strange hodgepodge of community-but-not-interested-in-discussions-outside-of-chat which rubs some the wrong way.  It's like I was saying on the nomination page; regardless of how this shakes out, we've gotta start doing something to address this.  I've got a few ideas, but we'll need time and more cooperation from the people we already have to really make it work well.

  How much do you know about the following series: Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Bleach, Dragon Ball? 
  


Fairly knowledgeable. In case of Naruto and Bleach I have read the whole manga series, and have it physically available at home for review.
As for Fairy Tail, One Piece and Dragonball I follow the releases as they come. So consider me up to date.


  
  What are, in your opinion, the current issues our StackExchange is facing and how do you plan to address them if you were elected as a moderator?
  


There seems to be little variety in questions, and I think the very first question answered reflects that quite clearly.
This has been a thing for as long as I have been an active member, and I think this mainly caused by the type of people the community attracts. Which often just 'want to know/need help' with finding an serie/song
Figuring out a way to attract more dedicated fans would be my approach on fixing this particular issue.


  
  One thing I have noticed is that most of our Mod Team do not appear in the main Chat Room, to the point that most can't being be @ pinged. While Chat is optional it does provide a platform to contact Mods and discuss policies/decisions as opposed to using custom flags or posting on Meta and it does make a Mod more approachable. As a Mod would you become more active/participate in Chat? if not how would you open yourself up to being contacted outside of flagging and Meta Posts?
  


Personally, I am also not an active chat user on A&M. However, when becoming a Mod I will attempt to be so more. 
Besides that I actually am available on a lot of other chat services such as skype and discord, As I prefer to work with desktop clients for chatting.
These clients also offer mobile support, which makes me available nearly 24/7 on these mediums, and always up for a chat.


  
  We have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2682/1587a number of community events from annual events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2684/1587Conspiracy Santa to one off events like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2692/1587EU A&M Meet up. Are there any other Events you would like to see occur to help bolster community cohesion, attract more users to the site and/or increase activity and participation on the site? Apart from the idea of events, are there any other ways you would encourage the community to grow and collaborate?
  


I have been part of some of these events and would extend a helping hand if community members decide to create new events. However, I wouldn't currently have any suggestions for said events.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Would be dependant on the type of flags, however assuming that it's just to chatty/ extended discussions 
would redirect the users to chat, to continue their discussion there instead as comments are not for extended discussions, and point this fact out to them.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Discuss it with the the said mod. See if you can reach some sort of mutual consensus, or if it escalates beyond that, included other moderators or some cases the community it self as well.


  
  What example can you point to, either here or on another site in the network, that is most indicative of your moderation style? How would you adapt it to fit for this site?
  


I guess I would point out https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2660/1458https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2660/1458 , moderation can be hard, especially considering borderline materials. 
So by helping define limits, both as a moderator assisted by the members of the community we can keep a nice and safe place.

And if people need clarifications, help, or an explanation. https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2655/1458https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2655/1458 Ill give it to them


  
  In your opinion, what do moderators do?
  


They mediate, maintain, answer and respond to the community, there where the user driven moderation is insufficient.


  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


Not that different. People will see that they can reach out to me if they need help or have questions. Besides that, I am still a community member.


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  


Yes, I think it make it easier for people to reach out to me if they need anything.

We seem to have plenty of dedicated fans of the five series mentioned in the first question, so to produce a change would require attracting dedicated fans of the wider medium. I'm curious if you have any concrete ideas to accomplish this. I see good writing about anime on personal blogs, but none of those people seem interested in joining a community, and I've come to believe after participating on Literature that SE just isn't well structured for certain kinds of writing about media.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda As I feel my answer would very roughly exceed the character limit ill try to condense it a bit, so sorry if anything is lost in this process. There is a huge difference between Q&A style, and blog style of answering questions. Where blogging allows for a far wider view. Where as on A&M you will have to condense data, which would be less attractive to said people. So like you mentioned, it's not structured for writing about media. However, to attract said people to A&M, would could find a common ground for them where they can express themselves both ways without much additional effortb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The key challenge being, the common ground. Which could be, a summarization of their answer, and more publicity/readers of their publications. Without losing data in the process on the answer, but also attracting people to read on in the blog. However, if it where that easy, it would probably happen a lot more than it does already. So I guess finding a more pro-active way to do so would bring the solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your thoughts on the issue. I guess what I was really getting at is that a lot of the most interesting questions about media in general, including anime and manga, are questions that you wouldn't think to ask unless you were already working on an answer, and don't gain anything from the rigid question / response format of an SE site. I think you're right that finding a way for people who are interested in these topics to be able to write about them in some form within the restrictions of SE could be a way forward.


















Do live actions based in anime belongs to Anime SE or they are for another SE community? If so, which would it would be Sci Fi and Fantasy SE? Movies SE?

I dont know if that is content which overlaps with Anime SE, or it is just better fit in there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's definitely some overlap.  I think it can find a home in both places, but I'll want to write something more formal up when I can get a bit more quiet time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This was marked as a duplicate of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/13, but my understanding is that was superseded by https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/415, which would suggest that such questions about live-action adaptations of anime/manga would be allowed. However very few such questions have been asked, and most of them are about comparing the live-action adaptation to the original work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I wanted to ask (that I already did in Sci Fi SE and got the answer so no point reposting it here I guess) it was this question . https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/164075/how-many-times-has-the-in-production-robotech-live-action-movie-changed-director . Here there is also a rule against asking about "production details" or something like that, so it still dubious if that question was allowed here. And for that old question about expanding scope of questions, Anime has as much fans as Sci Fi in real world or more. There must be a reason why Sci Fi SE has more users than Anime SEb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... I have 2 theories why Sci Fi SE has much more users than Anime SE. 1) Sci Fi is more "mature" and since the showcase of both communities is stackoverflow.com with old mature  people with a lot of culture they tend to go more to Sci Fi (I have serious doubts Sci Fi and Fantasy content in general is more mature than Anime so dont quote me on this theory) and theory 2) Anime SE is too restrictive in its questions .


















The way we approach "Where can I watch?" questions has bothered me for a while. Usually, we easily get five people to vote to close every one of these questions as "requesting illegal or copyrighted materials", but not one person who bothers to edit the word "legally" into the title, even though that's typically all that's needed to make the question on-topic. 

I would even argue that in most cases the question doesn't need to explicitly ask for a legal source, as long as it doesn't explicitly ask for an illegal source. But when I've made such edits, I usually make it look like "Where Can I Legally Watch Legal Copies of Legal  Legally, Legally Only, Must be Legal (legally only)?" since some people seem deeply disturbed by the absence of that word.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/41469/7579Where can I legally watch the legal dubbed version of "Kimi no na wa" ("Your Name") (legally only)? is the most recent example, that spurred me to say something. In its original form, that question did not explicitly ask for a free or illegal source. It did ask for a download, which we might infer means illegal, but all someone had to do was edit that out and maybe change the title to specify "legally". Instead, we had five people vote to close, and now it's sat closed for five days, and no one could be bothered to take the thirty seconds to edit.

I don't love "where can I watch" questions, but they're one of the few question categories on this site that helps a lot of people solve a practical problem they're facing. And in 99% of cases, all you really need to do is edit them so they're asking for legal sources. I'm not even sure what kind of post would fall in that remaining 1%; maybe if the OP keeps on rolling back edits, that would be a case for closing the question and re-asking it. Answers that provide illegal sources should of course be nuked immediately, but that doesn't make the question itself off-topic.

I get it: here on A&M we've got lots of posts that are impossible to salvage through editing, either because the OP's writing skills are so poor that you can't make heads or tails of what they're saying, or because they didn't include any detail, so fixing the answer would basically be equivalent to writing your own answer, but with all the gains going some rando who couldn't be bothered to put in any effort. I get that that's what we mostly review around here. But everyone, please try to be more aware when a tiny edit can completely fix a question, and don't immediately reach for the close vote button.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we stop immediately closing "Where can I watch" questions as "Requesting illegal copyrighted materials"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5related: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/795/should-questions-asking-for-translated-anime-manga-without-specification-be-clos. Sadly it seems my suggestion there is rarely followed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM Yeah, you also pointed out in your answer that if we edit the question to ask for legal sources, it doesn't really matter if the OP only wanted illegal sources because other people might have the same question but be willing to accept legal sources, which I agree with.


















Additional questions from me.

Assuming OP wants a list of legal sources, will this turn into a "shopping advice" type of question which is generally disliked on other SE sites? Will it eventually lead to basically every popular title having a "where can I legally watch it today" and a lot of the links becoming obsolete over the years as licenses end and the item is removed from streaming sites, and discs are removed from shop listings?

Assuming OP wants an illegal source and we turn the question into asking about legal sources, and then OP becomes disinterested (and comments about it, and maybe tries to delete their question), what use is it to anyone on the site? Are you okay with putting effort into answering a question the OP didn't ask?

I also don't like that we don't try as we should to salvage potentially useful questions generally, but in this case I have to ask myself and other editors: do we want to put effort into something that isn't hard to find answers to by googling "watch|stream [anime title]"?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The first question is more about whether we should allow these questions at all, which is a separate discussion. The fact is we have been allowing them, but we've been closing them all unless someone spams "legally" all over the question, which I find obnoxioius.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the second point, perhaps if the OP is asking where they can watch _Mamotte Shugogetten_ and will only accept illegal sources, then editing the question makes it useless to everyone, but for a popular title like _Kimi no Na Wa_ I'm assuming there will be other people who have the same question. Under that assumption, the effort put into answering the question will help someone, even if it's not the OP.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As far as your last point, if it were a lot of effort, I might agree, but editing these questions is a very small amount of effort, and the moderation load on this site was hugely lightened by removing id requests. We also don't really get that many of these questions. FWIW, I'm also confused that people don't just Google "Mamotte Shugogetten streaming" when they want to watch something, but I don't think supporting those questions is a huge deal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda regarding your last comment, SE had a close reason like "this question can be easily answered with a simple search query" which might be applicable to a lot of those questions (assuming legal, of course). If it's an obscure anime which isn't being streamed or sold on discs everywhere, then I guess we could answer it. In any case, I don't see any harm (right now) in answering with amazon links, but it may turn into a problem in a year or two.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That sounds reasonable. Since everyone's response seemed to be like "WTF, we allow those?" it seems like we should have a larger discussion at some point about whether to stop accepting them.


















I think Hakase's point here is a strong one:


  ...[I]n this case I have to ask myself and other editors: do we want to put effort into something that isn't hard to find answers to by googling "watch|stream [anime title]"?


...so the TL;DR of my answer here will be:

Are these the kinds of questions we really want to answer?

I make as much reference to this struggle https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4076/102in an earlier post asking about release dates for dubs.  But I suppose that we should take a step back here.

Let me be clear, in terms of procedure that is what should've happened - we should edit out the references to any requests for illegal sources - and it's regrettable I didn't take the time to do that, but I have a rationale for it which has been weighing on my mind for a bit.

The anime fanbase is pretty well pigeonholed.  We've got a lot of forums and discussion boards dedicated to anime of all kinds and subjects, and quite frankly, asking where to find these sources is a question that comes up very common.  Enter A&M; if someone were to ask the same question here and expect an equivalent reception to it, and then get slapped with, "oh no, we don't do that here", then chances are they're not going to get what they want from us, and they just up and leave.

To tie that back to this question, it was asked and phrased the way it was because the user either didn't know or didn't care of any legal sources, and there's little that our words can do to sway them of either notion.  Further, any information we could provide would regurgitate a well-timed and thought out Google search.

It seems I made that mistake again in answering this question; it's something that can be found on the Internet, but it isn't particularly insightful or interesting.  An idle moment while taking a breather at work allowed me to look things up and get an answer in while referencing legal sources, but...again, that's still a Google search that we should encourage others to be doing.

I personally don't feel like we should be answering these questions. 
 Providing a resource to users looking for specific shows through legal channels and avenues - and more importantly, a resource we don't have to maintain - would be the more ideal approach.

We actually https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/922/102have a list of legal sites available; it suffers from an acute lack of visibility.  If we were to make this kind of resource more prominent, we'd likely get more users looking things up for themselves in that regard.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Again, most of this answer is about whether we should or should not take these questions at all, which is a separate discussion. I have no complaints about your conduct on that _Kimi no Na Wa_ question; you provided an answer with what legal sources you could find instead of jumping to close the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As to the issue of whether that user, or any specific user, was asking for a legal source or not, I actually don't care; we're not going to start allowing questions looking for illegal sources, so they'll either get legal sources or they'll get nothing, and that will have to be good enough for them. I suspect a lot of these people are outside the US and Western Europe, and can't access or afford legal sources anyway, but there are still cases where the question could be useful to someone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda:  Fair point.  I do admit that this was a bit of a sidebar, but I still think it's relative to keep in the back of our minds.  Perhaps I'll start up a separate question asking what we really want to focus on as a community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please do. If your and Hakase's immediate reaction to this was "Wait, we allow those questions? Seriously?", that seems like a conversation the community should have again. I have my arguments for and against keeping them, but if we do have them I don't think it serves anyone's interest to immediately close them all like we've been doing.


















Personally I don't think we should want these kind of questions, not even if they state legal. Mainly due to the broad variety of the term legal in different countries.

We have a list of generally accepted legal source https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/922/how-can-i-tell-if-a-site-is-legalHow can I tell if a site is Legal?. Which is a very good source to refer to, if somebody wants to stream anime or manga online. 

We also have a fairly nice list of resources if you want to download for offline usage https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/25959/apps-for-offline-manga-reading/25961#25961Apps for offline manga reading

Now we get to the dubious part

Switzerland, Spain: Downloading copyrighted content for personal use is perfectly legal. You cannot distribute the content or use it to make profit though.

Canada, Mexico and Netherlands: Known to tolerate downloading copyrighted contents for personal use.

So this would mean the sites that distribute said content are still illegal right, case closed?

Frankly no, or at least not always. 

In Spain, file sharing and torrenting of copyrighted content for private use has been repeatedly declared legal by the courts multiple times.

There have also been cases where distribution for private use was allowed, if the original distributor at the very least owned a copy. 

Take note that private use covers both online and offline usage of said resource.

Great, so any source can be legal. So lets only support franchised (paid for) alternatives. This way we support the creator, and we know it's legal for sure for everybody

Leaving the fact most people that ask these questions won't be to happy with that, that sounds like a solid plan! 

This does however come with one more flaw, fan dubs/subs. Which are glorious legal gray zones, as they most often can fall under either

A: Fair use

Fair use is a doctrine in United States copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders, such as for commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching or scholarship., however, similar laws exist in other countries as well.

Or B: educational purposes

Activities that are integral, immediate, and proximate to the education of students, or in the case of libraries, integral, immediate, and proximate to the provision of library services to library patrons, qualify as "educational purposes."

Both of which may or may not be always legal.

So, to actually answer your question. No, I would rather close a question than just add the word 'legal' to it. As it carries closely to no meaning or difference, as opposed to without it. 

Yes I would accept a re-open at this point in time if the OP himself takes the effort to add legal to the question at this point in time, like i did here. https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/41469/7579Where can I legally watch the dubbed version of "Kimi no na wa" ("Your Name")? 

And to be frank, I think all such questions should be closed as off topic. We can't properly tell legal sources apart for each individual user. However, when we close it, we can link them our resources of generally accepted legal sources to at least push them in the right way.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is again a separate discussion. It was previously decided to allow these questions. If you want to argue that they should be banned, please make a new question where we can discuss that.


















I'd like to propose to not add the word "legally" into these questions anymore to "make them ask about where to get it legally". Let's just assume we're only interested in legal sources because that's how things actually are. There's no need to assume everybody is a filthy pirate if the word "legally" isn't present. We just delete illegal requests fast anyways.

So, no more "legally".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I definitely agree with this. As long as they don't explicitly ask for illegal sources, we should give them the benefit of the doubt. Even asking for "free" sources doesn't necessarily mean they want an illegal source as there are legal free sources like Crunchyroll. IMO it's answers giving illegal sources that we should bring the hammer down on right away.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion, the real reason to add "legal" is not to force this onto the OP, but to try to limit the inevitable, undesirable "It's on [streamanimefree.com](http://www.example.com/)" type answers. In practice I don't know how effective this is. A moderator notice could serve the same purpose without being so intrusive but needs to be approved by SE, or protecting the question would drastically reduce such answers (though protecting every such question is fairly heavy-handed).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5we might want to implement a filter which doesn't allow users to post links to sites which are 99% of the time used to share pirated episodes or chapters with a red popup explaining it to noobs so they would understand that their answer will be deleted quickly if they try to obfuscate the urlb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are way too many such sites to keep a list updated, let alone one that SE will use internally for the code. New anime/manga piracy sites seem spring up almost daily. For the number of answers of this type that get posted, it just isn't worthwhile.


















I'm certain at some point I had recommended that we migrate that resources over to the main site...I can't seem to find the post, but no bother.

My stance on this issue is fairly simple:  we shouldn't allow these kinds of questions.

It's easier for us to maintain the one list of legal resources, and keep that fairly locked down (i.e. protected and watch it like a hawk) to mitigate the damage of others coming in and adding their own illicit sources than it is for us to look for a single specific series.

Note that this has the unfortunate side-effect of locking out series which have gone long out of print, or are otherwise not available through legal channels.  Even with that in mind, I don't want us to be in the business of maintaining a resource dedicated to those series if I can help it.

This will also have a knock-on effect on how many people come to the site, since they're not going to get an answer that will satisfy them, but I have other ideas on how to solve that...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My own opinion is that it's not on topic (or on brand) of our site to actively maintain a list of legal sources for… anything! So what we should do is add a simple "how to google" guide into that list of ours, migrate it to main site and close all new such questions as a duplicate to it. This is the kind of question that the seekers should find answer to on their own, as it's impossible to keep up with every title's legal watching/reading options.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Would suggest migrate to main, and lock it. It doesn't get updated all that often, and as you also stated, neither do we really want to maintain it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx I support that ideab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx just to clarify, if we are going to lock it, what should we do if we find dead links? Or if we find more legal links? Do we just leave it as is or do we need to unlock it, edit it and then lock it again?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Darjeeling I would say leave it locked. Possibly a historical lock would fit it best even. As the question is currently set up, and answered, it is not really fit for the main site, but fits flawless in meta. Leaving it open would be a good incentive for new people to ask similar questions which we are trying to avoid with this proposal to begin with.

This is a https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3949/should-we-delete-the-remaining-id-questions-to-possibly-reduce-the-number-of-stisecond time I'm asking this question. Previously I asked it 9 months ago, but with how much time passed and the public opinion has had enough time to change, I thought I'd give it another go.

If you're active on the main site, you might have noticed that we've taken the task of deleting every incoming ID request and that it's like a 1/3 of all questions that we get.

See https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3959/191Logan's answer for a list of possible actions. But to summarize, the main 2 options are:


It's not that big a deal, let's not do anything about it;
Delete all remaining locked IDs and hope Google ranks us way down on "identify anime" search results;


There are no guarantees that search engines will actually hide our site from those seeking to identify anime. But if it's that big a deal, we could try.

Are you annoyed enough by the still never-ending ID requests which we regularly delete? Is it not such a big deal? Let's discuss.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we want to delete all historical IDs so that maybe we'd get less IDs from new users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps shockingly, I am slightly inclined towards keeping them. It is not a large imposition to close and delete new id-requests as they come in, and they now do provide a very small benefit in that they keep some tags alive, which could be useful to future low-rep users wanting to ask legitimate questions about them.


















As per what https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4094/1587Makoto had already said we don't see so many ID Requests anymore. 

However i would be against wiping out the remainder of the questions. the reason is because when we chose to get rid of most of them as apart of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3839/1587Phase 3 of the phase out some people did loose reputation on the questions/answers that got deleted because of the questions and answers not meeting the requirements


  Please delete all "identification-requests" without a question score of 4 or higher AND at least an answer with a score of 3 or higher.


now while the "complaints" in the chat room i had saw about rep loss because of this may have been just joking about i would think some users may have taking it about more personally (after all, some people can really get hot and bothered when they loose rep [INSERT COMPLAINT SO.META QUESTION ON DOWNVOTING]).

if we delete these people could be loosing more rep than what they may have lost the first time. this can also add insult to injury after a bunch of questions/answers were removed by https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4050/1587a DMCA Request. also it would be kinda unfair for those who put in the effort to post well received questions/answers only to loose the rep from them now just because a bunch of zero effort users ignored, and continue to ignore all the sign posts we stuck up. also no one can claim to have an https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2496/1587unobtainable tag badge

In regards to the concern about Google Ranking Anime and Manga higher up in "identify anime" or "what anime is this" i don't get Anime and Manga.SE on the first page. i would think that anyone who is putting in the time to check out more than the first Google Results Page will learn that id requests are off-topic here before posting. 

if users are landing on one of the locked questions they should see the in use https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request tag, assume we allow them and try to use it only to get the message that it's black listed with the links back to Meta, if they still post their id request after this then they would have posted it anyway regardless of what we do (save some regex that 100% correctly ids an id request about to be posted and throws a fist out of the screen hitting the user and yells "READ THE RULES!")

it is also my opinion that just like "what anime?" comments, because we are Anime and Manga related we will always get people who see random images or remember plots from when they were young and what to know the source. what stops us getting pointless "what anime?" comments is series tags and the rep requirement for comments.


  If you're active on the main site, you might have noticed that we've taken the task of deleting every incoming ID request and that it's like a 1/3 of all questions that we get.


while i can't say i am as active as some (ie. wasn't on at all for most of yesterday) the trickle of id requests i see isn't all that much, maybe 1 every few days? if these are a third of our new questions then this might speak to a bigger problem of us not getting enough questions to reduce this 1/3 to be like 1/5.



DISCLAIMER: i too would loose rep if all remaining id requests were deleted however i stand to only loose https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22689/is-this-a-shonen-jump-anime22 rep which is chump change to me so i wouldn't be torn up loosing it

I just used a large fraction to underline that it's a pretty big percentage of what we see, and it's not something completely unnoticeable.


















This question is predicated on a false premise, namely that we are still getting identification requests because we have strong SEO specifically for questions asking for anime/manga identification. That is a misunderstanding of how SEO works on SE sites.

By far the most crucial aspect of SEO is the presence of tags. Popular tags give keywords which are present on the questions they are tagged. Tagged questions link to the tag pages, which link back to all the questions with the tag. Google looks at the internal structure of the site and determines what the big topics are. For us, until early 2016, identification requests was one of the big topics.

None of that is happening with identification requests, which is ultimately the reason why we removed https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request in the first place. The tag barely even exists at this point, and there is no risk of it growing (in fact, as time passes it will shrink relative to the site as a whole). Google also updates regularly enough that we can't reasonably blame any form of caching. Individual posts in random tags will not have any big effect on SEO just from their titles. Indeed, I tried a few representative searches for things like "What is this anime?" or "Anime identification" and I never saw this site on the first page of results, except this single question once near the bottom of the first page of one search: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618Where is this picture from? How do I use Reverse Image Search to find the source of an anime/manga image?. If you want to propose doing something specific with that question, such as locking or deleting it, I think that deserves a separate meta post, as it isn't really an identification question at all.

So if we aren't optimized specifically for identification questions, why do they keep showing up? The answer is simpler than you think. It's because that's still a common type question people on the internet as a whole want to ask about anime/manga. We're no longer targeting identification questions specifically, but we are still targeting people who want to ask questions about anime/manga generally. And a lot of those questions are identification questions. Like it or not, that fact should be obvious to anyone who was on the site when they were allowed. Even if we remove every reference to identification questions from the site, the rate of incoming identification questions might drop 10%, but it would not drop to 0. Even in the early days of the site, when we had barely any external traffic, identification questions occasionally showed up, and not because of any SEO-related phenomena (the tag then, as now, was not one of the top ones); they will continue to appear occasionally as long as this site exists and regardless of anything we try to do to preempt them.



So what can we do? We could try to kill all SEO for anime/manga questions in general. Which would basically amount to deleting the site, as far as search engines are concerned. Obviously we aren't ever going to seriously consider this, but it's the only way to completely eliminate incoming identification questions.

We could remove https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-requestidentification-request from the 27 remaining questions that use it. However I suspect at this point the tag (which is not even in the top 50 tags on the tag page) is doing more good than harm, by announcing that identification questions are no longer permitted and giving an error message when users try to use this. I suspect this is why, concurrent to the overall drop-off in identification questions, we have seen them become low quality spammy questions: the askers who wanted to ask serious high quality identification questions and put work into asking well tend to see this and withhold their questions, leaving only the ones who are not willing to put much effort in. Almost anything we do to reach them and preempt them from asking is likely to be in vain for that reason.

We could change the titles of the remaining identification questions to be less obviously identification-related. Like I said above, I suspect this would only affect things at the 10% level or so, not completely eliminating the remaining trickle of identification questions. I'd be open to suggestions in this direction, but personally I don't understand the details of SEO enough to know what kinds of changes would affect the situation, and it seems equally possible to make the situation better or worse with a move like this, so I don't think it makes much sense. 



Or we can keep doing what we're doing. It's not a big deal at all that occasionally someone asks a question that we don't take and we have to click a few buttons to close it and remove it. The questions are removed quickly and there's no lingering effect, so basically no harm done to the site. Unless you spend a lot of time in the chat room or review queues, you'd never even see 90% of them. It's by far the easiest moderation we ever have to do on the site. If annoyance over needing to moderate identification questions is the main motivation here, the only way way we ever could have avoided that was to not ban the questions (or even restrict them); deciding to ban identification requests was exactly a decision to moderate the new ones that show up. The community decided that the effect the questions were having was worth the extra sustained moderation effort to remove them, and so we just have to keep removing them.

Of course, we also should not forget the negative effects of removing hundreds of well-written, answered questions from the site as well. Some of the information in the identification requests we've closed is not available in any form anywhere else. Some of it is linked to from this site or externally and some have thousands or even tens of thousands of views. Most of the questions that remain are well written and solidly answered (contrasted to the reason we banned the type of question, because a lot of them were poorly written and fundamentally unanswerable). The fact that we no longer accept more questions of this type does not mean that we should destroy good content that they contributed when it was allowed, nor is it a license to ignore that content.

Additionally, removing such posts would delete most of the tags that were newly created based on the resolution of the previous request, harming the overall accessibility of the site (and wasting many hours of senshin's time). Based on https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/668009this query that's over 200 tags, which is quite a large number, over 10% of all the tags on the site if I counted correctly. In my mind, accessibility is one of our greatest issues, especially as SE has provided next-to no technical support to make it easy for new users on sites like ours to ask questions that may not yet have appropriate tags despite acknowledging this problem years ago. Deleting all those tags again just because we still have a (completely expected and predictable) incoming trickle of identification questions seems like a huge overreaction.

When identification were allowed, many people were working very hard to improve those questions and answer them, and the ones that are still around (and historically locked) represent the best of that effort. Now that they're disallowed, I think having to click 4 or 5 times, taking 10-20 seconds apiece, to close vote such a question a couple times a week (reading the question is barely even required, and the close notice is clear enough that commenting isn't necessary) doesn't even register as a real problem, and certainly not one that we ought to be removing hundreds of old posts over.



In any case, if the real worry is that a sizable fraction of the incoming questions are identification questions, I think it is ultimately more productive to ask what we can do to improve the existing allowed questions and attract more questions (including asking more ourselves). The overall quality of the site as a reference has nothing to do with what fraction of incoming questions get deleted immediately; it has to do with the quality and quantity of good questions and answers that stick around. We should think more about what we can do to increase those numbers (especially since the raw question/day numbers have dropped dramatically due to the removal of identification requests as well as some very popular series ending) and less about the occasional bad questions that take 10 seconds to deal with.

I'd edit the latter to remove "identify anime", but it's locked (or probably not worthy to edit). **Googling "identify manga", "anime identification" or "manga identification" is dangerous though**; it returned [newest identification-request questions](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identification-request).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... but I agree that it won't make any difference. People will just post identification-request anyway because they don't bother to read.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka I can't reproduce those search results. Are you doing the search in a private browsing window? If not, Google will customize your results based on previous searches and other data, so if you visit this site regularly you're likely to have biased results toward this site. Even if you are in private browsing mode, some location data will still be used, meaning search results can still be inconsistent depending on who does the search.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In any event, the first text one is likely to read on the tag page is "IDENTIFICATION REQUESTS ARE NOW OFF-TOPIC, AND THIS TAG HAS BEEN BLACKLISTED". People may skip that or see it and post anyway, but there's little we can do about that, and it's likely any such users would cause the same problems no matter how they end up here.


















In my opinion, we shouldn't artificially inflate the "questions asked per day" stat by asking questions which nobody has asked before due to how simple/obvious the answer is. That would seriously bring down the site's quality and turn it into [something bad for very unintelligent people]. If a question needs to be asked, it will be asked naturally by others.

It's true that some of the more active series have ended for which people could have had questions, so I don't think it's unusual to see fewer questions these days. IMO it's just how it is and the site works perfectly fine in this regard. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If all you mean by "don't artificially inflate the questions stat" is "don't ask stupid questions", then I agree. But coming up with good questions about anime, or any kind of media, requires thoughtfulness. I've never had a question just burst out of me by some natural genesis; they always came because I was thinking a lot about a series and it occurred to me to wonder something non-obvious. That's something we could encourage people to do. That's something we could even write a tutorial on how to do, the way we've done on Literature to encourage people to think more deeply about books.


















I had intended to write something up a week after the mod election, but then life happened.  That's how life goes, but...

For those of us actively following the seasons, we could author questions that ask about plot holes with the series.  Many of these can't just be figured out by watching the show (namely, a few of them in Alice and Zoroku), so I feel like questions like this would be beneficial.

However...I find myself largely agreeing with Hakase's point.  Artificially inflating the questions asked count isn't going to accomplish anything.  However, if we ask meaningful and impactful questions about current series (or even a few classics), then it wouldn't be artificial.

I want to stress, in an Anime/Manga ecosystem where most sites allow discussion, opinion, and conjecture on the front pages, we come across as very weird in that we only want verifiable facts or educated guesses at all, and there's no room for chit-chat.  We're not going to attract the vast majority of casual participants here just by existing; we may have to look at what it took for other sites to sustain a following, like Movies and TV.

I still get the impression that we're looking for what suits our style best.  We're a Q&A site that wants good questions and great answers.  It'd be valuable to add more great answers (analogous to Aki Tanaka's proposal), but I think to get the ball rolling, we need to ask good questions, too.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that this site has yet to really find a place in the online anime community since what we have to offer isn't what most anime fans are looking for. After spending a little time on other anime sites and other media-based SE sites, I've begun to wonder if there really is an audience out there for this site much beyond our current users. The type of person the fandom attracts is very different from minutia-loving sci-fi and fantasy fans, for whom the SE format works well. Most online anime fans want something less rigid, where they can discuss and chit-chat and speculate and fanfic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It just may be so that we've collected all the questions that have popped into people's head for most of the well known and popular series to this day. If more sophisticated works become popular, and people start having trouble finding answers, new questions will get posted. It feels unusual but I think it's a sign that this site is just that good at doing what it's intended to do − collect all the questions which were important enough to ask, nothing more, nothing less.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase:  While in principle I largely agree with you, I would personally not consider a question which asked what this song from this episode of this series as "important".   Further, I do think that we're thinking of the audience(s) we want to attract, since we're running a bit dry on new blood (and some of the old timers aren't as active either).

There appears to be no way to edit a tag, at least with my level of privilege. The other day I wrote a tag (which was soon approved), and today I noticed an error.  Could someone either tell me how I could suggest an edit to it, or edit it for me?  The tag is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tsuki-ga-kireitsuki-ga-kirei.

it ends with


  being third-years in middle school [eighth grade].


it should say


  being third-years in middle school [ninth graders in American English].


The main reason is to correct an error of fact, but the other words, and shift from grade to graders, is to improve context and match agreement between preceding and bracketed text.

When the tag character limit was increased recently, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4060/should-we-get-the-increase-in-the-tag-length-limit#comment8263_4060I asked if we should flag questions with tags that could now be better names and was given a green light. This works well for the vast majority of questions, but I've noticed a number of locked identification requests that I can't flag, https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/193365/261498since they are historically locked:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/in-clothes-called-fatin-clothes-called-fat: the localised title is In the Clothes Called Fat.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jeanie-light-brown-hairjeanie-light-brown-hair: full title is Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair


There may be some others; these were the most obvious ones to me when I was looking at my own tags and the list of those that had been created with the retagging effort.

Now that SE has expanded the character limit for tags, we can review past tags and normalize them in some way.

Currently, our how we use tags and how we keep them up to date lags behind some of the other recreational SE community. We should look at doing small improvements to promote collaboration. 

I would like to propose the following initiatives:


Change abbreviations for abbreviated tags, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ouran-hs-host-clubouran-hs-host-club to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ouran-high-school-host-clubouran-high-school-host-club. We can use the official abbreviations for overly long LN names and adaptations of them. 
Change and keep track all romanized japanese titles to their official english equivalents (where applicable)  in a community wiki meta post
Promote and create a consistent site-specific standard for tag wikis and excerpts. We don't get much use out of tag wikis, but we really should take advantage of them. We have so-called franchise meta tags for series, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/full-metal-alchemist-seriesfull-metal-alchemist-series, but it's not clear to many new users of how to use these tags and what to use these tags with (e.g.,"music" id requests with in a series need the series tag). This way we can refer new users to the wiki for an explanation than have to explain it from scratch. 
Create a bounty system for creating original tag wikis. Funded in part by me and any others that want to contribute. Bounty rewards will be be awarded based on efforts made with potential bounty rewards of between 100 and 1000 rep. 
Any other tag related changes that the community wishes to implement.

Award bounties to answers a user may have in the past for completing the country. However the theme will be a bit different.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: tag wikis - as a historical note, I tried standardizing these [about 3 years ago](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/937/) and basically succeeded because I had _far_ too much time on my hands at the time and went through and edited all the tag wikis myself. Of course, I didn't keep up with new tags as they were created (nor do I plan to, going forward), so our tag wikis are in a state of disrepair by now. For this to work well, it will require the community at-large to invest time into maintaining the tag wikis.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However... I no longer believe tag wikis are worth maintaining for most series tags (which are 90%+ of our tags by number if not by question count). With the exception of certain slightly confusing tags (multiverses like _Fate_, _FMA_, etc and similar cases like _Railgun_ vs _Index_) where we actually can provide useful guidance about tag use on this site, I don't think there is really much value we can add that goes above and beyond what someone can find by googling the name of the series.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the SE tag system does not fit our need: what we want is something like the ability to create tab groups; @senshin has a [post](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1199/8486) that keeps track of the non-series tags. It's not our purpose to write a synopsis for each possible series tag out there. An excerpt is only needed if a tag is confusing, no way around it. If it's simply misnamed, we should first try to give it a better name so people won't misuse it, kind of like refactoring code and giving functions meaningful names. The excerpts are comments that are only a last resort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gao (Incidentally, thanks for reminding me about that query; I've updated it.)


















It's kinda rare, but unfortunately, bad writing exists, and sometimes the question asked is about a very badly written, poorly executed or hastly planned narrative.
Sometimes the plot twist is forced to give a specific resolution, even if it makes not much sense.  

So, my question is, is bad writing an acceptable answer to questions when they are about shoddly written events?
If so, is there a way to safely identify bad writing?

I have a question about the anime adaptation of Rewrite. The answer to my question might be in the original visual novel, but I'm reluctant to buy it and play it for forty hours just on the off-chance it explains a minor element of an anime that, in all honesty, I didn't enjoy that much. On the other hand, if the VN does have the answer, I fear that people will end up downvoting the question for lack of research - "you'd know this if you played the VN".

If I have a question about an anime adaptation, and the answer happens to be in the source material, can I safely ask the question?

Yes, it would be on topic. I don't see why this would be a worry.

you are right that the Visual Novel takes a while to complete and there are multiple routes. https://vndb.org/v751VNDB lists its length as


  Very long (> 50 hours)


but I don't know if this is for getting all the endings.

There's also no official translation as such the only (and legal) way to get it in English is to buy the original Japanese game and download and install Amaterasu Translations's patch. Otherwise, if you can read Japanese you can skip the patch.

These 2 things can sometimes be a barrier to some fans who will instead stick to the anime, as such no one should be downvoting you for not having played the Visual Novel. This is like downvoting any anime question because you haven't read the manga it was based off from. A lot of the time (like Attack on Titan, One Piece, Naruto etc) it's because the anime is further back and not everyone has access to the manga legally (some people avoid the scanlations holding out for official localization). 

Likewise downvoting a Studio Ghibli Film question for not having read the original book the movie is from which isn't a well-known fact, or Kantai Collection questions because you didn't play the browser-based game which accesses originally was based off a lottery.

Just because an anime is an adoption or was based on another media doesn't mean seeing that media is a requirement, so I wouldn't worry too much. Generally, if something would be a lack of research, you'd ideally get a comment explaining how you didn't do enough research and you can find out for sure or not if your question is happy answered or not.

I want to ask a question about AMV. 

For example, "Does anyone know who made this AMV ? I cant find who's the author is"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we ask question about AMV?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5idk, it sounds a bit like id request.

This question got posted: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/42876/what-are-the-value-of-these-trigun-booksWhat are the value of these Trigun books?

And I'd like to ask the site users: Do you think it's a good idea to allow these kinds of questions on our site? Or do you think we should redirect people to specialized forums and remove such questions?

I don't think any StackExchange site openly supports evaluating how much a rare comic book, piece of merchandise, hardware or coins could be worth to collectors. Is it a good thing or a bad thing? What do you think it would bring to the site in terms of informational value?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are we going to allow monetary appreciation questions for rare manga books and merchandise?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Might be worthwhile to point out that besides the mentioned question, there only seems to be [one other](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8811/how-much-is-guyver-manga-video-collection-worth) such question at the time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems like a skillset that we collectively do not possess, and are unlikely to ever possess. I suppose if somebody wanted to know what the retail price of a piece of merchandise is, that would be fine (albeit uninteresting). But appraisals? We probably shouldn't have those.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure about this. On one hand, I believe it's possible to do appraisal by comparing to old-book shop/auction price *if the product is clear* (e.g. the Guyver collection is clear, but the Trigun doujinshi **is not identified yet, making another problem**). But on the other hand, I can't see it being useful in the long run if we're going to follow SE's mission, to build a quality knowledge repository, not to be a personal helpdesk...


















Are we going to allow monetary appreciation questions for rare manga books and merchandise?

I would say no, as https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/users/2516/aki-tanakaaki tanaka mentions in the comments. 


  I can't see it being useful in the long run if we're going to follow SE's mission, to build a quality knowledge repository, not to be a personal helpdesk


The answers would most likely only be tailored I to the asker, and nobody else. 

I also doubt the regular Anime & Manga fan has any knowledge of (rare) manga books, besides the info a simple google would provide.

do you think we should redirect people to specialized forums and remove such questions?

I would suggest we close the questions as off-topic and invite them to join us in chat.

In the chat, somebody might be able to identify the price, or point people in the right direction.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While some information can be gotten via Google, there are almost always better sources for this. Yahoo Auctions has a closed auction search which is pretty useful. Suruga-ya and Mandarake (and maybe others) advertise the prices they will pay for most merchandise in their database even if they don't have it in stock, and they tend to be about half of the sale prices on average. There are plenty of other sources too. For much rarer items it may be hard to put a price on, but for 99% of things I think we can at least give a rough estimate backed by objective evidence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Additionally, while any individual member may not be knowledgeable about a large amount of merchandise, as a whole we may have a fair bit of expertise among us (for example, I can pretty confidently estimate the value of any idolm@ster merchandise to within a factor of 2 if not better). The point being, I don't agree with your claim that we can not do better than Google can on questions of this type. I don't have a strong opinion on the other arguments though right now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LoganM And that is precisely the reason we should invite them to the chat instead, as people such as yourself still might be able to help them. However, lack of knowledge shouldn't necessarily be a reason for not accepting the questions, hence I scrapped that statement.


















Years ago I asked this question on meta if https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/964/1587ID requests on doujins were on-topic. The implied answer from the comment was that they were if the question was written well enough. 

After that, we blacklisted ID request with the exception that we had to be iding something from within a series.

Recently, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/42905/1587this question was asked to ID a shounen ai/yaoi fanfiction that used One Piece as the setting.

Now considering that this is from a known series, would it still meet our exception for ID requests? 



Also, would a doujin (which is too a fan-made) also be an exception to the rule if example pages were shown? (using the example from my previous question, if I had posted the page of Presea pregnant with Alicia with her rather than just described it)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are identifying fan-made works on-topic if they are from a known series?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a bit similar like the question asking for specific episodes. But I think the fact that it was from a doujin makes it even harder to answer than the usual id-req. But then again a harder question doesn't make it off topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think this is more answerable than a typical ID request. How many original, recognizable works are there sans fan-works? And how indistinguishable from each other are, on average, fan works to a given popular title? I feel like it's a level deeper into niche knowledge, and we're already out of our depth with regular IDs, so this would be even less answerable. Much less useful to any future site visitors!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agree 100% with @Hakase. (Alternative approach: whenever somebody asks one of these questions, we just write a fanfic that conforms to all of their specifications and then link to it. Problem solved!)


















Right now the text of it is this:


  Identification questions are off-topic, because they tend to attract low-quality and low-effort posts. The community has decided to no longer support these questions. Please refer to http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2805/what-wed-like-to-do-about-those-gosh-darn-identification-requests-questionsthis meta post for additional details.


The meta post it links to explains why IDs are not allowed, but doesn't immediately offer help. It should.

Let's change the "why" to "how can I still get my answer".

This meta post was proposed in chat: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2488/where-else-can-i-go-for-identification-helpWhere else can I go for identification help?

If you have other meta posts in mind for this, or if you think we should create a new very minimalistic meta post for people who we know don't like to read much, you're welcome to post below.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's change the ID request close reason plaque to redirect askers to other sitesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What noticable benefit can be derived from such a change? We shouldn't be redirecting traffic when all we need to do is discourage it. Other communities might not appreciate us dumping things on them, even if it gives them extra traffic or new users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You mention that most don't read. Even if we do this there will still be new users that ignore the notice, no matter how hard or fast we push it. IMO its better to discourage and close as we have done now and focus efforts elsewhere.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @кяαzєя. If most of the users we still get who ask ID requests are the kind who don't read directions, it seems like a stretch to think that they will go to a post that we direct them to, read the answers there, go to the other sites that allow ID questions, read their directions regarding identification questions, and post a useful contribution there as defined by that community. We can help the ones who come to us looking for help, but beyond that I don't think we need to do anything here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might be right. But what if this close plaque sets the person on the path of reading such notices and solving these problems on their own? I don't know if I could say it's a bad thing then. I know we don't *need* to do anything more to help *our* site not get worse with this topic at this point, but what are we *losing* by suggesting a way to find answers elsewhere? How much effort would it cost to just add some helpful links? If it's to the sites which openly accept ID requests, I don't think there could be any harm.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you suggesting to migrate them or just adding the 'Where else can I go for identification help' question to our close reason? I don't see any harm if we just add that question on our close reason but we shouldn't migrate id request on another siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for opening the meta post, it was proposed by me [on the chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/40662103#40662103). I have to admit the proposal was on impulse, thus I haven't put more explanation. The reason I asked that because on [android.se] (where I was highly active participating before) has an off-topic "development-related" reason which links to [Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/371). That's actually the idea for this proposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Darjeeling I only meant referring users to sites outside of the StackExchange network for identification requests. If anyone understood it as migrating to SciFi for example, I meant no such thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase - I'm pretty sure that SFF:SE would be delighted to accept your unwanted ID questions, as long as they look like they contain some element of science fiction or fantasy. I was going to suggest a formal migration path to make things easier for y'allb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard there should be a meta agreement on SFF, it's not for us here to decide on A&M if they'll accept it. I'll post a proposition in chat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase - Since ID questions are widely accepted as on-topic on SFF, I can't imagine there will be any problem whatsoeverb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I posted your comments in their chat, let's wait for someone to reply https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/58631/the-restaurant-at-the-end-of-the-universeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've opened the relevant meta on Meta:SFF - [Should we offer a migration path to Anime story-ID questions?](https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11552/should-we-offer-a-migration-path-to-anime-story-id-questions). I can't see any reason why it wouldn't attract a decent level of support. Give us your poor, tired huddled mass of ID questioners, yearning to be answered.


















The main worry that I have is that (to use programmer terminology) this creates an extra "dependency" on a meta post. That forces us to keep the meta post useful, complete, and up to date, which is not an easy task. Right now the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2488/where-else-can-i-go-for-identification-helpsuggested meta post hasn't been updated in 2 years. When it was written, we still allowed identification requests. The answers focused on what was wrong at the time with a single user's particular questions (which were notably low-effort and came in large numbers) and what would need to be changed to have them be allowed here. The situation has changed drastically since then, and 90% of the content in the answers there will not help a user here who is looking to ask identification questions. The one useful piece of content is 2 links to other sites which are claimed to accept identification questions, but little direction is presented for how to acceptably ask there. So it already fails on the "useful" mark.

We could alleviate that by writing a new meta post that would actually be useful (or editing the old one but a new one seems more appropriate). Specifically, we could list in answers various other sites that allow identification questions and their policies on them. A complete list would have much more than 2 sites. I don't know all sites which allow identification questions but I can think of at least 5 which are relatively big.

Overall this would be a fair bit of effort, but we wouldn't be done yet. In all likelihood the situation here will not change substantially for years. There is no suggestion to unban identification requests that I can see, and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4096/24as I've argued before it seems likely that the incoming ones aren't going to slow down much no matter what we do because they're coming from people who aren't bothering to read directions (which are very clear and easy to find). Hence, the meta post will be relevant for years, and so we also have to keep the meta post up to date. If those sites change policies, we have to stay up to date on that and edit the post. Given what I've seen in the past here, it's very likely that we won't keep it completely up to date for years (which isn't intended as criticism; this is just not the type of content SE does well with). At that point, we're doing a disservice to anyone who reads the post, because they can get better, more up-to-date information from Google easily.

As I argued in the comments above, the users who come here asking ID requests have already demonstrated that they aren't likely to read directions, so spending a lot of effort on trying to write more directions for them is probably not worth the effort. For the few who do honestly ask for help finding other places (in comments, meta, or chat), we can make suggestions. However, I think making a canonical source for those and linking to it in the UI will just end up creating a lot more work for us that will ultimately not even make much difference. Actually if they have enough information for the question to be answerable, we can usually just direct them to chat and it's likely someone can answer, and if not we can at least provide better guidance on where else to ask than a mostly static meta post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All valid points, but you're assuming a certain level of effort in creating a new redirection meta post. I say let's not try too hard to summarize every other site's policy and etiquette on posting ID requests. Let's just list some of them and indeed preface it all with a sentence about how easy it is to find these sites on your own. It really does not require much effort on the asker's part, and so let's not expend more than required of our own. But still more than "let's not change the close plaque text at all" :p


















Are there any progress for re-designing the Anime StackExchange site ? Or is that post just a "proposal" or discussion that will be done in the near future ?

We've now been waiting for 4 years for a design. For the sites that have had designs made, it took just a matter of weeks between when the design team began work and when they had a draft ready.

Of course, only an SE employee can definitively answer this question, but if they're too busy to pay any attention to this it wouldn't be a surprise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't even want a different design anymore. *This* is A&M's design to me. If it were anything else, it would take a bit of time to get used to. Designs shouldn't be annoying first of all, so if the design team decides to copy just about any of the usual "anime site" designs with random art, it's gonna be annoying. Maybe if they come up with an almost invisible pattern of vaguely anime-related icons, it will be alright, but anything more prominent than that I don't think will be generally well received.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase i would probably kind like this design

Unfortunately, a design for this community’s not currently being actively worked on. The design team is stretched pretty thin at the moment, and no new designs are being worked on for the foreseeable future — which means I can’t give you an estimate for when a design for our site would be rolled out.

I know that's a frustrating answer, but I'd rather be totally realistic and open with you, than unduly optimistic.

So I was busy typing up a question asking when Aizen switched with Momo in Bleach. As I was typing, I saw the question https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/12987/1587Aizen vs Everyone which asked more or less the same thing, but asking when Aizen activated Kyoka Suigetsu and switched with Momo.

The answer that the question received answered the first part which I already knew, but it didn't actually answer the second part which was what I was about to ask.

Would it be better if I asked my question on just the switching of Momo? Or would I be better served requesting a more complete answer?

For example, 

What's happened to anime B localisation in western ? Why it got canceled ?

Or

What's happened to the visual novel B in western localisation ? Why it got canceled ? or why there is no update from the team after 5 years later ?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can i ask a question about official western localisation of anime/manga/visual novel?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you can even ask for a specific country! e.g. we have [india] tag and [europe] tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While these questions are, in principle, permissible, you will almost never get a satisfying answer to any of them, because in most cases, nobody outside of the specific industry entities that were involved in the localization process will know why a localization did not proceed.


















It depends on the kind of localization (which i use loosely here).

if by localization you mean the official kind then questions like your examples fall onto the border of asking about unannounced future events (like with anime and manga). now given that both your examples ask "Why it got canceled" it would be on the assumption that you can provide a source that indicates that there was an announced released date and possibly also a post that says it's been canceled

If by localization you mean by fans (as "no update from the team" made me think of a fan translation who gives out regular updates) then generally no. while your second example question talks about a Visual Novel these would fall into the category of Scanlations and Fan Subs which has generally been (at least to my understanding) our policy of not allowing question like 


  when will [scanlator] release chapter/episode # of [series]?


as these translations https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2003-06-08/3according to this Anime News Network article are legally in the wrong. while the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/406/1587official response from SE is that Mod's aren't lawyers and thus don't need to enforce any law we don't want to do anything obviously boneheaded, as such a question like 


  What's happened to Rewrite: Harvest festa!'s western localisation? Has it been canceled? or why there is no update from the team in Amaterasu Translations after 2 years since the site's last blog post?


would be off-topic.1. if you're not sure if a team/group are doing official or fan translations you can ask here on the Meta site or https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697on The Maid Cafe before hand so you can avoid accidently asking something off-topic



1: while we would close it i would argue it if the question was self answered with a statement indicating that the fan translation stopped because of an announcement of an official translation

Some people on SciFi.SE seem willing to accept identification request https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11552/23127and is asking on their meta if the community wants. 

As for now, we don't have the option to properly migrate them. Should we migrate science fiction and fantasy related identification requests to SciFi.SE?

I think a lot of our users here want nothing to do with ID requests anymore, and we wouldn't mind if they (SciFi users) filtered through them and took what they like. (comment if you disagree)

Migration requires 5 votes (if I'm not mistaken), but I don't think anyone here wants to think about whether it's a worthy question to migrate. Because there is a "don't migrate crap" policy and SciFi has their own set of rules for ID request quality, this is kind of a headache.

If the SciFi users really want this to happen, they'll have to follow all of our newly posted questions. In chat, https://chat.stackexchange.com/users/-179/sakamoto?tab=recentSakamoto does this for our room, and they could also subscribe to the same feed in their chat room to monitor new questions. Then SciFi users would have to come and vote to migrate if they deem it useful.

So this is a way to enable this without requiring any extra action from our users or moderators.

Yes, absolutely we should take them up on their offer. Having to close and delete ID questions is a hassle, but that doesn't mean that we can't still take a few extra seconds to point those users to somewhere they might find help.

As has been pointed out, waiting for a five user quorum (for a formal migration) is probably the wrong way to go with this. Since these questions are definitely going to be deleted (and hence there will be little controversy over them being migrated instead of deleted), it's far simpler to have the moderators use their powers to move them over as soon as they're seen by raising a custom moderator flag on them.


  "Hey moderator, this would be a good fit for SFF and should be migrated"




What can we flag to migrate?

Anything that meets the following three simple-to-understand conditions; 


Contains science fiction or fantasy content
Not Hentai / Animated pornography
Appears to contain a uniquely identifiable question (so "Help. I'm trying to remember a story about a giant robot" would be a no but "Help. What is this story about a giant robot called an Eva" would be a yes)


If there are any problems, the migration will simply get rejected but as long as you've followed the three rules above, the chances of that happening are next to zero.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5one little problem: our mods might not be in the mood to figure it all out, and it might end up either being "everything migrated" or "nothing migrated". If it's possible for the SciFi mods (who are not mods on A&M) to do this, then sure, no issues. I mean we collectively decided to stop thinking about IDs here because it brings everybody's mood down, including our moderators. So… I guess we can wait to hear what they think about this now. Currently there are 2 active mods here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase - It's not a high volume exercise. I'm sure your mods can handle an extra couple of custom flags a week :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There were at least three identification questions posted today, so it's potentially a lot more flags than that. Your suggestion essentially comes down putting the burden on the moderators here to decide whether the crap that gets posted here wouldn't be considered crap on the Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack Exchange site. Also note the standard for moderation approval of migrations is supposed to be high. It should only happen for great questions that the moderator is sure is on-topic on the destination site: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/247250/how-important-is-migrationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge - Looking at the Sakamoto feed in chat, it would appear that only one of those ID questions contained any "*science fiction or fantasy content"*. The other two were a hentai(?) about a pervert and some kind of slice-of-life set in a school. The latter two would have been rejected, the first would have been accepted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RossRidge - [This](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/285467/a-proposed-philosophy-of-question-migration) is a much better target if you're interested in the Meta:SE thinking behind migrations; "*If the question is off-topic or unanswered and the flagger has a good bit of reputation on the target site, go ahead and migrate. - If the question is off-topic but seems reasonably well-written and you understand it well enough to believe it belongs on the target site, migrate.* - Both aspects apply. These questions are off-topic on Anime and firmly on topic on SFFb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just one note: for what it's worth, mods rarely just migrate stuff to other sites willy-nilly (at least from my experience). Instead, the most common way mods go about migration is by asking mods from the other sites on a per-question basis, in the Teacher's Lounge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat - Indeed, but given the volume (approx 3-4 per week at present rates) and the fact that Anime:SE is blanket deleting these questions, I thought a more formal arrangement would be more worthwhile.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sure the point has been discussed in earlier threads, but blanket closing of these ID requests is the opposite of newbie-friendly.  Sure, some of the posters are one-time only posters anyway.  But some have the potential to become active in the community if they don't feel completely shut down on their first post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm actually puzzled by the amount of resistance this proposal is getting, but I don't participate here much anymore so I haven't said much. One thing I do want to point out: when we did id requests here we had a lot of requests for porn that no one (including the user asking the question) knew were for porn until someone had answered the question. Supposing the tide turned and people supported this idea (I know senshin has been tossing some over to you guys), how okay are you guys with getting the occasional accidental porn request?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda - We have a reasonable tolerance for adult content as long as there's no explicit pictures or messy descriptions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard Thanks, good to know. A related problem could be if someone who doesn't want to look at tentacle porn unwittingly goes Googling for an answer to one of these questions and gets an eyeful of something horrific. Not much to do about that, but it's something to be aware of.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Torisuda - If you've gotta go hunting for it, you're probably old enough to be tolerant of it :-)


















If SF&F wants these questions (god knows why they would), I am happy to kick any new ones we get that are sufficiently science-fictional or fantastical over to them. 

I do not support opening a formal migration path (i.e. making SF&F a migration target available to non-moderator close-voters) at this time. For the time being, it would be better for migration candidates to be identified in the following ways:


users see potential migration candidates and cast custom flags indicating they should be migrated to SF&F
I and other moderators directly migrate candidates to SF&F if we catch them before they are deleted
I (and possibly other moderators) look through our closed/deleted questions every so often (maybe a couple times a week) for candidates that got wiped out before we had a chance to look at them, and evaluate them for undeletion + migration as appropriate


If this works, we can then work on opening a formal migration path and encouraging non-moderator close-voters to directly migrate without need for moderator intervention. 



I do have some concerns about this. Chief among them is SF&F's requirement that the identification request "Appears to contain a uniquely identifiable question". This is a nebulous and ill-defined requirement. We have had various debates about similar requirements on this site (back before we'd banned id-reqs altogether), and my stance has always been that one simply cannot know (in the vast majority of cases) whether the text of an id-req uniquely identifies a single work. I will make a good-faith attempt to guess whether a question uniquely identifies a single work (or whether such information could be coaxed out of the asker with nominal effort), but it is entirely possible that my sense will not align with SF&F's voters' senses and we will get a lot of rejected migrations as a result.

Also, to be blunt, our id-reqs have historically been substantially lower-quality than SF&F's and you're probably not going to like them once they start appearing on your site. Doubly so, given that the id-reqs we get these days are exclusively from people who have no presence on this site and have not read any of the site rules, and hence are probably not inclined towards putting substantial effort into their questions.



But anyway, tl;dr: my take is that users should cast custom flags for migration, and we'll look at them. (Not starting immediately, though; we should wait a bit for our two metas to settle into a consensus. We moderators are also discussing this matter amongst ourselves [as, at least initially, it would be us upon whom the burden of this migration stuff would fall].)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Uniquely identifiable" simply means that the user hasn't simply identified a [common trope](http://tvtropes.org/) as being the thing that's memorable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that questions that would get insta-deleted here seem to be pretty well received on SFF; https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/175064/what-anime-is-the-clip-mentioned-below-fromb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Echoing Richard, it doesn't actually have to be uniquely identifiable.  It just has to not consist entirely of the sentence *I saw this anime with a girl who had a funky transformation sequence who is she?*  As long as it broadly looks like the person is describing a particular story, we're entirely content to just leave it open and unanswered indefinitely or until they provide more detail.  We already have [a ton of unanswered story ID questions anyway](https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11413/36526).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5been two months and it's currently what we do I decide to accept this answer


















I do not think we we should. I see no benefit at all in a migration path. It just puts more effort on the moderation staff to handle all the things, as regardless of infrequently as these questions occur. As many have mentioned in the comments, it puts lot of unnecessary burden on the moderation staff.

If people are adamant about this happening, I'd suggest for certain conditions for migration. If SFF.SE wants our identification-type questions that fit their criteria, they will need to establish a set of clearly definable criteria and actively request questions for migration on a case by case basis. It is not the responsibility if the moderation staff to actively monitor and migrate these questions. 

If users from the other communities would like our off-topic questions, they should make an attempt to participate in our community for them. If we wanted something similar from their community, I would ask for the same amount of participation from our users.

The moderators have dealt with these questions for almost 3 years and a quite weary of them. We're familiar with how a vast majority of the question are not very comprehensible or sometimes even relevant to anime. 

We allow questions on the topic of hentai, as long as it does not involve explicit material or details (yes, it gets tricky to draw the line, but we manage), as it violates the content policy. Without a set criteria it's hard to say what works and what doesn't. Different communities do things differently after all. How some users define "fantasy" is questionably subjective in my opinion. Talking animals doing human like thing can be considered "fantasy-like", while something setting like Charlotte's Web might not. Ambiguity and subjectivity will just more difficult for everyone in the long run.

The Stack Exchange community works the way it does thanks to it's community and users. If there is a set criteria to match questions appropriate for migration, I don't see the problem with it, if community pitches in to help.

Additionally, there is no merit in the migration of historically locked questions. The whole reason they are locked and not completely deleted is to reminded users of the deprecated nature of these question. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I fully agree re: historically-locked questions. Those certainly shouldn't go anywhere. As for this needing to be a community-driven effort rather than a moderation-driven effort - I agree that in the long-run, moderator-based curation of migratable questions is not sustainable, but I think it's reasonable to try that as a "pilot" of sorts. (Which is not to say that _you_ should have to spend any time doing that, but I think it is worthwhile, so I would if we end up agreeing that this is something worth trying.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This has been discussed before. In short, We've decided that a work merely having talking animals *in it* isn't defined as fantasy unless their presence is somehow fantastical; https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5117/are-anthropomorphic-animals-by-themselves-enough-to-deem-a-work-fantasy. That being said, I'm struggling to think of any anime/manga where the characters are personified animals.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've been keeping an eye on the queues for the past couple of weeks. The volume of relevant migrations is probably about 3-4 per week, hardly something that qualifies as a substantial volume of extra work, especially when split between 3 mods.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You don't see any benefits over migrating them somewhere they're welcome over deleting them with a terse message about not being welcome here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't either. What benefits do you propose?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I try put the interest of the moderation staff and this community before anything else when it comes to new policies. You seem to prescribe that your community is doing us a favor by taking these unwanted questions off our hands, however our mods will likely be left with the brunt of the labor. The infrequency of these questions, as to pass it off a minor triviality. The main issue I see with this request is that your community comes in and ask us to migrate questions, but offer to contribute little to nothing in return. If this was an equivalent exchange, I wouldn't have any particulars.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron - Well, treating new users with respect, even if their first question is a bit naff.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@кяαzєя - The return is happy, engaged users (anime fans, to boot) who'll stick around in the network and may see other questions they'd like to ask/answer. As it stands you're simply pushing them away and telling them how unwelcome they are, period.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anime fans aren't the type to be engaged, they are primarily motivated by their own self interest and unmotivated by sloth most of the time. We've had some pretty bad ones in the past, like one individual working for or volunteering at museum in the Southern US asking us to identify possibly hundreds of anime cels, but got stopped my the question post limit. We dealt with and tried to reason with them many times in many ways, with very low returns. It's a matter of give and take here you will get as much out of it as you put in. We'll gladly work with you if you put in the time and effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@кяαzєя: I see where you're coming from, but this "equivalent exchange" would be a lot easier on us if y'all didn't aggressively delete these questions before anyone could look at them... most of us don't have the rep to view deleted.  It's a bit unrealistic to expect us to comb Google's cache for these things.  Frankly, I also think you were so quick to quote Fullmetal Alchemist that you forgot its moral: *Life doesn't have to be a zero-sum game.*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Humankind cannot gain something without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. Unlike SFF.SE, the rep required to see deleted questions is still at pre-graduation thresholds, 2k, and not likely to change any time soon. If you want these questions all you need to do is participate in the community. It doesn't take that much effort.


















Just gonna leave a couple of thoughts here.

First, it doesn't seem reasonable to me for this community and its mods to have to take the burden of quality controlling these questions for another community, since they've been considered off-topic here. If SF&F found a way to make it work for them, awesome — but it shouldn't be expected for this community to go around and make sure questions check all the boxes in SF&F's quality guidelines for these types of questions.

It would also be unreasonable, however, to just migrate everything wholesale there, since most of the id-req stuff that gets posted here is low-quality (one of the reasons we ended up doing away with 'em).

Both of those reasons seem like pretty good reasons not to enable the migration path, to me.

Now, that being said, I do know that there's some overlap between users of both communities... so if anyone who is really active at SF&F and familiar with their guidelines sees something here they definitely think is a good fit there, great! Leave a comment suggesting the asker re-post their question on SF&F (and delete the one they posted here).

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4134/49As Hakase mentions, you can always follow our bot in the main chat room, and drop some guidance when something interesting that'd be a good fit on SF&F is found.

This way, the question isn't orphaned: if the asker cares enough to join a new site and re-ask it, they probably also care enough to stick around and respond to clarifications, add necessary details, accept a correct answer if one arises...

And if they're already gone, no additional work is needed - we can just neatly leave it in our curb until the garbage man comes by... that is, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2824/49the community deletes it. 

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4133/should-we-migrate-scifi-related-identification-request-to-scifi-se?cb=1#comment8368_4134Richard mentions we delete these new questions too quickly for anyone to react, though. Well... that's great, to be honest! Because it means we clean up our front page real quick :) But, to the point of this discussion: the close reason can always be slightly edited, so it gently points these users to SF&F — I don't think it'd make everyone who asks these questions here go there, but some of the most attentive ones might... and hopefully that's the subset of people who ask better quality id-reqs? IT could, however, have the exact same result as dumping all of these questions on SF&F, so I'm not so sure it'd be a great idea. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Relying on users from another site to flag is not feasible. I've been checking in 5 times a day and I'm still missing about 50% of them. Luckily most get cached but expecting a custom flag is just unreasonable. The entire point of the migration pathway is to give users an *alternative* to simple deletion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard: "to give users an alternative to simple deletion." - This is not a good alternative when it means having to commit to decide that it will work for a different community, and it shouldn't be our reviewers' problem to figure out which option is better. It needs to be straightforward otherwise it is a big toll for effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron - I fail to see why everyone think's it's so amazingly hard to apply two simple tests; A) is it fantasy/scifi? B) Does it look uniquely answerable? If that's the case then that means it's **off-topic here but on-topic elsewhere**, which is the entire reason that migration exists.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard "Does it look uniquely answerable?" - If it is an identification request, no.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard Sorry, I think you're missing the point here. It will be a lot of work for us because we're not you. We don't know what constitutes an answerable post in terms of Sci-Fi and we've already established that ID-reqs tend to be crap. **Both *"Help. I'm trying to remember a story about a giant robot"* and *"Help. What is this story about a giant robot called an Eva"* are the same to us and now we're expected to guess that Sci-Fi will accept the second question despite both being as low quality.**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron - In my experience most are. You do occasionally get a stinker but they're pretty rare. It's not hard to work out which are irrationally vague and which aren'tb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron - And again we're talking about one or so candidates every two days. Not big volumes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard Adding a migration option would also mean **every new identification request** with more than a line needs to be scanned for fantasy. Having to cast judgement **while not having an unambiguous criteria** makes it even more of a chore. This was supposed to be an alternative to simple deletion, so it needs to be easy to use. "Uniquely answerable" is not specific - **voting "does it belongs on superuser.com" from SO is not work at all, answering "does it look uniquely answerable" to a question that is inherently incomplete (which is why identification is requested) is not.**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Unihedron - It strikes me that there's a real streak of "*these people should be punished because they're asking questions that we've decided are off-topic"* in the answers that I'm seeing rather than "*We should make some effort to help these users even though they've asked a question that's off-topic"*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard It doesn't strike me and I encourage you to do research on why they are deemed off-topic and banned in the first place. This discussion is both going off-topic and unconstructive in regards to addressing the actual answer in question so I'm going to drop it. You're welcome to have an extended discussion in chat or add points to your existing (or a new) answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel like you're missing the point, @Richard: this community spent a _huge_ amount of time trying to curate these types of question, and keeping them in our site. We had a set of criteria. We went through the trouble of asking the users to include more details. And then we finally decided to stop doing that, because it was too much trouble for the benefit of a very little amount of users — users that weren't even gonna contribute to the community either. After all that, it is not reasonable to ask _this community_ to check if question comply to a set of guidelines _set by another community_.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(cont.) Especially, as I stated before, after we had our own, and decided to get rid of 'em. It just feels like you're asking this community to do a job they stated pretty clearly they didn't wanna do any more. I'd advise you read [this post](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2805/49) and all the other ones linked to from it — it provides a really thorough overview of the community's fight against these, and why it seems so unreasonable of you to ask us to do this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat - I recognise how much time you spent getting to this point. The question is how to most effectively engage with these users *from this point onward* in a constructive way. Simply deleting their questions and making them feel unwelcome doesn't feel constructive, especially when another site within the Stack is willing and able to take their questions enthusiastically.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's all cool, but now we get to that bit of the discussion that just throws us into a circle: you can't expect _this community_ to check for whether or not guidelines _set by another community_ are being met. Unless there's something in this discussion that throws us out of this loop, Imma drop it here ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd be happy with modifying the close reason, though I think it's kind of confusing when the close reason *only mentions SFF.SE if it has SciFi element* (kind of discriminating, eh?). Instead, I'd really like to reconsider this: [Let's change the ID request close reason plaque to redirect askers to other sites](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4123/2516)


















Y'know, I'm late to the conversation and I'm late to how this has panned out, but from my perspective we've been doing this for at least most of December.

My take on this:

I hate it.

I hate the idea of giving another community the detritus that we genuinely didn't want.  It makes me think that we're giving them hand-me-downs that have been utterly ruined in ways both imaginable and unimaginable.

I hate the idea of catering to a demographic of user who is only here for an instant, who only want to engage based on this one premise, and will not add positively to any community.  I get that I'm painting a group of people with a broad brush, but https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1193/do-identification-request-questions-attract-users-that-dont-contribute-to-the-sthere is some data to back me up on this.

I hate even thinking that these questions are suitable for Stack Exchange's Q&A style period, given that they're really...not.  This gets to the heart of asking what the purpose really is for SciFi.SE.

I hate the idea of migrating what essentially is grunt work; even if the other side of the fence is willing to accept it, it feels like a non-trivial amount of effort for a trivial gain.



I feel like identification questions have no real value anywhere that they go.  I genuinely fear that SciFi may run into the same fork in the road that we did three or so years ago with them.  Learn from our lesson; don't accept any more.  It's not going to make your community any better.  It's not going to make ours any better for sending them over since it won't change the fact that we get them at all.  For those who think that this'll lead to users shifting their attention to SciFi instead...given how often they contribute to the site after they ask an identification question, I have strong doubts.



To go a bit more into providing some data, (at the time of writing) I have access to the stats for migrated questions.

In the last 90 days (from 2 January 2018):


10 questions have been migrated to SciFi.SE


Of those 10 questions:


All of them score above zero


2 score above 10

None of the OPs have registered accounts on the site after migration (a problem for a site trying to become full-fledged, may be less of a problem for already full-fledged sites)
6 have at least one answer


2 have more than one answer



To put that into perspective with Area 51's applicable metrics, which are:


An average of 2.5 answers per question
90% of questions answered


The migrated questions have:


An average of 0.9 answers per question
60% of questions answered


I entirely recognize that this is early days and that these are a small sample set.  However, I'm not convinced that just accepting these questions from us is going to be the best approach here, nor do I feel like it's going to improve either community in the long run.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We like them. We like them a lot. We like answering them and making new users happy and we have a hard core of users who positively thrive on these questions. More = Better, especially in the small additional volumes that Anime:SE could potentially provideb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, treating this "*demographic of user*" as second-class citizens isn't an  especially nice attitude.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard:  Thanks for for your feedback.  However, the numbers aren't misleading there; the users who do ask these kinds of questions tended not to stick around here.  It's tough for me to get excited or motivated to help those sorts of users if they're not going to positively help a community build or grow.  Given that A&M is still relatively infant and hasn't fully graduated yet, I feel like we do want to emphasize lasting user contributions, content and users who want to help out with making this site succeed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard:  Honestly - and I am just being honest - I don't feel like they're the sort of user we should be optimizing for.  I get it if SciFi wants to, but I don't feel like we should be sending them over the fence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We want them sent over the fence, thank you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard:  I'm really not trying to be argumentative, but I'm not seeing a compelling reason here *to* send them over besides, "Yes, we'll take them."  I'm not seeing any information as to how you've prevented the situation from spiraling out of control, nor have I seen any evidence from SciFi's perspective that users that *do* ask those sorts of questions actually stick around.  If I could have maybe one or two of those concerns allayed, I'll happily withdraw my point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, entirely ignoring the fact that one of your moderators started by asking a low-quality ident question, we've now had at least three of the users who've had their questions manually migrated join the site proper and one of those has asked a further (Harry Potter) question. I'd call that a win, although what I thought would be a trivial ask (can we, sure you can) has turned into something a lot more involved.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard:  I did say that I didn't want to *optimize* those sorts of users, not outright ignore them.  We've *genuinely* been spurned by them in the past, and I get that not all of them were bad; some of them turned out to be fantastic.  However, I don't see the data to suggest that these sorts of questions have contributed positively to SciFi.SE, nor do I feel particularly assured by "Yes, we'll take them on" as the only real reason to send them over.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, the questions that have been sent over have received substantial numbers of upvotes (indicating community approval) and where answered, they've had a similar number of upvotes and very few downvotes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Richard:  I've added some more stats into this.  I think I fully understand SciFi's position on this, but I don't feel that my concerns have been allayed any less from it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the metric are a bit misleading. These are story ID questions. Having ***multiple competing answers*** suggests a failure rather than a success.


















IMO for such questions, the OP should demonstrate why they believe the cosplay, merchandise, or itasha that needs to be identified is, in fact, anime or manga related. Simply posting a picture and saying "I found this" and asking "what is this" should not be adequate.

Even if the OP mistakes LoL cosplay for anime cosplay, if they are uninformed and assumed it to be anime as they say it in an anime section at a local comic convention and explained the circumstances of why they thought it was anime/manga related, I think they should be fine even if the answer is its not anime but it us from X franchise. If they explain the context and why they are asking, I think we should give them a chance. Most casual fans can't really tell what's from anime and what's just anime-like IMO. 

These tags have definite artefacts to work off of. They are not necessarily easily reversed image searched as they are not directly from visual media, so IMO they are worthwhile questions to answer.

It's almost February in 2018, which isn't supposed to be the proper time to cycle these, but for this year it'll be once again, so we'll be refreshing the Community Promotion Ads for this year now!

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


the site's twitter account
review blogs and research websites to keep on top of each new season
events, meetups, and conventions
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/4144here.

(ie. the twitter one if we got a design with a new icon later on)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the image changes and the ad is already voted up, the new image will be used for the rest of the cycle. Outside of circumstances exactly as you're referring to (i.e. actual branding changes for whatever is being adverted), it's usually good courtesy to not change the image partway through a cycle once it's already been voted up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can I still make suggestions?

How do people get reputation on this site? I'd really like to know.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Site question: this effects what you can do in the siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know this has nothing to do with anime or manga at all, but I have to know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i have flagged this to be migrated to our Meta site where it should be. that said have you bothered to check [the Help Center](https://anime.stackexchange.com/help) like the pinned ["What is reputation? How do I earn (and lose) it?"](https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since this was migrated to meta, I upv-oted to give poster enough rep to be able to respond there. Otherwise, he would be in a "chicken & egg" situation.  // Well hell, that didn't work. Since this question is actually in anime-meta, an upvote does not gain him any rep. Hello, Chicken! Hello, Egg!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RichF actually if what I have seen on SO if you don't have the rep to participate in Meta but you get your question migrated here then you can participate on the migrated question alone (including answers)


















Whatever the question is, a lot of questions don't get answers because people seem uninterested in it. These questions have one particular thing in common: The user has only 1 rep as a starter, and, the question's time of asking is almost the same as the time when the account is made, so it looks like the account was made for that question only.

That means that people tend to think that the user will probably not follow up and may not even accept an answer. When it may look like the user made the account only for that question, and the question looks rushed, I thought that maybe users with 1 rep should not be able to ask.

I see the point of having them ask or answer at 1 rep, as Dimitri Mx pointed out in the answer below, but that is not exactly what I am trying to say. I am saying that just like tag wiki's low-rep-user edits, they are only visible to the poster until peer-reviewed.

Can we not maintain the site better if we implement that here on anime.stackexchange?



EDIT:

Let me just summarise what I want to say.

Why are first posts that are still in review queue visible on the main page? Just like tag wiki's, if a user has not enough reputation then it is only visible to the user himself/herself until peer reviewed. Similarly, if I don't have enough reputation and I edit a question, it will only be visible to me until peer reviewed.

So why aren't first posts treated in the same way?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why can users ask when their rep is 1?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Uninteresting as it seems, if they're on topic we should leave them. (or answer them if you know the answer) If you think it's not useful or low quality you can always downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not like this site is being spammed with tons of low quality questions like StackOverflow. Rather, we would want as many questions as possible, and there are enough high rep users here to flag/vote to close the questions if they are not up to par. And I haven't seen any site that put up a barrier like that after the user registers for the site. It will drives users away for sure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a review queue for new users already, and we generally deal with the queues quickly, so I suspect this would have relatively little practical effect.


















I am a new user on this site, but I already participate in other sites of the network. So by creating profile here, I gained 100 reputation points.

But by visiting https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/5778/39804this question, I came across the message below, even though I have a reputation above 10:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgizK.jpg

I do not intend to answer this question, but I found it curious to have this restriction, even though I have all the limits of users with more than 100 reputation released.

This is correct or possible bug?

A https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3939/do-we-think-questions-about-where-to-read-watch-legal-anime-or-manga-are-acceprelated question asks if such questions are on topic. Result:


  All of these questioned should be marked as a duplicate of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/922/how-can-i-tell-if-a-site-is-legal/923#923this question.


Problem is, apparently we cannot mark questions on the main site as duplicate of questions on meta. On the other side, I cannot simply refer to the meta site in answer (see e.g. https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/46981/where-can-i-watch-stream-english-subbed-yu-gi-oh-duel-monsters#autocomment61169this question), my answer gets marked as trivial and the question remains open.

So the only insightful answer one could possibly give is an answer about site specializing in X, which seems to be very rare. In all other cases the question cannot be answered, except by repeating the list of the linked meta question or adding general entries (which may turn out to be illegal, or, if not, could just be added to the meta post).

On top of that, this kind of question is a list question and thereby not good by normal SE standards anyway.



The https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp center currently reads as such:


  Questions requesting illegal or copyrighted information: Where can I watch anime X online? Where can I download chapters of manga Y?


I hereby propose to change it to the following


  Questions requesting illegal and/or copyrighted material: Where can I watch anime X online? Where can I download chapters of manga Y? For a list of resources, see https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/922/how-can-i-tell-if-a-site-is-legal/923#923here.


With that change in place, questions like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/46981/where-can-i-watch-stream-english-subbed-yu-gi-oh-duel-monsters#autocomment61169this one can be faithfully be closed as off-topic. I think that this change will help this SE in the long term.



EDIT: To clarify, I don't say anyone asking for a read/watch source is looking for an illegal source. I say we should just ban the "legal" questions of this kind, too. At the other meta post, Gao had some good words:


  You could potentially ask this question for every tag there is/ever will be and in most cases they wouldn't be of interest to more than a few people. Heck, these kinds of questions don't even enrich our understanding of a series or anime/manga in general. They aren't even fun. Do you believe they have a place here?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's mark questions about where to read/watch X (legally) as off-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the past, for identification requests, we moved https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618 from meta to main to be used as a duplicate target. If we really do need to close most of the incoming "where can I find X" questions, that would seem to be a viable option here assuming it is technically feasible (may require CM intervention).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However I am not convinced that all such questions are answered by the content there, and there are often other options in specific cases (e.g. electronic Kindle copies are now common for LNs, at least if you are willing to read in Japanese.) I am not sure a universal policy is justified here, especially since such questions are fairly rare and don't seem to present a threat of overrunning the site.


















First off i would be against using the illegal content close reason if we was to make them off-topic. while your suggestion to edit it is made in good nature, a user who reads that might not think the same.

when a "where can i watch/read" question appears we should assume good faith that the OP isn't looking to pirate but if we close every "where can i watch/read" question as asking for illegal sources then we aren't showing good faith (though though deep inside we suspect that what they are doing) and assuming everyone who asks is a pirate, especially in cases where it could be a legitimate reason like with Tokyo Ghoul:re where geoblocking is preventing US users from watching it on Chrunchyroll while UK and Ireland users can



My opinion is to not make them off-topic but rather following the suggestion that you quoted which would require https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/922/how-can-i-tell-if-a-site-is-legal?noredirect=1&lq=1this question to be moved to the main site which i am sure was suggested before too. 

if it was i would however suggest it's gets marked as protected as a sorta barrier to prevent some users posting spam answers to illegal sites which does happen to some of the questions here (not just "where can i watch/read" ones)

this way when people google "here can i watch/read x" and we get high enough in the search rankings they'll find the duplicate question and get redirected to the list to find a legal source rather than risking an illegal one.

however we shouldn't be so quick to close as duplicate if the list was moved to the main site and rather have it as an option for us to use. reason being is because even if the user wants to stream a series the answer might be they can't for that language. the alternative could be getting the home release or that the release they want just doesn't exist (ie. wanting Monogatari dubbed in english but the best they can do is subbed)



in regards to your answer getting converted, in my opinion it is lacking as it just suggests to look at the list rather give a definitive answer of which site has the release the OP wanted. rather it's more suited as a comment

Right now (and this has been going on for a very long time) the text says this:

Identification questions are off-topic, because they tend to attract low-quality and low-effort posts. The community has decided to no longer support these questions. Please refer to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2805/what-wed-like-to-do-about-those-gosh-darn-identification-requests-questionsthis meta post for additional details.

The link leads to a meta post explaining why we decided to ban ID requests. And it's super long and nobody's got time to read it. Maybe it has some links to self-help, but I'm sure 99% of people who clicked it didn't find it. And I don't think anyone cares why we don't want to help them. The text is official and dry. That's bad close plaque text.
I propose this new text instead:

Of course, we'll need to actually compile those links in a convenient user-friendly self-help meta post.
What do you think?

I just wanted to know what was the rationale(consensus) that led to list-questions becoming off-topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How did list questions become off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think 'list' questions are off-topic, it does however depend on what you wish to be listed, and within which scope it should be listed. Anime recommendations, or genre listings are not accepted. However, take this for example [accepted list question](https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/8580/1458) is on topic


















Lists are not off-topic. Unreasonable and overly board list questions are. Stack Exchange has a problem where users of their community ask for a lot all at once and give little context on what they actually need. Sometimes these questions are answered, most of the time its not due to the effort involved in covering all the important and relevant points. This puts the majority of the burden on those answering or attempting to answer these types of questions. 

When you ask for a list of thing. There are reasonable requests and unreasonable requests based on scope. Much of the time ppl, not being knowledgeable on the scope or depth, ask for unreasonable things. The guideline are there to ensure those asking keep their questions within reasonable bounds in terms of length, complexity, and coverage.

If I asked you to name all the {insert flavor} things you've ever eaten, plus where and when you had them. Would that be reasonable? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No that would not be reasonable :). Yours is a very articulate response. Note that there are no particular tags containing the keyword 'lists' or 'list'. I understand now that 'mainstream lists' like recommendations and such are not acceptable. But the links I have added in my question contain discussions of the time when they were acceptable(it looks like that). Although it seems that the discussions abruptly ended. I am guessing it must be SE policy that such questions are opinion-based/subjective which was implemented in all sites including anime.se, and no further discussion was needed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The meta discussions you have linked are more or less elaborations on policies to fit specific needs. We have general policy for list questions, but we do not want to cross every "t" and dot every "i" as we lack the foresight and resources to cover all possible scenarios. We have a broad policy on these questions that give both moderator and users an idea of how to handle these situations as they come up. As noted but LoganM's [tl;dr](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/471/63). We prefer to give you suggestions on how to handle situations, rather than tell you what you must do explicitly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're not a big community compared to other recreation SEs. There are something we can handle and some things we can't. Support from the community is key. Instead of set rules and regulation we try to be more reasonable with it comes to policy as we understand that different people have different strokes and we can't alway get along in the same matter. We keep policies open ended as we realize not all things are perfect, despite best efforts. If you don't agree with something you're free to let us know what's on your mind. If it's reasonable and has enough support, we'll give it a try.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I couldn't have hoped for a better explanation. It is very clear to me how things are working around here(nice work BTW). However, I believe that anime.se lacks a certain charm for new users(and people recently hooked to anime) because of the lack of lists and list-questions. Moreover, such lists are most sought after in case of anime rather than any other topics or in other SE sites. But again, that is just my opinion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do agree the community lacks charm, but we are and have been a very bootstrapped community. If you feel unsatisfied, feel free to leave your feedback in our meta along with any suggestions you may have for discussion. We'll do what we can to try meeting expectations if it's reasonable.

After Identification Requests were removed we https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3868/1587kept Music Identifications under the prevision that the asker knew the series it came from.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/47779/what-is-the-name-of-the-song-playing-in-the-backgroundA recent question (while an answer to this Meta wouldn't make it any more on-topic regardless of the answer) asked about a Hatsune Miku song. it got me thinking that do knowing that a song is a Vocaloid song count towards our Music Identification Exceptions? do we need any more previsions in regards to Vocaloid Song Identifications beyond knowing it's a Vocaloid song? eg.


Knowing which Vocaloid sang it (Hatsune Miku isn't the only Vocaloid, there's Rin and Ren, Luca, Kaito, Meiko)
Having a link to the song
etc.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does Vocaloid count to our Music Identification Exception?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, if I didn't miscount, searching for ["vocaloid"](https://anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=vocaloid) returned 3 other music ID questions related to Vocaloid: https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/26978, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21927, https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/35660b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka yes but i think the first 2 were before we did the ban and the other is just a general bad music id request where they just use whatever tags as a quick peak at the video shows no vocaloidsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No prob, just want to mention those questions for the sake of completeness of this discussion.


















Just now, there was an ID request question that already had 1 close vote. It appeared with a red dot notification under First Posts, but there was no red dot next to Close votes. This isn't the first time this has happened; I will sometimes be looking at a post that has at least one close vote but the review queue won't say that there is anything under Close Votes. It's not consistent, though--the Close Votes review queue often has a red dot notification, so I know it's not just a universal bug. Is this supposed to happen? Does anyone know why it happens?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why don't questions with close votes always show up in the Close Votes review queue?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a know issue on all SE sites.

Yes. Asking to ID characters or other elements within a known series are still on-topic

First of all...
Anime & Manga Stack Exchange still accepts some kinds of identification requests, particularly if the series is known:

Note that this list is not intended to be exhaustive. The above list contains the types that are known to be acceptable by the community.
If you are still not sure if your identification request is acceptable here, feel free to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=discussion,identification-questionspost a new discussion on the meta (requires 5 reputation).

Otherwise, just https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/askask the question, and the community will evaluate it naturally.

But wait...

If the series has some sci-fi/fantasy elements, our sister site https://scifi.stackexchange.com/Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack Exchange accepts it, whether it is a https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11874/how-to-ask-a-good-anime-manga-story-id-questionseries identification or https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/11486/36437music identification.

For a more general manga/(light) novel, our sister site https://literature.stackexchange.com/Literature Stack Exchange accepts it, but please ensure to follow the guidelines on https://literature.stackexchange.com/tags/story-identification/infothe tag info and https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/778/guidelines-for-good-story-id-questionstheir meta first!

If you have an image of an anime/manga/character, try doing a reverse image search: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21618Where is this picture from? How do I use Reverse Image Search to find the source of an anime/manga image?

If you feel adventurous, you can also try searching through various databases based on criteria such as genre, etc.: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4696What databases and listing sites exist for anime, manga, etc?

Out of all questions since then, only 1 didn't get any downvote: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/49161/do-dolls-in-rozen-maiden-live-like-a-humanDo dolls in Rozen Maiden live like a human?

I observed that all of Naruto questions were asked by the same asker; whether it's considered as serial voting or not, I'll rest the case to mods. However, the rest of the series (Assassination Classroom, Tokyo Ghoul, My Hero Academia, Evangelion, Reincarnated as Slime, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball, Banana Fish, One Piece) ticked my suspicion, whether it was done by a single user or not. It also seems that older questions that got bumped (i.e. "active" tab) were ignored, so it seems the voter is looking at the "newest" tab.

Note that I haven't downvoted any of them since I don't have much knowledge in those series. While I acknowledge I'm one of the most prolific voters on this site, I didn't/couldn't see the reason to downvote on some of the listed questions. Of course, I also know that voting is anonymous, so I don't expect anyone to justify their votes anywhere (but feel free if you want).

Is my suspicion justified? If it is, then is it possible for mods to investigate/escalate this issue to CM, and whether to invalidate the votes if they are indeed bogus?

I'll take a closer look


















There exist https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/36522/who-is-the-most-connected-in-the-six-degrees-sense-seiyuua question asking about the most connected seiyuu by six degrees. As innocent of a question it may seem, but the foundations the question is based on is flawed and unreasonablely scoped.

Kevin Bacon himself thinks this game was a joke in his TEDx talk: https://youtu.be/n9u-TITxwoMhttps://youtu.be/n9u-TITxwoM

He didn't invent the game, but it is permanently associated with him thanks to pop culture.

But what's the problem here? The problem is that we are using a fundamentally speculative assumption to pose another about a similar topic. This will only create more misconception if the basis is not first scrutinized.

The 6 Degrees of Separation from Kevin Bacon Theory is based on a well known theory called the  “small world theory,” a longstanding serious look at the degrees of separation between people. Some look for fun, some like Stanley Milgram looked to explain how events like the atrocities of WWII could happen given how interconnected we all are.

Many “small world” studies have been done throughout the years, from radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi’s thoughts on the subject in the early 1900’s (he guessed 5), to experimental social physiologist Stanley Milgram’s small world experiments in 1967 (which showed 6 degrees), to Microsoft’s 2008 study (which showed average degree of separation is 6.6), and more.

Although most studies have showed the average degree of separation is about 6 (but not exactly), the Microsoft study showed some people are connected by up to 29 degrees. Others, like a person living alone in the jungle, could be completely unconnected. While it is true that Kevin Bacon is connected to a lot of actors, but the same can be said about other actions that have been around for a while. Popularity and fame will get you a ways to to conbecting people, but it's not an end all be all, especially in this age of the internet. Small world studies typically look at who we know in any way, but each study is different.

With Kevin Bacon game, there are specific rules to narrow the scope, such as one must have worked with Kevin Bacon on a professional or personal level to count. 

However, if we count just people we know in any way (including social media) there can be an argument that many people have less than 6 degree today.

To avoid the going on a long winded rant about the finer details of the theory, see this video for a summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcxZSmzPw8khttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcxZSmzPw8k

Such a theory was proposed long ago that everyone on earth is separated by 6 or less acquaintance links apart. This idea was first put forth by Frigyes Karinthy in 1929, and popularized by a 1990 play written by John Guare.

The basic concept (behind the Small World theory) is that due to technological advances in communications and travel, friendship networks could grow larger and span greater distances. In particular, Karinthy believed that the modern world was ‘shrinking’ due to this ever-increasing connectedness of human beings. 

The small world and 6 degrees of separation theories have truth to them, but they are not true as absolutes (only as general rule-of-thumbs that speak of averages with outliers excluded).

Instead of saying “everyone has 6 degrees of separation,” it is much more correct to say, “the average person has around 6 degrees or less between them and another average person (including Kevin Bacon)…. and with social media considered, those with similar interests may very well have less on average.”

Thus, the 6 degrees of separation rule is a rule-of-thumb, it is generally true for most of us, but doesn’t apply to outliers who live unconnected from modern society. 

Trying to apply the same methodology to the Japanese voice acting industry is not a viable approach, in my opinion. Unlike the Hollywood movie industry the Japanese voice acting industry does not command as much respect, attention, or fame. Those that make careers out of it are few and far between, oftentimes the more successful ones move to other more profitable industries, retire, or just fade away into obscurity. Dude to social media the lines have been ever so blurred and hard to distinguish with reasonable objectivity. 

The amount of effort to create an viable and objective answer is unreasonable for the average person. You can ask for all the data you want but if the criteria is too boardly, there will be no end to to comparisons. Do we care about the time period? Connected in terms of what? One assumes their voice actors, but voice actors are many different things, some are singers or idols, others are models, some are also stage or movie actors in their own right. 

We had a similar type of problem with list requests, but in this case its more of a reverse list. Instead of questions like "how many have X in Y". We have "who is the most A in Z." 

There is no reasonable scope or criteria preventing this question from being overly broad. If we limit it to a certsin period, we have limited data available. We can look at work history based on credits, but voice actors also do networking out sude of their roles? How can we talk factors as such into account?

It us in my belief thatanswers are not an appropriate place to be a plase to do a new small world study and we should not be encouraging questions where the answer may as well be a thesis on a bigger topic. 

We need some sort of policy in place to keep questions within reasonable scope or it its founded on a controversial theory or topic. Such a question about voice actors cannot be properly answered without sorting and refercing large amounts of data. Furthermore fact checking such answer for bias is an equally cumbersome ordeal. 

So I ask, what can we do about this issue.

Presumably, someone(s) has done the basic code for the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon game, so there hard work is done.  Therefore, your assumption that this is too difficult is as flawed as you accuse the Kevin Bacon to be.  When mining data like this, vast sums of data make better datasets than small sets.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who will mine this data?

I do not believe we should allow for the proliferation of such questions with putting guidelines in place. We dont want to make people have to spend time crunching numbers and building websites. We're not a technical recreation site like code golf. It's unreasonable to expect such efforts from the average users. We're a recreation site about Japanese cartoon ans comics. There might be some overlap, but its unreasonable to expect such a level of effort from the average user.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Such as but is not limited to: if you put forth a question based on flimsy, questionable, or misrepresented theories or ideas. One must first must provide a reasonable scope for the answer. This will be a minimum criteria, anyone that wants to go beyond it are free to do so.

I honestly don't see the problem with the question. It doesn't ask the nebulously vague question "who is the most-connected seiyuu?", which would indeed be off-topic for being too broad/primarily opinion-based. Rather, it asks "who is the most-connected seiyuu in the 'six-degrees sense'?", which has a clear scope and a clear set of answerable criteria.

I think it's pretty clear from the question text that the asker is referring to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_BaconSix Degrees of Kevin Bacon, which has a clear set of criteria for calculating Bacon numbers:


  
  Kevin Bacon himself has a Bacon number of 0.
  Those actors who have worked directly with Kevin Bacon have a Bacon number of 1.
  If the lowest Bacon number of any actor with whom X has appeared in any movie is N, X's Bacon number is N+1. 
  


This is really just a movie industry-specific version of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_graphcollaboration graph. There are lots of similar numbers in other fields that are also well-known in the interwebs:


The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_numberErdős number, which describes the collaborative distance between mathematician Paul Erdős and another person, measured by authorship of mathematical papers.
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_numberErdős–Bacon number, which is the sum of someone's Erdős number and Bacon number.
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphy_numberMorphy number, which describes the minimum number of games that link someone to the chess player Paul Morphy.
The https://senseis.xmp.net/?ShusakuNumberShusaku number, which describes the minimum number of games that link someone to the Go player Shusaku.


Sure, the "six-degrees" metric may not necessarily be the most accurate indicator for how "connected" a seiyuu is for some reasonably meaningful meaning of "connected", but it's still a fun piece of trivia that's interesting to know and can be calculated.

In any case, there are lots of algorithms for calculating https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralitycentrality of a node in a graph, but since Bacon numbers are mentioned, a reasonable metric for centrality (as used by the http://oracleofbacon.org/onecenter.phpOracle of Bacon site) could just be to find the weighted average of the degree of separation of all the people who link to that particular person. And then just find the person with the lowest value. There, a clear and objectively determined answer!


  Kevin Bacon himself thinks this game was a joke


I don't think anyone takes Bacon numbers seriously. It's just for fun!


  The problem is that we are using a fundamentally speculative assumption to pose another about a similar topic. This will only create more misconception if the basis is not first scrutinized.


So I think you're saying that this may be an XY problem, and you're arguing that finding the best center in a collaboration graph is not a good indicator of how well-connected a seiyuu is. Hmm, maybe. But even if the resulting scores are completely meaningless, it's still trivia that people would be interested in knowing. What's the harm?


  However, if we count just people we know in any way (including social media) there can be an argument that many people have less than 6 degree today.


Well yes, but the question's not asking for that. It's just asking for the Bacon-style calculation metric, which only includes professional collaboration.


  The criteria is too broad.


I think any reasonable answerer can scope the answer just out of pragmatism, based on which databases are available. I think it'd be rather straightforward to throw together a script to crawl through all of the seiyuu entries in various databases (e.g. IMDB, AniDB, MAL, ANN, etc.), build the collaboration graph, and perform the necessary computations. (This may take a while because you don't want to run afoul of any rate limits.)

I came across the question a while ago and I actually already looked up some of the suggested answers on the Bacon site (which uses data from IMDB); it's just that there's no easy way to query the Bacon site for the actor with the lowest average number, so that's why I haven't posted an answer yet.

Here are some seiyuu that I've looked up so far on the Bacon site:


Average Kôichi Yamadera number: 3.624
Average Mamoru Miyano number: 3.675
Average Norio Wakamoto number: 3.751
Average Masako Nozawa number: 3.768
Average Hôchû Ôtsuka number: 3.797
Average Tomokazu Sugita number: 3.837
Average Keiji Fujiwara number: 4.008
Average Aoi Yûki number: 4.066
Average Nobuyo Ôyama number: 4.216
Average Kana Hanazawa number: 4.222


idk, it seems like a fun anime/graph theory crossover question, and I'd like to see it stay open.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/85439/discussion-on-answer-by-ahiijny-policy-revision-the-appropriateness-of-boardly).


















Okay, so the first thing I must admit is that I am a mathematical dunce so there are factors that may be beyond my comprehension. That may even be one of the problems with this question in this regard: Some of the necessary evidence is outside of our specific field of expertise.

However, insofar as what I can consider, I suspect that the problem is with additional unknown or otherwise incalculable factors which further complicate the question beyond your expectations.

First of all, this might not be a question that can be answered purely by mathematics. The volition of the females to be in a relationship with a particular somebody, let alone a polyamorous one, may be an incalculable factor. Asuna's willingness to be with Kirito is probably predicated on a presumption of chastity, or in other words his ability to be faithful to a monogamous relationship. Kirito's charisma is considered to be especially high, and in an abstracted question like this it is difficult to ignore that he is the protagonist of the story, which may increase his odds of success beyond that of the average extra. 

Second of all, how do you determine the average cross/gender encounter rate? If we assume that a woman has the same odds of being added to a harem at any given time, then odds of creating a heterosexual harem are zero percent if the player base is completely segregated for the entire duration of the game, and perhaps each time a person meets increases the likelihood that this person can be added to the harem. Now we know for a fact that it is not, but I suspect we still need to know how often people of opposite genders interacted within two years.

How many people constitute a harem? Can it be as few as three or five, or do there have to be at least a dozen women for it to count? You say at least five here, but it is not expressly stated in the question so it is left ambiguous for anybody viewing the question on the main site, and we base a question's open/closed status based upon the content of the question there.

Also, you should take note that your exemplary harem is impossible:


   Please remember that Sachi can not be in Kirito's harem because she dies before any of the other prospective members are introduced. We need to consider how the death rate affects the odds of being able to build a harem over the course of two years.


 Now some of these concerns can be hypothetically addressed if we know enough of the facts of the story, and a question that can be based in facts is usually not Primarily Opinion Based. Moreover, S.A.O. is the sort of story that divulges demographical information, so it is probably one of the better candidates for this type of question because they are more likely to exist in this tale and we are better suited to knowing those facts than a mathematician. In this regard, I am not sure if the question is exactly P.O.B., but I think these are the sorts of factors which may have been considered, and they certainly seems to be a very complicated one that would be difficult to answer.

More importantly, I have difficulty believing that the volition factor can be anything other than pure guesswork, which is probably adequate grounds enough for closure unless a study can be produced which demonstrates otherwise.

One incidental note I would like to add is that, working with assumed rates may solve the P.O.B. issue by giving us objective numbers to work with, but at the same time it would distance it from being an actual question regarding the show so much as the numbers derived from it, and risk putting it outside of our scope.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the realm of anime, the protagonist factor overcomes any unwillingness for females to be polyamorous.  There's a threshold for anyone to be polyamourous under certain conditions (money, fame, kids, etc). My main point here is that "opinion based" is a poor reason to close when math can be used.  Assumptions to these problems would make for good, fun,interesting answers, unlike the endless music identification requests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, I think the partial factorial takes into account females willingness to be polyamourous.  You go from `1 in 2501` to `1 in 2501*2500`, which is a bigly yuge difference.


















The novel and anime mentions rough numbers about how more than thousand (2,000) died in the first month before the first boss raid (see episode 2 of the anime). Your question make many assumptions on what people should know or should regard as fact without providing any specific citations beyond stating certain numbers. Questions of the legitimacy of tertiary sources aside. This whole assumption is a bit "What IF" scenario with little to no bearing on the series or franchise.

The author does not give any indications of gender distribution amongst the 10k users, we can make a generalized guess based on the number of characters that have appear, but outright generalizing is biased. Furthermore, Yui is not a player and can't be classified as one. Kayaba Akihiko is not one of the 10k players either as he just inserted himself into the game by digitizing himself (by remodeled FullDive machine to to transfer his consciousness into the virtual world, permanently, mentioned in epilogue/aftermath of the Ainclad Arc, with Rinko [Vol 4. Cp. 9]).

A harem builds itself by the whims of the author. You also forget that a harem does not have to be made up of a gender. Not all females will be interested in Kirito, despite his MC status. There are guys (Klein, for one) in Kirito's harem as well. Not all males won't be interested, for varying reasons. Without an acceptance criteria it's anyone's guess. As it stands as a question for this site, it's not a good fit. Maybe it would be for Code Golf or Puzzles. Claiming that is is based purely based in mathematics does not make it less opinionated. The math might not be but the context sure is.

This question is opinionated not unlike the if A and B fought who would win... The late Stan Lee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4_zFYnnn2Yanswers it well "The person who'd win in a fight is the person that the scriptwriter (i.e. author) wants to win." Making biased assumption to formulate the basis some sort of question isn't going to get us anywhere, except nitpick more are potential holes left by the author or writer. If we remove mentions of the series from the question it becomes a hypothetical statistical problem.

Adding math to an assumption does not may it any less of an assumption and just serves to skew public opinion of one's favor. Certain news outlets to it all the time to make ppl seem more favorable, while the information is technically true, the way it is presented is questionable.

tl;dr Because there as no acceptance criteria made and the assumptions were made with no regard towards actual canon ("every one know that..." is a very big generalization, and introduces a bit of cognitive bias [the question is leading]), with minimal use of citations from tertiary source. I am skeptical of the basis of the question, and regarded that it should be put on-hold is "generally opinionated". 

OP should take some time to review the basis of the question by make necessary citations and connecting the questions to be better align with the series or franchise itself instead of posing one that can be regard as a statistical math puzzle with an SAO skinned setting. 

Here is https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/how-is-misakas-railgun-so-destructivea question asking how Misaka's Railgun can be so destructive? The sort answer is, from a pure real-life (RL) physics standpoint it's not. But there maybe in-series canon cite that there is some underlining at play in their in-series universe. The question is generally acceptable because the context asked is regarded to be in series. RL examples can be provided to prove of disprove the series, mathematical models can help but is not generally required to answer. 

The mentioned question falls short of that as it is posed in the derived context of the OP's generalization (only females can be in be in a harem, all females are interested in becoming a port of the harem, the amount of female players [without subtext], who are considered players, the fact that Kirito would initiate such a scenario, etc).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We've tried [tag:anime-math] type questions before with very mixed results and very little initial response despite a large bounty being offered. Some very questionable assumptions were made in the math that ended up contradicting things and opening up holes in the physical basis of the world when compared to real life, perhaps due to incomplete planning or just laziness in fact checking.


















So I found this https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/22558/what-does-it-take-to-kill-a-ghoulquestion and edited its answer. However, it was only after I submitted a proposed edit that I noticed that the link given, specifically http://tokyoghoul.wikia.com/wiki/Ghoul#Weaknessthis link, points to a non-existent section of a wiki page. I checked it on waybackmachine and while the section existed as of the time the answer was posted, it was removed as of now. I've read the manga on that particular anime and I can say it's possible they removed it because some of the things stated were not confirmed. Reading further on the page, I noticed that they moved that particular section to a different one, providing citations while removing information that was not verified.

While someone familiar with an anime/manga can easily provide a better answer or just provide an updated link to the wiki page, I'd like to know how someone who is unfamiliar with a particular anime/manga should handle situations like these, especially if the sources are not wiki pages (pages from defunct websites that were not archived, online documents/paper that is not accessible anymore, etc.) Does this deserve a flag? And if it does, then I'd like to suggest an additional option in flagging, where the post can be flagged as an answer with out-of-date sources/non-existent sources/sources that cannot be verified. In addition, I'd also like to suggest a way for people to know that answers have out-of-date/non-existing sources (maybe a notice below answers stating that said-answer is already out-of-date or have sources that do not exist/never existed or a color aside from green, since I noticed this color is used for questions which already has an accepted answer, that would indicate that said post has out-of-date answers/accepted answers) so that people can easily identify them and can update the posted answer or provide a better one.

Anyway, this is just a suggestion. And, just to be clear, I'm not accusing the person who answered the question I posted as an example because clearly, it was not her/his fault to begin with (it was the wiki putting unverified information in the first place). Peace :) 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sources/Citations that do not exist anymore, are out of date or probably never existed in the first placeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As of the time after I posted this question, I already submitted a proposed edit with the updated link so it might already point to an updated part of the page but the original link points to a 'Weakness' section in the page, which was already removed. http://tokyoghoul.wikia.com/wiki/Ghoul#Weakness


















I'm pretty sure I'm one of the people who rejected your first edit (and if I didn't, I would have), so I'll give me two cents on it. While your goal may have been to maintain the author's original intent, you added enough new information that you could have just written a new post. Instead, you basically just grafted that new post into the current post through an edit.

My suggestion is that, in a case like this, you first comment on the post telling them where the new information is (in this case, new chapters) and suggesting that they add it. That way, you give the original author a way to add the information while ensuring that their original intent is maintained. Given that you seem to have basically gotten rid of one of the three non-quote paragraphs and wrote two paragraphs, it's hard to tell how well you maintained the original intent.

In regards to your other suggested edit, while fixing the spelling of the person's name is definitely helpful, one of the other edits you made was to change the post from being in entirely present tense to being partially in present tense and partially in past tense. I didn't reject this edit, but in my view that change is not helpful or even correct.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem I see with just adding comments is that the user who already posted the answer is already inactive. It was stated in the rules that an edit can be made to add additional information. No clear restrictions were given. I was also expecting that the reviewer knew well enough about the manga to know that the paragraph I erased contains outdated information. My question still stands: How did it deviate from the original intent when the intent was to give information regarding how humans become titans? (Continued below)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding the other edit, I don't see how changing it to past tense is a problem seeing as the events already happened in the manga. Regarding the first sentence, I forgot to change that to past tense too, but a reviewer can edit a proposed edit to correct this. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the use of past or present tenses a part of grammar? (Continued below)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re: the first one, you not only added a significant amount of additional information but also removed something like a third of the existing information. Whether or not it was outdated, that old information was the author's original intent. You could have just as easily made a new post that referenced the original post and given this new information without removing all of that information from the original post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'...that old information was the author's original intent.' I'm more confused than ever. When someone answers a question like: How did humans become titans?, the intent of the person answering should always be to show how humans become titans, and this was clear in that person's answer. So how does my intent deviate from the original author? I added information that, personally, does not need a new post seeing as the original person who answered already discussed most of them. This makes the question and answer thread more cleaner than repeating information already mentioned by another.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My interpretation of "original intent" is that it goes beyond just the intent of answering the question and goes into the specific answer that they intended to give. If we went just on your interpretation, edits could theoretically change an answer to anything as long as it apparently answered the question, even if it wasn't based on what the original author intended. A yes could be changed to a no because they're both intended to answer the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But seeing as I did not changed it from a 'yes' to a 'no', I still don't think the edit I made requires a separate post that says 'you see that other answer? that's outdated. Here's the updated information...' The post has only 1 possible answer. It is not a yes or no question nor a question that has multiple possible answers because there was only one explanation as to how humans became titans. Also, I thought that updating information is okay since it is mentioned in the guidelines for editing a post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@W.Are: even if there is one possible answer in the strictest sense, there may still be multiple ways to frame the problem. As with kuwaly, my interpretation is that intent is also an issue of the specific answer or perspective. The answers on [this Meta.SE post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/149706/261498) and [this Meta.SE answer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/146118/261498) kind of get at the logic behind it, I think.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Maroon Thanks for links! I read them and I seem to understand a bit about kuwaly's point. I'll keep this in mind. kuwaly, sorry if I seem rude or something. I'm just trying to clarify since I honestly was confused when you tried explaining your point :)

Just wanted to clarify something regarding images that are used to support answers. I am referring, in particular, to this answer here: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21994/what-happens-to-ichika-after-the-fated-summer-ends/50318#50318What happens to Ichika after the fated summer ends?

While the answer is in English, the image used contains dialogues that are not in English and, moreover, seems to be from a scanlation group.


Is including supporting images that are non-English to answers allowed? I am asking since it might be hard to verify whether or not the answer is accurate if the source is not in English. I am not suggesting that non-English sources should not be allowed because some users translate their answers taken from non-English websites while including the original, and since other users can see the original source, they can further verify whether or not the translation is accurate.
Is it alright to use images that are from scanlation groups? I am not arguing on the legality since I think this was already addressed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4043/freely-accessible-manga-anime-e-g-webcomic-online-anime-and-scanlation-fansuhere but rather on the accuracy of the translation from Japanese to whatever language it was translated to.

In these type of questions I would suggest we assume good faith as opposed to malicious intent. 

Up to this day, certain people still assume they can, by the means of training, obtain the ability to use a Kamehameha. So why couldn't they wonder about a kick that can break waves?

I've flagged https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/48918/what-holiday-is-miss-all-sunday-named-after/50940#50940this answer as 'low quality' because it has no sources and the way it is phrased, the author of said answer seems unsure of what he/she is saying.
Here's the full answer, which I'll try to breakdown and explain why I flagged it: 


  Well i thought in most counties they dont say weekend instead they say holiday and in japan i thought the week is six days long only sundays (holiday) is the day they get off hence Miss All Sunday (All Holiday)


Follow up comment of his/hers when asked to elaborate:


  I dont really know anything thing about other countries work week but i have only meet someone from napal and heard mention on a netflix from a (trevor noah) special



Well i thought in most counties they dont say weekend instead they say holiday... I don't know how it looks to other people but for me, this is an assumption without mentioning the basis. He/She assumed it immediately as true and concluded this might be the case, without presenting anything as support. If the sentence was phrased like 'I thought that this is the case because I read/saw in this particular reference that...' or something similar, it would not be so. 
in japan i thought the week is six days long only sundays (holiday) is the day they get off hence Miss All Sunday (All Holiday) Again, another assumption that 'Sunday' is called 'holiday'. Also, a week can never be 6 days, unless he/she is referring to the days where you work. 
I dont really know anything thing about other countries work week but i have only meet someone from napal and heard mention on a netflix from a (trevor noah) special This entirely contradicts his/her answer. He/She first mentions of what he/she knows about other countries' work week then later on admits he/she doesn't really know anything and that his/her basis is someone from Nepal (not from Japan, which is what is in the answer) and 'heard mention' from a Netflix show without mentioning the exact episode.
The https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/48918/what-holiday-is-miss-all-sunday-named-after/48933#48933previously accepted answer already confirms that this is not a holiday but rather, the mangaka himself stated that it refers to the happiest events, not necessarily holidays, of the year. The question is about One Piece and the mangaka himself answered the question. There is no better source to clear up misunderstandings or questions in the manga than the one who made it himself/herself.


Some might argue that the low quality flag can only be raised if the answer is not salvageable, and that it can still be edited. The formatting and grammar can be edited, yes, but the main idea of the answer was already contradicted, and by the mangaka himself. Isn't an answer that is already proven wrong by a reliable source (in this case, Oda) not salvageable anymore? I hope someone can enlighten me. Peace.

Note/Clarification: This is not an attempt to insult the one who answered the question or to the one who declined the flag. I am just trying to clear things up because this particular matter confuses me, that's all. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this really not a 'low quality' answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For context, [this](https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/low-quality-posts/49765) is the related LQ review: 5 recommended deletions, 2 looks okay → review invalidated by a mod (I think I skipped that review)


















As the one who handled your flag, let me clarify a bit as to why I rejected it.  

If I'm not comfortable outright deleting a post, I'm likely to decline the VLQ flag.
In this particular case, the OP was new and asked to improve their answer in the comments already. And should be given the chance to do so. Given that at the time of rejection, their comment (your point 3) was not yet present. 

I like the way https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93606/259147Jeff Atwood defined the VLQ


  VLQ means the flagger thinks this post is beyond saving -- no amount of editing or polishing will turn this particular turd into gold.  


Looking at the answer, I do not think it is beyond saving. As mentioned above, the OP had been requested in the comments to clarify their sources and reasoning. And given time, this could turn into a reasonable answer, all though possibly a wrong one.

As for the wrong answer part, I tend to follow https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/264294/259147Adam Lears reasoning


Wrong and unrelated? Delete
Wrong, as in bad ideas/practices? Downvote
Wrong, as in it doesn't answer/solve the question, but tries? Downvote


It does seem I fat-fingered the decline reason. As I originally meant to use the following: 


  flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies, or an altogether wrong answer 


Off course it is also worth to note, that if a OP is requested to update his answer, and this did not happen in a reasonable time (give or take 4 weeks). I would accept a custom flag mentioning something like the following: Op requested to update answer. Did not happen. Asking for deletion 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright, this clears things up. Thanks! I hope people don't think that I prefer only one correct answer. It's good to see counter-arguments and such in answers since it generates a good amount of discussion. I was just confused in this case that someone would present a different answer without even explaining or presenting their evidences. It just felt half-hearted to me and might not generate a good discussion or argument.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@W.Are This happens quite often with new users. And to at least be somewhat welcoming to them, we should give them a chance to improve. And this off course means that we should educate them. This often through the means of comments, and links to our help center/meta posts etc ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, noted :) Will try to be more thoughtful of the flags I raise in the future. I apologize if I seem rude or anything, by the way. Rest assured it was not my intention.


















Normally the solution is to create the required tag yourself. However, this is not possible without first having accumulated 300 reputation points. 

To get around this, simply tag your question with some relevant tag, or an even an irrelevant one, and leave a comment asking for the creation of a new tag, or ask in https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/maid-cafe-chat. Someone will come along and help you.

As another option, though I'm not sure if this is a good solution, the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag tag exists for this purpose, to serve as a placeholder until the proper tag is added, per its usage guidance:


  If you don't have permission to create a tag for an anime/manga that isn't already in the system, please use this tag and someone will create it for you. Be sure to state the name of the series in your question!

In late 2017 https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4125/49we were asked if a design for this site was being worked on or not, and at the time the design team was stretched pretty thin, to the point where I wasn't able to provide this community with a reasonable and realistic ETA for when they'd be able to work on it. 

But now I'm back with some good news! One of our newest designers, Lisa, has reached out to me saying that https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/351751/1328704the DAG team is starting to work on new site theme implementations again — and that Anime & Manga's on the top of the list! \o/

We know some of you https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4038/49were working on an unofficial site design, and we've also had idea collection posts https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/135/49back in 2012 and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2392/49again in 2015, but we're here to get some new feedback and ideas thrown around!

As other previous discussions noted, we're prolly gonna wanna stay clear of design ideas and concepts that put us into a niche-y kinda place, as we wanna try to make something that's "Anime & Manga" as a whole, and not just representative of a particular subgenre — so as much as some of you may love (for instance) Naruto, let's try to avoid shuriken :P 

So, yeah: leave your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions below as answers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Gathering ideas for the site design — 2019 edition!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel like "avoid shuriken" is just generally good advice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't forget what's available in [site themes changed](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/307862). IIRC [this image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHufi.png) lists everything up for change, except you can have custom badges too!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz Question titles on posts can't be colored, they're all black, as far as I'm aware. Minor difference. Also, the placement of the site logo/name can't be changed. It's fixed. The header banner can include either a pattern or solid color with an optional image/artwork but an image has to be narrow enough so that it won't interfere with the site logo at narrower widths (there are some exceptions, like on [movies.se] but that's specifically designed that way). Footer artwork is possible, too, as long as it doesn't impede legibility of the footer links.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For more general info, see my MSE post here: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/319274/responsive-design-themes-what-can-sites-customize-and-how-can-they-get-changes Feel free to ping me here or there if you have specific questions.


















Something simple and seasonal would be idea. One of the hallmarks of anime is it's seasonal nature. Many series are short-lived. But every season fans look forward to a new menu of anime programs, sometimes for the better or for the worse. A static layout that accents the seasons and changes by the season would be nice. 

Each season could outline a popular genre of anime and manga. The badges could be something that fit the season -- like a leaf for fall, droplet for spring, snowflake for winter, and a sun for summer.

One of the biggest challenges with making a banner about anime is being able to capture the essence of the subculture without using and specific IPs. Sure we can loosely imply parodies though commissions, the results will likely skew towards popular mainstream tastes. The anime and manga industry is the way it is through the diversity of talents of the content and tastes creators. 

While I initially proposed a os-tan style mascot/idol type poster character, I such a meme would be of any help to promote. This SE site. Character design guidelines, branding guidelines take too much time and effort. A simple picturesque seasonal vector landscape shot with the silhouette of a few more well known characters in the background might suffice.

Maybe it can be a bench at a trains station or storefront with anime and manga in the background (on a bill board or station sign billboard) a tree to on each side, or in the background. Make be something like a cross between:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/VPJwy.jpg

and/or

https://i.stack.imgur.com/rY3oI.jpg

But not with as much detail.

The scene:

One single location, as the seasons pass. The only real color palette, might be the primary/secondary color for a season plus the badge icons.

Nothing too tall or wide. Naturally with not as much detail. Shorter and narrower to keep up with the standard banner sizes.

The overall look and feel can be simple caricatures or veil/full silhouettes like these:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWdPd.jpg

https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDPEe.jpg

https://i.stack.imgur.com/vyAVY.jpg

Simple and flat looking, with layers like the above.

In general, something low-key yet recognizable by fans like this background:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/vMnbx.jpg

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ge3mS.jpg

https://i.stack.imgur.com/PBq2J.jpg

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fpc6n.jpg

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ewjUI.jpg

https://i.stack.imgur.com/IK91k.jpg

The Theme: 
Subtle, simple, yet picturesque.

If the concept of changing seasons is too complicated, then it's probably best to pick the ONE season you like best (I would summer or winter) and run with that. 

The meta site can be just the line art of the main site to accent a conceptual nature motif or something, like a behind the scenes making of banner.

Having it change throughout the year isn't going to happen. We've already got a immense backlog and I know you've been waiting forever... but that's a non-starter. It's got to be one design.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I mentioned at the very end, if it's too much effort just pick a season and commission an artist (as Jin mentioned before for RPG.SE) to do a small banner based on the color and examples as stylized motif. The examples provided are samples of a look and feel. Blue is fine, as a summer colors. Just not red like TV&M.SE. It's too harsh on the eyes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep. I saw that. My comment was for the benefit of others. For example, Makoto's answer draws on yours so I felt it was important to put it out there that "we can't do it, so please don't start making amazing plans around that idea that we just can't implement." :) I was pointing out the M&TV design for how it works, not because I think the palette is great for y'all. :) I'm an avid consumer of anime, for all that I haven't participated much here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's fine @Catija, your shooting down of this idea provided me with the inspiration I so sorely lacked during an inland blizzard-cyclone bomb whatever thing.  Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Going off the season idea, would spring (i.e. cherry blossom-season) be appropriate? Given its importance in Japan, that might be appropriate for a site about media originating fromt hat country.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Summer and winter have more of the big impact shows, while Japanese culture is related to anime and manga, it is not the topic of our site. Regardless on topic you are welcome to share your ideas in this meta as an answer. It might prove to be just the inspiration that is needed.


















Manga and anime as a whole...

That's tough. This is a very diverse subject.  To illustrate this point, my four favorite series are:


Outlaw Star (space punk, cyberpunk)
Cowboy Bebop (space)
Last Exile (fantasy, steampunk)
Samurai Champloo (fiction based in non-fiction, samurai/ninja/shogunate)


...and there aren't many similarities between those themes, except for maybe the https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanUpToTheSkyEndingpanning sky shots we get.

Instead of looking in-universe to tie these themes together, why not look outside of the universe to?

(I can't draw so please use your imagination.)

Let the setting be a manga cafe.  I haven't had an opportunity to set foot in one myself, but the idea here is that we want to capture all of the possibilities of Anime.  At the top we have what looks like a fairly rudimentary-looking cafe, with someone tending the shops and a handful of patrons looking at either anime or manga, but when you scroll down to the bottom, you see one or more people reading manga or watching anime evoking some or all of the different genres mentioned above.

Why a manga cafe?


It's not just one thing - cafes often support multiple formats and multiple different genres.
It gives us some liberty to illustrate to casual passers-by that this site is about all anime and manga, and not just the most popular handful out there.
It allows us to design our icons and look and feel off of a unified and common theme as opposed to picking some sub-genre of anime or manga itself.


Everyone likes something specific about anime and manga.  This design should reflect how inclusive we want to be of it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz:  I was thinking that could qualify as "artwork in the footer", honestly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz:  I'll be explicit then; I only ever intended the picture to show up at the bottom.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For footers with images, check [gaming.se], [workplace.se] and [movies.se] for examples.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure if what I'm proposing is *too* complex then @Catija; I was thinking along the dimensions of Worldbuilding along with something simple analogous to The Workplace.  Let me know if I need to rein it in, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Worldbuilding one is fine, too. I'm not the person actually doing the design, so I don't have much of a say, so (with some exceptions) feel free to dream big-ish and we'll see what she can do. :)


















We don't want to encourage people answering them, but at the same time we can some times empathize with their desire to find that thing they watched back then. Most of the time these questions are asked lazily. But on the rare occasion that the one asking actually put effort in provding, we don't want to have it go to waste, so we throw a bone to them as a consolation.

I would prefer not to have people answering in the comments, but we have no way of reasonably enforcing such a restriction besides out right locking the question. Such a response feels too heavy handed and burdensome to the moderation staff. Instead it may be better to leave it particularly at the discretion of the users. If the user really wants to help and has a good idea of what it is that can leave a comment, but also inform them that such questions are off topic. If they want to continue, they should move it to chat (need to give them write access if they are under 20 rep). The one asking should be given 24 hours to respond. If nothing is initiated within that time, the room may be frozen and deleted if it has been inactive for up to a week.

This gives to both those asking and answer some leeway while at the same time discouraging extended conversation in the comments grasping at straws. 

If you come upon two user fumbling about in such a manner in the comments you can just ask them to take it to chat, or flag it for a moderator to do so.

While we want to discourage Id requests we realize that many users are either unaware of if our internal policies or have little understanding of the way SE works. If you feel they deserve a hand based on their efforts, give them a hand. Otherwise vote to close or flag it as needed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the reply! I do understand why this would be a burden to moderators and to shift the hard work to them was not my intention at all. Saying that we users can have the discretion to help based on the willingness and the effort of the one who asked is, I think, enough and probably suffices as the answer to the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And since we now know what the moderators recommend as a course of action for this, I think this can be taken into account when deciding how to help the OP who asked an identification question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For what it's worth, I'd like to point out the [comment privilege guide](https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment) explicitly states to avoid posting answers in comments. It's pretty much a standard across all (if not most) SE sites, but I doubt very many people actually read the help guides :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Btw, I'm trying to grant someone under 20 rep write access but I can't seem to find his/her name when searching for it in the chat? This is his/her profile: https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/45441/silverman1212b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the've never been in chat, they don't have a chat profile. As them to is they want to join in a chatroom first. If they accept you can make one and send them the link to join. After they join, you can adde them. SE doesn't make chatting with new users conveient or easy sadly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Still can't add a user, even on granting write access. It still says 20 rep is needed even though the description says that low rep users can be given access. Or is it not possible to add a user who only has 1 rep?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which user are you looking to grant? A mod can grant them write access if you can't.


















I like кяαzєя's ideas and wanted to see what they'd look like in on an SE page, and so I edited the HTML and CSS. I now know how SE have done their site design. And I think it's pretty basic, but looks very nice. I focused on the navbar and the background, as picking colours is beyond me.


Navigation bar


The height is always 70px.
The width can be any size. (Images here have to support 4k and UW screen resolutions, and whatever the future has instore.)
It can be an opaque colour or image, or transparent.

Middle navigation bar


The height is always 70px.
The width is can be any size to a maximum 1264px.
The top-left is where the site logo and name are located.
The bottom-right is where a custom image can go. (https://meta.stackexchange.com/Meta and https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade)

Custom image


The height is at most 70px.
The width can be any size up to 1264px. (Arqade has this.)
You can have multiple images, but they all align with the bottom-right corner. (Arqade has 3 different ones here.)

Background


The height and width can be anything.
Most sites have repeating images or a solid colour.
It looks like you can get extravagant backgrounds, but these are repeating patterns. (https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/Worldbuilding)



Shop custom image and sky navigation

For the first image I:


Kept the background a solid colour.
Made the navigation bar an image.
Added the shop as a custom image.




https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptlEp.png

Bus stop custom image and sky background

For the second image I:


Made the background an image that fades into a solid colour.
Made the navigation bar transparent.
Added the bus stop as a custom image.




https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAnqi.png



If you want to mess around and see what you can come up with editing the page is really easy, and mostly comes down to changing the styles on three elements.

Changing the logo is the hardest part. Inspect the "Anime & Manga" element and add the following inside the <a> tag. (replace the icon with yours)

<img class="h-auto wmx100" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IY07y.png" alt="Anime & Manga">


After this you can replace the CSS styles. The following are what I used to get the above images:

// Store Front

.site-header {
  background-image: url(https://wallpapercave.com/wp/lhngQ0o.jpg);
}

.site-header .site-header--container {
  background-image: url("https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZrMD.png");
  background-size: 180px 64px;
}

// Bus stop

body {
  background-color: #09515D;
  background-image: url("https://i.stack.imgur.com/wM5xg.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 0 50px;
}

.site-header {
  background-color: transparent;
}

.site-header .site-header--container {
  background-image: url("https://i.stack.imgur.com/9jS3B.png");
  background-size: 252px 64px;
}

As for the object of this process, since we certainly don't want to infringe copyright, and since I missed https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/426/2516What should our "unofficial" community name and logo or mascot be?, I just wanted to propose a mascot ala https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_anthropomorphismOS-tan as Stack-ko (スタッこ, sutakko), comprising of Stack (as in, "Stack Exchange"), and ko (子/娘, child/daughter)... but any other idea is welcomed...

Given how diverse and broad Anime and Manga are, picking a single entity (a-la OS-tan) to represent it doesn't quite feel as nice to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto fair point. If there's any better idea for the object of the scene that generic enough to capture the essence of anime & manga, then I really welcome it. On the other hand, I prefer *not* to represent particular series like the one on Movie.SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka: I've cleaned up my answer to this question to make it less of a ramble and more of a coherent suggestion; I welcome your perusal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka For what it's worth, Movies & TV's header already has Goku as one of its images, so one of the iconic anime characters is already there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Thunderforge:  I'd argue that's a sub-genre of TV chosen explicitly to represent Anime as a whole.  There's no one character in all of Anime which would be suitable to represent Anime, since not *everyone* likes Shonen-style anime.


















This came to mind after seeing this question: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/8836/why-is-ulquiorra-the-only-espada-with-a-second-releaseWhy is Ulquiorra the only espada with a second release?

While I have no problem with speculations as answers, since I sometimes give them, I agree with what a post discussed that https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4019/what-do-we-do-with-questions-presented-as-hypothetical-but-with-real-answerseven speculations require support via facts or any information that is canon. Topics regarding references have been asked before, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/292/should-wiki-references-be-allowedhere and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/191/should-we-ask-answerers-to-give-a-referencehere, to name a few. However, I'm not sure if I can agree to what was said in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/292/should-wiki-references-be-allowedhere. To quote: 


  There's nothing wrong with referencing any source you may find, and think that is credible. Whether you, the OP, accepts it as one, is your business.


If I understand correctly, this would mean that any source is valid as long as the OP and the one who answered think it is credible. While the question might be asked for the OP's benefit, the problem is that the post is public. People come to the site seeking information, and the site is a Q&A site relying on facts which differs from other sites. There could be a spread of misinformation if one just uses any references he/she can get a hand on as long as he/she 'thinks' it is valid.

The question regarding Ulquiorra was answered using information from a Tumblr and Yahoo! Answers post, which also only state speculations without information referenced/cited from canon to substantiate the claims. Despite this, it was accepted by the OP.

So, what sources/references should we consider as valid/acceptable? Or do we only give the discretion to the OP and the 'answerers' as long as they include a reference, as stated in the meta post cited above, and as long as the OP thinks it helped him/her?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What sources/references should we consider as valid/acceptable?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Simply put, perferably primary or secondary sources... Tertiary sources are ok but not reliable, most people use it because they are lazy (we operate on the principle of anything is better than nothing due to this). Yahoo Answers-type posts should be backed up with additional sources.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding [accepted answer](https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/accepted-answer), it's OP's privilege to choose which answer helps *them* the best. Not necessarily the correct answer though. On subjective/speculative questions, whether it means OP's believing the answer is "the most correct", we can't really prevent them.


















I think having the badges as a cherry blossom leaf would be inclusive to most anime/manga. (Not too sure how they'd look in bronze, silver and gold)



Here's https://www.fandom.com/articles/cherry-blossoms-significant-animean article that lists quite a few animes that have them. I've seen them in various animes and mangas ranging from Shōnen (Byakuya Kuchiki - Bleach & Kirsch Vermillion - Black Clover), Shōjo and Seinen (Elfhelm - Bezerk).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!Yu-Gi-Oh! is a media franchise primarily consisting of manga and anime (along with a trading card game). Over the last 20+ years, it's spawned seven different anime series (two of which are different adaptations of the same manga series). 

Naturally, this site has the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-ohyu-gi-oh, but it seems to cover all 7 series. Looking at them, they are about:


Original series: 19
GX: 2
5D's: 2
VRAINS: 1
Original series and GX: 1
Original series and Zexal: 1
Arc-V and VRAINS: 1
Kazuki Takahashi (series creator): 2
Franchise as a whole/Unspecified: 4


Some of them are about the manga specifically, others are about the anime specifically, and some of them are open to answers for either.

What is the best way to tag these? Do we just want a tag for each series (covering both the manga and anime) along with https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-seriesyu-gi-oh-series and call it a day? Or does another tagging system make sense?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkdcQgNJHoIt's time to t-t-t-t-t-t-t-tag!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we tag the Yu-Gi-Oh! series?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, I think a single tag for Yu-Gi-Oh!, and other anime/manga, would suffice. Much cleaner. Less hassle when retagging.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@W.Are My concern is that the different series have little to nothing in common with them aside from the fact that they play the same card game. It's more like Kamen Rider or Super Sentai in that they have different characters and sometimes different rules to their universe, but all have the same conceit (and occasionally cross over).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay but the fact remains that the franchise is related to a particular card game with a particular deck, different from other card games like Cardfight Vanguard, if I recall correctly, regardless if the plot or characters between each series are never connected. Maybe if it has more questions then separate tags might be necessary for each series but as it stands, it has around 32 questions so far and anyone looking for info or questions won't have a hard time finding them. But I'm not a mod so the final say is from them. Just expressing what I thought.


















Due to the current lack of popularity with the series. It's no necessary a priority, but breaking up the series into tags would be helpful as they are pretty distinct from one another.

GX, 5D's, Zexals, Arc-V, V-Rains, etc. are distinctly spin-offs (Like Railgun is to Index) of the original series (even if they share the same universe and timeline) and should not be grouped with the "original" series.

Ideally we can do something like this:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-seriesyu-gi-oh-series General franchise tag

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-mangayu-gi-oh-manga Inclusive of the original manga and the R series (even if it's canonicity is in question)

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-moviesyu-gi-oh-movies All the movies including the 1999 Toei movie.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-novelsyu-gi-oh-novels For the novel stuff that didn't really come out here (not a big thing compared to Japan).

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-ohyu-gi-oh the "original" anime series including the 1998 Toei series, Duel Monsters series by Gallop (including the Capsule Monsters part that was not released in Japan).

Spinoff series such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-gxyu-gi-oh-gx, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-5dsyu-gi-oh-5ds, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-zexalsyu-gi-oh-zexals, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-arc-vyu-gi-oh-arc-v,https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-v-rainsyu-gi-oh-v-rains, should be tagged as appropriate, and future titles should use the [yu-gi-oh + series-name + ] as applicable within the bounds of the maximum length and formatting of SE tags. 

Avoid redundant tagging where applicable. If you want to compare the original series and a spin off , jus use the two series tags sand don't include the franchise tags unless it's there is some relation of the entire franchise itself, like "Why is the canonicity of Yu-Gi-Oh! R disputed, despite being being set in the same universe and supervised by the original series creator?" would have https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-mangayu-gi-oh-manga and https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-oh-seriesyu-gi-oh-series. Maybe a tag for the creator himself. No need to use the https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/yu-gi-ohyu-gi-oh tag.

I recently posted a question on this site regarding pages order for an anime magazine I am working on and surprisingly some people found it off-topic.

I'm really curious to know if it really is, because I always viewed StackExchange as an integrated site and that you will always find a community to ask any descent question you may have.
So if this community isn't the place for such a question, is there any other?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions regarding creating an anime magazine off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: [Are questions about how to make anime and manga off-topic?](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/6/2516)


















Stack Exchange is not as "integrated" as you may think (especially not this one). On the topic of your question, while tangentially about anime, is more so about content creation. Most of this community is unable to help with your question due to their lack of expertise in the matter. Unfortunately there is not really a venue that can assist you with this. We're Q&A site on a recreational topic, unlike some of our cooler, more professional cousins.

There is a lot that goes on and needs to be considered when creating and organizing content for a magazine, regardless of whether it's a professional or amateur endeavor. You need to consider things like target audience (and how appropriate the content is for who you target), cost of production, method of distribution, deadlines for content, illustrations and other media, not just how things should be ordered (typically magazine put things they know ppl want to see in the center, strategically placing color content can also help draw attention, how to manage it varies heavily on what and how you want to present your content). 

That is why I made the suggestion to steer your question more so to resource collection of anime and manga periodical publication as a reference point to base your content creation effort. No topic is off-topic in our main chatroom, so I suggested you stop by for a bit of casual discussion.

Content creation is a very tricky subject to tackle like making your own anime or manga. There's a technical side as well as a creative side. We used to refer users to Design.SE, but such questions were not well received due to the very niche nature and perception of anime and manga with more "mainstream" crowds. So we try to redirect things to chat to at least try to help or point people in the right direction instead of saying look elsewhere. I can't speak for other communities, but we may not be able to offer much expert advice as professional, due to our lack of technical expertise, but we can at least try to some share our anecdotal experience and opinions are consumers of anime and manga subculture and media. 

While what is offer might be meager in the grand scale of things, what's left of us will at least try to steer you in the right direction if we can help directly. What matters is context, you tell us what you need and we'll tell you where we might be able to give you a hand.

I'm not sure if this can be asked but since https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1009/downvoting-shouldnt-people-comment-why-they-downvotedthis discussion mentions that multiple downvotes with no explanation can be consulted on meta, I decided to just ask.

Anyway, I just noticed that I've been getting a downvote on most of my recent answers. I would more than understand if these downvotes were given to my older answers as I might not be as knowledgeable about certain topics before as I am now. However, these are the answers that have been downvoted:


https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51516/how-does-s-class-heroes-power-compare-to-threat-levels/51539#51539How does S-Class heroes' power compare to threat levels?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51480/who-are-the-heroes-that-sweet-mask-acknowledged/51488#51488Who are the Heroes that Sweet Mask acknowledged?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51437/why-does-iida-call-ochako-uraraka-kun/51438#51438Why does Iida call Ochako Uraraka-Kun?
https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51351/when-is-naruto-using-kurama-one-tail/51352#51352When is Naruto using Kurama one tail


If there's anything common among these answers, it's that they were recently given and are not without sources so they are easily verified. There is little speculation, if not none, that is needed as these questions can be answered with facts either from the manga or from other sources which made me wonder what could be the reason for the downvotes. If you think they need improvement or there's anything else wrong with it, it would be greatly appreciated if someone can enlighten me. I am always open to suggestions since I know I can always learn from them.

I'm not really worried about downvotes, as it is a user's right. What I'm worried about is that it is being used for something else. I am not 100% sure but I'm 99% sure this is just one user and I think I know who this user that's been giving me downvotes recently. My suspicion as to why is that I've been recently stating in my answers that it has verifiable sources as I've noticed recent answers with no sources on new questions in the main site.

It would be greatly appreciated if that user would just confront me directly and tell me what his/her problem with me is (whether on chat or here) instead of resorting to downvotes just because he/she don't like being given a suggestion on answers or that a sourced answer was preferred over his/her. If I'm wrong and I'm just paranoid, then I sincerely apologize to whoever he/she is that I suspected.

What do you guys think? Am I just being paranoid and should leave this be? I'm just worried other users would be deterred from staying on this site because of downvotes being used as some sort of retaliation or something else.

Update 1: As of typing this update, two more downvotes, likely from the same user, on the following answers happened: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51380/which-volume-has-mikasas-backstory/51382#51382Which volume has Mikasa's backstory? https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/51474/is-kings-luck-natural-or-does-he-have-some-sort-of-luck-superpower/51477#51477Is King's luck natural or does he have some sort of "luck superpower"? 

Update 2: Points were returned. Thanks to the admins/moderators! User still has not made any attempt to contact or give any reason for what happpened. Hoping this will be the last time this would happen to anyone else. 

Note: I am not trying to provoke anyone here, just wanted to have some peace of mind.

And so would have just ignored them. Maybe some people think that it's worthy of downvotes instead. I've suggested a couple of edits to improve this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz Thanks for the suggestion! I've seen your suggested edits ad no offense but I'm not sure since you just changed the formatting and some grammatical mistakes were made in the suggestion. I've made sure they are of correct grammar and I've arranged my thoughts in order not to confuse others. By 'hard to read' what do you mean exactly? Can you clarify? I find it a bit vague.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@W.Are I mostly changed the format/arrangement. I'm interested in what grammatical errors I introduced. I like OPM, but reading your answers were a chore to me - so it was hard to read.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Still cannot understand why you think 'reading your answers were a chore - so it was hard to read' :) Did I incur grammatical mistakes? Was there a lack/too much information? Did I miss some information? Was the flow of my discussion hard to follow? If you want, I can explain to you why my flow of discussion was like that and why the edit deviates to what I want to impart with my answer...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You have a lot of unneeded information, "Here's a sourced answer for you" is just noise. A lot of the second link is noise like this. This noise can be removed by using correct formatting. I found the first hard to read because it doesn't answer the question until halfway through. And the added information (that I moved to the bottom) is IMO useless trivia. The second answer is poorly formatted with a lot of noise that makes it hard to see if they only acknowledge S-class heroes. I changed it so that you can see the heroes, ranks and sources in a couple of seconds. Rather than minutes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz The purpose of my statement about a sourced answer is, for me, not noise. As I've said in my post above, I recently noticed questions without any sources at all. It was meant as a way for the OP to easily identify it as a sourced answer so that even among the multiple unsourced answer given, he/she can determine which is which since this site requires sources. I know it may not be needed at all times but seeing the recent wave of unsourced answers, I felt it was necessary. b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the first answer, I usually do this on my answers. Discuss a bit about the topic before giving your answers. This is for the benefit of the asker to which the answer is directed to in case that particular information is not clear. If you think this is useless, you can just skip over it while reading. Seeing as it was marked as answered by the OP and there were no clarifications asked, it seems to me that he/she understood the answer just fine. b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the second answer, I think it is an overstatement to say that it would take you minutes to read. It has less than ten, short sentences, each hero acknowledged separated by a paragraph while the last paragraph acts as the conclusion. Again, regarding the statement that it is sourced, I felt it was necessary as a previous answer gave a lot of unsourced information. This is to help the OP identify which answer has sources and which has not, given the recent answers from different questions without sources.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz Although I do admit that now that you mentioned it, the statement 'here's a sourced answer...' does seem like noise or even unnecessary. I'll try to avoid them in the future, thanks! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"you can just skip over it while reading" is hard to do when your answer has no formatting, guiding me where I can skip to without skipping too much. I've never said that your answers are not understandable or lack information, I've only said that they have unneeded noise and are poorly formatted. I don't think it's an overstatement as it did take me a couple of minutes to read.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz Alright. I meant no offense whatsoever in my earlier comments. I'll take this into mind in the future when giving other answers. Thanks! :) I appreciate it. I just hope that the user who downvoted my answers explain what he/she saw wrong like you did so that I can better understand, instead of resorting to unreasonable downvotes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Woah! I've only just got the move this discussion to chat message :O No offense taken, feel free to decline my suggested edits if you don't think they're good. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz Nah, I'll accept them since you raised a good point :)


















Ok, this is my personal opinion, I always thought a spoiler tag in a Q&A board about stories doesnt make sense. Why? Because anything it's a spoiler for someone who hasnt seen a segment of a story yet. Then, when to use a spoiler tag becomes completely arbitrary. But, in the case they should be use, I think there should be practical rules. Which these practical rules should be I truly don't know (since I think spoilers tags dont make sense in a Q&A board) . For example, if you want to use it for manga content (because manga it's released first than anime, and it contains spoilers) many if not most manga questions should be tagged, which again, in my opinion, it doesnt make sense because it adds you a barrier for people to make questions, but it could have some logic I suppose. Another example, use the tag when a movie is relatively new. This forbiddes you to make you certain questions which should have the spoiler in the title. For example, let's suppose a new Dragon Ball movie has a new transformation and I want to make a question about it. The very question itself would be a spoiler in this sense. This even becomes less reasonable when promotional material made by the authors include the spoiler, some people argues they don't want to see.

So, is there any practical rule for the spoilers tag? Should they be used? If there is a practical rule, shouldnt it be in the FAQ of the anime SE website?

Generally speaking, the best way to have someone look into this is to either flag one of the downvoted posts so the moderation team can investigate the issue, or use https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/contactthe contact form to have someone from the Support Team look at it.

I'll also add that a lot of times the system automatically invalidates these votes, especially if they're cast over a short period of time.

Some quick notes based on the feedback provided here and in chat:

On the original feedback gathering post https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4229/gathering-ideas-for-the-site-design-2019-edition#comment8591_4229Catija left a really relevant link that I failed to put in a more conspicuous location, which coulda helped in managing expectations for this — I'm sorry about that, really! The comments links to https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/319274/208518this MSE post, in which it's made clear that future site designs are not gonna have the level of detail that sites like Worldbuilding have, but instead more in the lines of the Blender, Travel, or Puzzling sites' designs. Having said that: this design actually probably has way more elements than any of the upcoming site designs will.

It's obvious not everyone will be happy with what we come up with, but given the feedback we gathered in the idea gathering post and the constraints the above puts in place, I feel like our designer did a good job trying to incorporate most of the thoughts y'all put into that post: the design is simple, yes, but its atmosphere feels anime-esque to me. Again, not everyone will be happy, but if there are small tweaks that could make it look better,  they're welcome, and we'll try to incorporate 'em into the final design!

And if you have any questions, feel free to ask 'em too :)



Earlier last month, we collected some new https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4229/49ideas for the site design. You suggested that the design be simple, picturesque, and representative of the anime and manga culture. 

It's been a long time coming and I’m excited to share what the design team came up with for our community! \o/ You can see it live in the site now (along with updated reputation thresholds), but here are some screenshots too:

As it was brought up in the previous meta post, our designer also created a variation of the community https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/459/49logo with the original sources of inspiration in mind.

We know, again, that coming up with a design that represents the Anime & Manga community as a whole is not an easy task, but we hope this design is reflective of the community without focusing on any specific niches. 

We hope that you love the design we build in this phase but we expect some minor adjustments may be necessary. So you have have any feedback, please let us know.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anime & Manga Site Designb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's certainly better than the beta theme, but honestly it doesn't really seem to represent anime. It looks more like a theme for a site about public transportation. Looking through the [2019 site theme ideas](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4229/43313) thread, I can't see any of those being implemented. I see a flat theme with some clouds and a bus. I guess public transport is important in Japan, but so what? I don't see it as being **reflective of the community** at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Associated chat thread:  https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50118946#50118946b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can I express to you, "I'm not a fan of this design and I wish it had incorporated other elements from other suggestions?" - not unlike what @forest is getting at - in a way which would be constructive and actionable?  I've been snake bit today by the feedback loop on Stack Exchange, and I have _no_ real way to rectify this.  I want to provide my feedback but I have no idea how to express it in a constructive way to you.  Can you help me out?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I'm really curious is why green is picked for an anime site? Wouldn't something pink or red be better?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In all honesty, @Makoto, the bit of text you put between quotes, in and of itself, is pretty valid and reasonable feedback.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd have to agree with Makoto as well. Beyond that I feel like the design is a tad blend, and not really representative of A&M, but more obscurely hinting to Japanese culture instead. For the header part of things, I think that adding in some life, or iconography beyond a single bus stop in the top bar could help. Potentially taking inspiration from movies.SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The references that here are not easily grasped by the average user. Many might not realize this, but the big round thing on the bottom is the [nuclear explosion](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FSeV.jpg) from the Akira movie. Green color is likely a representation of the nuclear fallout emitted by the explosion. The stationary bus here has a front view seat of the impending shockwave. The train stop turned bus stop up top is a clear symbolism of the queue to enter the cycle of reincarnations those bus riders that have yet to meet their fate. (none of this is true or relevant)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This depiction is highly representative of the chaotic and symbolic nature of anime and manga. You guys need to watch more anime and read more manga to understand to appreciate the hidden aspects of this anime-esque design. It's all there you just have to use your imagination to see it. (none of this is true or relevant)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry @кяαzєя, I find your response unacceptable.  I am too young to have really seen or appreciated Akira, so the reference doesn't do anything for me at all.  This is not only why [I underscored the difficulty](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4231/102) of looking in-universe for references or common themes, but it also brings to light [my biggest concern](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4229/gathering-ideas-for-the-site-design-2019-edition/4231#comment8612_4235) of using a *single* entity to represent all of Anime.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The bus should be moved one bus length to the right and placed underneath the text "Blog  Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn", currently it makes the page longer than necessary. Perhaps a CSS tweak. On a different note, I have some agreement with Makato, using a single entity (a bus / bomb) to represent Anime leaves much to be desired.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto the statements I made are completely untrue and unrelated to anything and is intended to satirize the far-reaching claim, intended to sollicit a specific response. A train stop turned into a bus stop and a bus in front of a random backdrop does not resonate "anime" or "manga" to many people. What's representative of anime is not the works themselves but the connection these works have with the people the enjoy them. Without this, it's meaningless shapes and colors without any meaning or context. My thoughts about the design is commensurate to how you feel about my response.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@кяαzєя:  Yeah, I'm gonna own that.  I've been in a different mental space the last few days so I couldn't even see the biting satire here.  My apologies. :)

Badges
It would be nice to use a cherry blossom petal instead of a peach blossom. As the cherry blossom is most synonymous with spring overall, which I assume is the theme by the header.

Petals from right to left: Plum, peach, cherry.

A turnip? an onion?... oh, I see, it must be a petal.' [vaguely remembering some meta post suggesting that]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The petal is the same as the one at the center of the logo. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The request is to change it from peach to cherry... in the original concept it was a cherry petal as well. Clovers have four petals.

Both the logo and badges would change to depict a cherry blossom petal (featuring a notch).


















Remove the bus shelter at the top and the bus at the bottom.  While it's apparently too late to come up with a design that would actually represent anime and manga, removing these elements would be a significant improvement.  As it stands, the current design can only confuse the visitors as to the purpose of the site.

I can't say I've watched a huge amount of anime, but I like to think I've watched a broad range of it.  From the 70's to the present, across various genres and target audiences, I don't see this "public transportation" theme representative of the anime I've seen or heard of, either broadly or narrowly. A generic transit bus that could be seen anywhere in a the world. A bus shelter that maybe kinda looks like a broken tori gate if you squint your eyes but wouldn't look out place in North America or Europe. Even limiting yourself to public transportation you can find better things to represent Japan, if not anime and manga.

As a result, I can't see why anyone would think these bus elements represent anime and/or manga. It doesn't help that you just simply asserted that the design "feels anime-esque" to you, without explaining why. Absent any reason to believe otherwise, I think these elements would only suggest something different to people visiting the site and so should be removed to prevent confusion. While the resulting, simpler, design wouldn't be any more anime-esque than it is now, it a least won't be giving the impression the site is supposed to be about public transportation.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I meant the _atmosphere_ feels anime-esque. Not the bus or the stop in and of themselves. Also not suggesting "public transportation" equates anime either.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Conversely, I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with choosing sky/clouds/bus/train stop as a theme (things that immediately came to mind were: the train scene in *Spirited Away*, the bus scene in *Madoka Magica: Rebellion*, the first chapter of *Mieruko-chan*, [Yukko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6a_lcao6rw)...) I think it could work, it just needs more tweaks so that it looks more "obviously anime/manga" rather than "generic public transportation".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with your assessment, but disagree with your solution. I think it is possible to make the community _like and want_ the bus stop and bus. If you want you can run the following to get the result you want. `[$('.site-header--container'),$('.site-footer')].map(i => i.css({'background-image': 'unset'}));`


















Firstly it looks like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4234my suggestion, https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50121764#50121764may have heavily influenced the outcome. Sorry everyone :(

tl;dr:


The colour pallet, bus stop and bus are cool.
Only having bus and nature as the theme makes this look like a design for Travel.SE.
Having a hyper-realistic clouds, flat design and a travel theme knocks the anime aspects down a couple of pegs.

Whilst these by-themselves in an anime theme would work, having the entire theme be somewhat tangentially related makes it look like it's not an anime theme.
The clouds look like CGI not anime.


Something similar has been said in chat. https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50123705#50123705[1]



Pros:


Despite what some others say, I really like the the bus stop. (I may be biased) And some people have said it has a Monogatari feel.https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50120860#50120860[1] https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50123918#50123918[2]

IMO, except a little contrast issue, it https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gVmx.pngperfectly fits my second design.
I think the lime/green background is quite nice, and reminds me of https://i.stack.imgur.com/PBq2J.jpgthis suggestion.

IMO it'd be cool if there were chunks/segments in the gradient, like the linked image. However it doesn't look like you can do that with radial-gradient. :(


Neutral:


I think having a bus and a bus stop is pretty cool. However, if the bus wasn't there I wouldn't mind. I also don't get a 'that's cool' vibe from it alone.

However, given that the core of our theme seems to be a bus driving into the sunset, it seems more like a theme that is intended for https://travel.stackexchange.com/Travel.SE, or more specifically 'Bus Travel.SE'.


Cons:


This is related to https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4247a previous answer, they're too blurry. To me they look like clouds that were designed to be a quarter, or smaller, than the size they're meant to be and so were blown up and had the blur turned to 80% to remove the pixelated edges.

I also don't like how they look 'hyper-realistic'. This may be because inspiration was taken from these pictures: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vMnbx.jpg1, https://i.stack.imgur.com/ge3mS.jpg2 or https://i.stack.imgur.com/IK91k.jpg3.

I like the style of cloud shown in https://i.stack.imgur.com/PBq2J.jpg1 and https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAnqi.png2 the most. However whilst I don't like the artistic styling as much, I think the clouds in https://i.stack.imgur.com/VPJwy.jpg1, https://i.stack.imgur.com/rY3oI.jpg2, https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fpc6n.jpg3 and https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptlEp.png4 also exhibit an anime style.
The sun at the bottom of the screen does nothing for me.


It kinda explains why there's a gradient from green to lime in the center of the page.
To me a sunset is orange and red, and so makes me question the colour pallet.
I don't think an orange/red colour pallet would look nice for a background.
Is this an obscure reference to the flag of Japan?
Since the sun and the bus are in the same image I can't see what it would look like without the sun, so can't say if it makes the bottom of the page not look barren. (Which would turn this into a neutral/pro)





What do I think would fix this?


Animeify the clouds.
They're going to be seen by 100% of people that visit the site, are part of the first thing most people will see and are the largest, size wise, part of the design.

If they don't scream anime, then the first impression won't be that this is an anime site.
Add some people.


  They more often use a X amount of characters across the page to visualise it
  - Dimitri mx in https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50123946#50123946chat


Whilst this was suggested in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4235this answer, there seems to be a lot of conflict over this idea.


It seems like people want to have the characters based on ones they like from animes. And so could lead to licensing issues.
People want diversity.

I have a bit of a problem with this argument, as there's only a finite amount of characters we can have, but an infinite variate of characters. So some are going to be missed.



Overall to me it seems making at least two generic anime characters would fix this.

From here you can do cool stuff like have them waiting in the bus-stop, and then have them in the bus.

If resources were infinite you could also do:


  Maybe a girl chasing the bus with toast in her mouth. :P

To clarify, what I'm describing is a discussion where the question is about a series' soundtracks and the answer would list the soundtracks used, the approximate time it occurs and a brief description of the scene when it occurs per episode. 

I was planning on doing this on short series, for a start, so that others would simply have to look for one question, and see if the soundtrack they are looking for is already known or not. 

Would this be alright? Will it not count as a duplicate question if some soundtracks were already answered before? Or should questions about soundtracks be separate questions only? 

If it's okay to do this, would it be better off as a community wiki rather than a regular question and answer? 

Edit: As requested, below is an example of what the answer might look like:

I confess - I have failed you.

No matter how many times I tried to come to this post and actually put together some reasonably scoped (i.e. "tweakable") criticism about this theme, my tendency to conflate this with some existing Stack Exchange-level communication breakdown keeps getting in the way.

So, I'll repeat what I said in the comment I left on this post and hope that this actually keeps me on the straight-and-narrow.  No promises though; I'm not on a tightrope.


  I'm not a fan of this design and I wish it had incorporated other elements from other suggestions.


By that, I mean:


Something recognizable about Anime or Manga should be in the theme.  In my mind, a Japanese bus stop and a Japanese bus are more artifacts of the culture.  Left-side drive nations have buses which can look similar to this, so I don't find this to be particularly striking.
The color scheme is unique and calming, but...there's nothing to tie it together to anything specific to either Anime or Manga.  Maybe the color was meant to evoke a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchamatcha, but that's a Japanese culture thing, and not an anime/manga culture thing.
I'm not left with a sense of wonder.  I'm left with a sense of bewilderment.  To try to mitigate my unconscious and conscious biases, I showed the site to a few friends of mine whom I trust with UI/UX opinions, and they didn't really see the "anime" in it.  Admittedly they have their own biases about anime in general which I won't repeat here, but the consensus was fairly universal - didn't seem like enough.


...but none of that can be taken back to a designer to "fix", because the end result is "change it", which isn't the kind of feedback I wanted to give, nor is the kind of feedback that gets attention.  It's basically me just saying, "I don't really like it and I want it all changed," which is hardly a good way to get constructive criticism going here.

But in an effort to remain as optimistic as I normally am once was, I decided to look around at prior art to regain some positivity and look at this from a different perspective.  I wanted to see what the feedback loop has been in the past for sites who have changed who weren't the larger, more prominently themed sites.

...

I'm making a conscious observation about the feedback loop we've got going on here.  Just https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/319274/responsive-design-themes-what-can-sites-customize-and-how-can-they-get-changesreferencing the Meta post that was meant to be more obvious, the two main sites mentioned who stated that there was some kind of deficiency in their layout have had radio silence on their feedback, even if it's been prominently stated or displayed as something that's looked at or into.

https://dba.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3077/suggestions-for-a-better-headline-graphicDBA.se hasn't had an official response to it since it was created.

https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12110/what-should-the-new-background-theme-look-likeSciFi.se received one comment on one answer in regards to constructive criticism towards a suggestion for improvement.  Beyond that...nothing really concrete in the lines of what I would want to see as "progress" since it was created.

There's also a discrepancy here.  At least it seems that SciFi https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12073/science-fiction-fantasys-updated-site-theme-is-ready-for-testing/12093#12093had a chance to trial the theme out before it went live.  Had we had the chance to do that there, I think there wouldn't be quite as much angst with it.  Kinda feels like this is what we're getting and we can tweak it slightly from here, and the team is then "off to the next one".

To hammer home the point of the reason why this matters at all:

This site is tiny.  A theming change will either entice or repel people from our community.  An unsuitable theme won't entice anyone to stay around.

We want to be putting the best foot forward, and I don't think we are right now.

But again, I've failed to put this in terms which I feel like are actionable.  Sorry.

I don't think there's such a thing as an 'anime colour scheme', as anything can use the same colour scheme and make it 'not anime'.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz:  What characters would be suitable?  I believe this to be rhetorical since I'm not convinced that there could be enough representation from the diversity in the genres.  Additionally, my remark on the color wasn't that it was "bad" - it's calming, which is a positive thing - but the color by itself isn't tied to any central theme *of* anime or manga.  *Perhaps* if it were the same shade as a manga itself, that'd probably be okay.  Kind of wish I could go back in time to scope my response accordingly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have said which characters [in my answer](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4256). Yes I understand you, but I don't think there exists a colour scheme which is undeniably a "central theme of anime or manga". If you look at my answer you'll see that I have said that it looks like one of the supplied anime image's colour scheme.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*At least it seems that SciFi had a chance to trial the theme out before it went live.* The process of switching to the unified theming was what made the alpha test of the theme possible. Since all sites are using that already, the tool we had to allow them to test wasn't available for this (or any future) site. It was in our original discussion plans to use this method but we didn't because we can't. I'm sorry. There is absolutely a plan to adjust as needed but that won't include completely going back to the drawing board and starting over.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As to the other two sites you talk about, I had pretty extensive discussions in chat - yes, I know, they're probably difficult to resurface - with both of these sites as part of helping to guide them in reworking their designs. I've not responded since because... well... I went on maternity leave, Joe got a job offer he couldn't refuse and then we've been in a holding pattern before we can start actually working on them. They are in a queue, there's just been a lot of... stuff in the way. With DAG back on track with their new PM, things like this are starting to move forward.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Catija: At least now I know what happened (and I think I knew about your maternity leave around the time you started - some threads on Meta Stack Exchange), but this at least highlights the point about communication.  Life and circumstances happen, but keeping us in the dark about progress or what's going on isn't exactly conducive to a thriving community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No arguments from me... and... I mean, I was itching enough to come back and work on stuff that I was part time after just a month away... but by then Joe left and we were in a holding pattern... but we also have to be respectful of people's private lives and allowing them to be private. I've also had interim discussions with some of the SFF users to let them know that stuff is on hold, so it's not without any interaction, just... nothing on those particular meta posts. I mean, the DBA post exists because I told them to create it and I commented on the top answer there. :) I'm trying.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Going to [the drawing board](https://www.google.com/search?q=anime+easel&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=4_8LhNpRXuptwM%253A%252CHckeSj4hDx8zvM%252C_) probably ***is*** the answer. Someone drawing at an easel is more anime than the bomb and bus.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Catija:  So...um...what's next?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure at this point.

It might work. The only advantage I can see for having it here on Stack Exchange as opposed to on a Wikia/Wiki is that Markdown is more user-friendly than WikiText, so the barrier of entry might be lower. And so more people might actually be bothered to type in that sort of information.

One possible issue I can see is the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/176445/knowing-your-limits-what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-question-title-post-image30,000 character limit for posts (I think this applies to both questions and answers). So this may be a problem if you try to tackle really long-running series such as Naruto or One Piece. With something of that scale, it might be better just to outsource the information to an actual wiki, which is better equipped to handle that quantity of information. 

I don't know of many wikis that actually have this sort of information though. Maybe those wikis could use some more promotion :P

On the other hand, it's possible have https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/102370/add-a-language-to-a-polyglot?answertab=oldest#tab-topreally long chains of answers on Stack Exchange, so it's not unfeasible. It may be doable by, for example, splitting the listing into multiple answers; I wouldn't shut the door on this one. If such a mega-question existed, most likely I would occasionally drop in to insert a soundtrack listing here or there. (I already have a few incomplete partial lists in my personal notes from my sporadic Naruto rewatches.)

In any case, there are two main use cases that I can think of where a song-episode index might be useful:

1. Finding the song from the episode + timestamp

This might be helpful if someone comes across a song in an episode and wants to know which song it is.

In these cases, an episode + timestamp index would be helpful.

The https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Madoka_Magica_SoundtrackPuella Magi Wiki has something like this. (It's not complete though.) https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Madoka_Magica_Soundtrack#Episode_1Example:

https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Madoka_Magica_Soundtrack#Episode_1

2. Finding the episodes + timestamps from the song

This might be helpful if someone is trying to find all the occurrences of a specific song in the anime. Or if someone is listening to the soundtrack and they want to know which scene it reminds them of.

In these cases, a song index would be helpful.

I know that https://nichijou.fandom.com/wiki/Category:SoundtrackNichijou Wikia has something like this. (Not every song has a complete listing though.) https://nichijou.fandom.com/wiki/Poem_of_YukkoExample:

https://nichijou.fandom.com/wiki/Poem_of_Yukko
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! I was thinking more of something like in number 1. The second song index type is also possible, and I think it can be used alongside the first type. This way it can cater to different people looking for different types of information. I also agree on the problem with long running series and I was planning on starting small first.


















In the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicAsking article it says that you can ask about

[...] a piece of merchandise that you or someone you know personally owns.

Further down the same article it says:

Are you looking to ask a question about to identifying a particular anime or manga related media?
Please note that ALL anime and manga identification questions are off-topic and will be put on hold regardless of how much context is provided.

Does this mean we are not allowed to ask for IDs on anime merchandise?
For example, I received a sitting girl figurine from a random grab-bag at a convention and have no idea what anime the figure is from. I wanted to ask for an ID of it, but I was not sure if it would get marked off-topic and be removed after reading the "Asking" help page.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "Asking" page is unclear about if ID-ing merchandise is off-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Given the wording I don't see why it wouldn't be off-topic, you're still just asking for an ID.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since it explicitly said the word "Media" I assumed it meant images, sceenshots, voice clips, etc. I've also looked around this site it mentioned how out of context images and screenshots are troublesome. I don't think of figurines when I hear the word media. This is one of the reasons I was genuinely confused; does merchandise count as "media"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why does the word media matter? "Please note that ALL anime and manga identification questions are off-topic"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would then get rid of the first line of that question for clarity. Just be forward and say that `Please note that ALL anime and manga identification questions are off-topic and will be put on hold regardless of how much context is provided.` This way there is no ambiguity. Thank you for the clarification.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AkiTanaka If you mark this question a duplicate of "Are questions regarding cosplay or anime-related items still on-topic?" instead of the current one, I'll accept it as the solution. It's definitely more related to the second link.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wimateeka unfortunately I could only retract my close vote but cannot change the target. Try flagging it as a dupe of [this question](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4142) by yourself, sorry...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's all good. I will be sure to do that. Thanks (ありがとう) @AkiTanakab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz Because it clarifies a subtle distinction between what is and isn't considered anime or manga for the purposes of identification. Books and videos are media, but backpacks and figurines aren't. Yes, identifying anime and manga is off-topic, but a figurine or doll is technically neither of those, even if it is related, unless you would suggest that staring at a statuette constitutes watching anime. Granted, I'm not sure why the distinction is important, but it's certainly reasonable to suggest that it is there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the merchandise is clearly based on science fiction or fantasy, ID questions about it are also on-topic on [Science Fiction and Fantasy: SE](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/)


















A bit over a month ago, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4245/49I presented y'all with the design we'd created for this community, and asked for some feedback. The response wasn't the most positive one, and some of the things we heard from you in Meta and in chat — aside from the things that fall in the tiny tweaks bucket — were that the design didn't represent the community and didn't feel anime-y.  

Now, as I mentioned in an edit on the previous post, https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/319274/208518our current rollout plan for new designs on the network involves simpler designs — think more https://blender.stackexchange.com/Blender, https://travel.stackexchange.com/Travel, or https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/Puzzling, and less https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/Worldbuilding. But everyone here is pretty much aware of the fact that capturing the feel of anime and manga in a single, cohesive design is not an easy task to undertake — I mean, there's a reason why this particular community, of all the communities in the network, has been waiting for a design for something like five and a half years now, having other communities "jump the queue" to get theirs. 

So, given all of the above, we decided to take a step back to evaluate our options... like, way way way back: as far back as November '13! Since then, when the first time someone from the company (you may remember Jin popping into chat to talk about it, if you've been around for long enough) publicly stated that we'd be getting a design, the idea had always been to commission an artist with experience in the style to execute this site's design. So we got in touch with someone with experience in the field, and will be getting a custom made design from 'em, that should be ready by early next month! ^_^

So, with that background outta the way, here's what you need to know:


The ideas we gathered are still gonna be the ones to inspire this new design, along with the feedback provided to the design that I announced a month back;
Given that this'll be a design generated outside our usual process, once it's rolled out we'll only be doing any styling tweaks, or fixing egregious issues we somehow miss before then;
The logo will still be an in-house production, and Lisa has tweaked it as per some of the feedback given in the previous post. While we're still figuring out how to differentiate the Main and Meta logos, here's a preview of it after tweaking it as per https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4254/49this piece of feedback:


https://i.stack.imgur.com/rh9ns.png

It's been a long wait, I know... but we're getting there! Thanks for the patience and the feedback, and I'm really looking forward to getting your final design in front of you! :D
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anime & Manga Site Design — June updateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I'm reading this right, A&M be getting a complete rework. Will the old artwork still be publicly available? (but maybe hidden) AFAIK the images have a custom hash to prevent caching on new design roll outs, which changes (daily?).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're reading it right, yes — a completely new design. Not sure about the current on still being made publicly available — though the original announcement will keep its screenshots, for sure. And am not sure what you mean with your last sentence there :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The last sentence means, even if I keep a record of every url currently used for artwork, they'll expire the day the new design comes out. Effectively deleting all the old artwork. Makes sense that it may not be available.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see. I guess what I'm missing, then, is why that's relevant? Like I said, I'm not sure about whether or not the current artwork is still gonna be made available, but if it is I wouldn't assume it'd be because it's live somewhere buried in obscure URLs, but rather explicitly made available elsewhere. I might add, though, that aside from the screenshots I don't see a great reason to do so, and I don't think we've ever left old iterations of designs available anywhere but in screenshots. Can you elaborate on why that'd be relevant? Or maybe you're just trying to figure out the mechanics? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I don't like aspects of the new design as much as this one then I can always revert those aspects back. (With Tamper Monkey)


















When you say "once it's rolled out", does this imply any kind of transition period to allow the community to see what it looks like and/or provide feedback before then?   I ask this since it seems that, once it's out, we get what we get, which may work out well, but may not.

Just want to be clear on this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're not planning on posting screenshots, etc., before rolling it out, no. The design that's in the works will benefit from being experienced live, so we're gonna go with that :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat:  So what we get is what we get?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To put it shortly: styling tweaks or egregious issues aside, yes. Though, like I mentioned, the new design will have incorporated not only the ideas we gathered that served as the basis for the design that's currently live, but also the feedback we received on it — so it'll have addressed the concerns brought up by you about its shortcomings.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, just wanted to be clear on the process.  Thanks for clarifying.


















By nature, this site is where we ask questions from both manga and anime. However %90 of the time, anime is behind the manga so asking a question from the manga can be considered as a spoiler for anime-only people.

A small example would be:


  Why the character X is doing Y?


The problem is, in the anime we still don't know X and now we are sure that X will do Y. 

Now there are many discussions about this I am aware but none of them is conclusive. Some are against it, some say it's fine. Others say we should try to do it without spoilers but if we can't then it's fine. Is it really? Let's imagine a scenario where a member of the community checks the questions daily. Then bang, he sees a spoiler from a show he is watching. He clearly did nothing wrong but the person who is seeking an answer didn't either.

Some examples from other discussions:

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/46/what-should-our-policy-be-regarding-spoilersWhat should our policy be regarding spoilers?

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/90/should-we-have-a-spoilers-tagShould we have a “spoilers” tag?

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100/what-do-we-do-with-questions-which-are-spoiler-by-natureWhat do we do with questions which are spoiler by nature?

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2654/should-this-question-have-avoided-spoilers-in-the-title-or-notShould this question have avoided spoilers in the title or not?

Thus my proposal is as follows:

We should clearly imply that the question itself is a spoiler. An example would be like:


  [Show A - Manga Spoiler] Why the character X is doing Y?


With a standard like that, at least we can create a middle ground for both of the sides.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we really allow spoilers in the title?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FYI this isn't a _sub_ reddit this is a _Q&A site_. Also when I make meta posts like this I like to link to the metas I know about so people newish to Meta know what you're talking about. It may be a good idea to link to these discussions you've mentioned.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, the concept of "sub of a site" is older than Reddit so I wasn't making a connection there. After all, we can't add new global features by our own and the hosting is handled by the StackExchange team. However, to make things clearer, edited accordingly and added some example questions to the post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you find that a title to be a bit too spoilery, you can edit the title to imply spoilers or edit out the spoilery bit. E.g., "What did X mean during Y scene in episode Z?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, we can edit it but what happens if you are the one who is spoiled.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This site isn't as popular as the movies or sci-fi stack exchanges, so this isn't as much of a concern, but I think it's also worth considering the perspective of someone on a completely different site inadvertently coming across unsolicited series spoilers in HNQ. Related discussions [here](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/361307/film-spoilers-are-showing-up-as-hot-network-questions) and [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224108/prevent-questions-with-movie-tv-shows-game-spoilers-from-appearing-in-the-hot-qu).


















The general stance I have seen so far, and been following myself regarding spoilers in titles is mentioned in the answer https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/47/1458What should our policy regarding spoilers be.


  The rule I've always followed is to include spoilers in your title only if it's required for the title to be searchable, and clearly indicate what the question is about. In other words, if you can make a good title without spoilers, do so; otherwise include spoilers. A good title is more important than spoilers. After all, the ignore tag feature will allow users to ignore any tags in a series they wish to avoid spoilers about


I do not believe we should be avoiding spoilers, just for the sake of avoiding spoilers. We should strive for quality of our content, which in some cases will require spoilers, even in the title. 

And for the people that daily check questions, and really don't want to be spoiled, can add certain tags to their ignore list, at least for the duration they do not want to be spoiled.

I don't think adding a warning would decrease the quality of the post but thanks for the input.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You mention striving for quality of content, but I'd also add that the content being _findable_ is extremely important — titles that make questions unfindable for people with the same question somewhere on the web aren't particularly useful... :)


















Note: Based off this https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/17767Code Golf answer.

Could you change the https://anime.stackexchange.com/errorerror and https://anime.stackexchange.com/err%C3%B6r404 text to be inline with the sites colour scheme.
The blue, IMO, looks out of place.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Was prolly just overlooked; will pass it along ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whoa, that's actually...the *least* you can and should do! In fact the custom error/404/captcha pages were one of the few things that *survived* the untheming process on sites with an existing design. It'd be unfortunate if new designs would entirely lack them, given that they're one of the few customizable things left.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why generic 404 and not something animeish @JNatb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnkitSharma Because now it's on SE Inc's radar and they can do that if they want to. I'm not going to ask for it to be anime related because that's almost definitely not going to happen.


















As you may have already noticed, our new design is live! ✧*｡٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و✧*

Thanks for all the input over the years, and particularly in the most recent Meta posts around this (https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4245/49here and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4229/49here). As was mentioned in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4264/49last month's update, we commissioned an artist with experience in the style to execute this community's design, and I'm really excited to present y'all with the final work, which I believe addresses most (if not all) of the concerns y'all had raised about our previous attempt.

Here are some screenshots, for posterity:  

Main site:

Meta site:

As mentioned previously, the logo also got some tweaks (https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4254/49feedback), thanks to Lisa! Our chat theme and https://twitter.com/StackAnimeTwitter account also got a refresh and will be updated soon, and you should also see some changes in the newsletter!

I mentioned in the last update that since the design would be generated outside our usual process, we'll only be doing any styling tweaks, or fixing egregious issues we somehow missed — so if you stumble upon bugs, please post 'em as an answer here! :)

I'd like to once again thank everyone here for their feedback and patience, and hope everyone enjoys this design! :D



Thanks for all the feedback below. I've added /questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed to stuff we worked on, and cleared some other doubts around stuff we didn't work on. In addition to that, there were also a few things we spotted we'd missed the first time around:


Fixed contrast issues on "site rooms" button in chat;
Fixed contrast issues on "help | faq | legal | privacy policy | mobile" links at the bottom of the page in chat;
Added the flying hat to the chat bar, to spruce it up a bit (will prolly take a bit longer to build, FYI);
Some fixes to the Twitter logo.

We were discussing the design a while ago in chat, I wrote this and https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50119499#50119499the comment received four stars:

@Jnat It's hard to pin style down into precise words. To me the mockup looks like somebody was told to make something look japanese, but rather than using the vibrant colors and thick outlines characteristic of comics and animation, they went for more of a traditional style with soft pastels and thin lines more characteristic of traditional Japanese art, kind of like this:


http://blog.japanesecreations.com/traditional-japanese-art-the-floating-world-of-ukiyo-eUtagawa Hiroshige, 1st Station: Shinagawa from series The Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido, 183(3/4)
I feel like you folk did a great job listening to that feedback and that the new background design is a good improvement in these regards, and the flatter more vibrant look helps to give it a look much more characteristic of anime. Moreover, I feel like the specific design choices invite a sense of an impending adventure with the way the folliage spreads out and the hat being blown away by the wind, just begging somebody to up between the grassy hills to get to the other side and retrieve it.
I am pleasantly surprised to say that I like the new design overall, and find it more befitting of our particular scope than what we had before. It reminds me of the appearance of a Studio Ghibili film much more-so than I anticipated. I think the only thing left is to make minor tweaks to fix minor errors such as what the others have demonstrated.
Speaking of which, if I may make one comment, I think the C.S.S. colors used in chat still appear to be optimized for the prior background. We may want to make the greens somewhat darker and earthier so that they match the grass better. It applies especially so to the area containing the chatbox.

Not sure if this is a bug or not, but https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/anime/img/site-background-image-hat.pngthe hat on the left doesn't scroll, compared to https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/anime/img/site-background-image-kite.pngthe kite on the right. Not sure which behavior is the correct one, but currently it feels inconsistent.

Observed on Chrome 75, Windows 10, with & without userscript, and additionally in incognito mode.

A nice to have but not necessarily required (and might be controversial?), 
since the kite is already scrolling, make the whole 5 clouds (https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/anime/img/site-background-image-cl-tl.pngtop-left, https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/anime/img/site-background-image-cl-tr.pngtop-right, https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/anime/img/site-background-image-cl-mid.pngmid, https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/anime/img/site-background-image-cl-bl.pngbottom-left, https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/anime/img/site-background-image-cl-br.pngbottom-right) also scroll very slowly to simulate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrollingparallax effect.

... unless the scrolling kite is actually a bug and should be static (then this is all moot)...

As the CSS definitely has `body` `background-attachment: scroll`, rather than `fixed`.


















Generally speaking, if there's targeted voting between profiles, a first offense only gets your votes between those profiles invalidated and a warning. If it persists after that, then suspensions are in order.

Another case that usually incurs in suspension — though this one happens at a first offense — is the case of sockpuppet voting fraud. You can read more on that https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/57685/208518here, and that's usually as specific as we get about it.

With all that being said, and given your last paragraph, I'll end with a bit of the text present in our "targeted votes" mod message template:


  The system has processes in place to detect various types of voting between groups of users, so if you know anyone who may be voting for your stuff in kind, please ask them to refrain before the system detects such activity and takes similar actions on their account. If by chance you created separate accounts for the purposes of voting for another, please use /contactthe contact form and the appropriate option so you can merge them without further incident.


So, yeah: sometimes the system takes care of things silently, sometimes it provides warnings for mods to take care of it, and sometimes mods may just decide to investigate something if it looks fishy. 

So, you ask, what can you do to avoid getting suspended due to this? Mostly, if you just keep to yourself and only have a single profile, you should be fine. In the rare cases when you do keep to yourself but there's still something weird going on, it'll usually be taken care of silently by the system, and you still prolly don't need to worry about it :)

Why is footer taking too much space when compared to other graduated sites with custom design? 

Following is Anime main site footer which is leaving empty space 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/jH6WP.jpg

When I compared with other sites with a custom design, the footer is looking like it is taking more space. 

Is this intentional to give space for the picture?

Other than "everyone else has a smaller footer".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peilonrayz I am just curious whether it is intentional or not. One of the reasons Joe Friend (developer who started this process of design) gave is bringing some similarity and uniformity between all the graduated sites. I am not asking it should be shorter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, that makes sense.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is just a guess on my part, but something worth noting is that if you scroll all of the way down, it covers the hat, as if you lost sight of it once you reached the hill.  If we go along with the hypothesis that you are chasing down the hat, that'd also explain why the hat is static and the kite isn't: So that you don't lose sight of it prematurely. As for the kite, it's lighter and meant to float so it might actually be further drifting upwards or staying afloat, compared to the heavier hat which would be falling back down to the ground.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The extra space is intentional, yes.


















As https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4278/45677Aki, https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4276/45677Dimitri, and https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4283/45677Nog have all mentioned: the variety of appearances for different users ought to be amalgamated somehow. I can't reproduce the appearance of https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4272/45677Jnat's view by any combination of browser or "Hide Left Navigation" and "Hide Hot Network Questions" https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/preferences/currentcheckbox settings.

Instead of seeing this on the bottom (or Jnat's view):

I see this (full page, and bottom):

https://i.stack.imgur.com/GcaSH.jpg

Even playing with "Hide Left Navigation" and "Hide Hot Network Questions" checkboxes doesn't bring the kite into view. 

Using an unusual browser (TubeMate) produces a slightly better view (though it's unlikely many people use it):

https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3Akb.jpg

I believe that the genius and subtlety of the CSS positioning is lost for many.

A fix would be to push everything to the bottom when the user is at the bottom of the webpage and proportionately scroll the kite, hat, and their 'background clouds' upward when the user is at the top of the webpage - thus providing a parallax movement that works for a majority of our users and doesn't leave some elements always hidden.

Also, it looks like you're using a really narrow screen, so you're not seeing any of the "columns" on either side of the actual content, where the hat and kite appear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat I'm using Firefox Android, in portrait mode. My screen size is 2960x1440 (HxW), so it's fairly wide; it's the way that Stack Exchange uses CSS in webpages served when you choose "Full Site" (link at the bottom, if applicable to the user) and on the browser one selects "Request Desktop Site". [Wikipedia reports that 10M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S9#Sales) phones were sold, of the exact same model that I have (as many phones as we have users), needless to say that other phones were sold too; so many people are affected by this, and see the same view as I do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JNat - Here is an animated [screen capture](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQQ4E.gif). Notice that when I scroll slowly and gently that the repositioning of the background elements ***jumps***, rather than gliding smoothly and providing a beautiful parallax movement. My phone is fast, I can load and render a page stuffed with MathJax almost instantly. I can play 60FPS videos and online gaming is fast; so it's not that my phone is slower than many laptops or that something is slow or broken (except the CSS, not my fault) on my end.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I don't like the way that the front layer covers everything when you scroll to the bottom [this **6** layer 3D CSS parallax scrolling background](https://codepen.io/samdbeckham/pen/OPXPNp) has simple code, many layers, and smooth animation on my phone.


















I was one of the people who rejected the edit and i mostly read the title of the response in the Suggested Edit Moderation Queue which was "clearly conflicts with author's intent"

this is just me but personally i feel that unless the answer is a Community Wiki edits to answers should be limited to formatting, grammar/spelling correction and/or clarification  and the only time time i feel to add new stuff to an answer is when you're quoting relevant parts from exiting links or posting something supportive to the existing information presented in the answer (ie. https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/52341adding a manga page or https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/52324episode screenshots).

now it does look like you were coming from a good place and it's not like the information was wrong, i just felt that it wasn't right as an edit. now i could be wrong and others who rejected it might have had different reasons but if the rejected edit was incorrect and Ero Sɘnnin did want the information in the answer https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/178340/could-authors-overturn-recent-community-review-decisions/295028#295028they can override the rejection being the post owner.

I'll try and help you to understand it a bit better.

Lets start off by breaking down your https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/55309/is-ash-is-he-pokemon-master-now-after-winning-alola-league-championshipfirst post: is ash is he pokemon master now?

The question


  It is mentioned in many anime theories


Here you mention that there are anime theories, theories are usually opinion based, and not necessarily based on cannon content. Because you did not reference any of these sources by for example, quoting or linking(!) to said theories it also becomes very hard for anyone to determine otherwise.

Without any other context, or details, this sounds like it is based on a opinion, and you are looking to confirm said opinion. 

the answer

The answer starts off nice, you convey that you tried to obtain the information directly from it's source, but could not obtain it. 

However, the second part of your answer mentions a lot of theories. Yet again without any source of said theories. Just looking at the content tells me that it is most likely copied verbatim from some site. By not mentioning which site, you are actually https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarismcommitting plagiarism. If you wish to quote something, always refer to where you got it from.

Just as the answer, theories implies that it is 'opinion' based. And without any source to really confirm the quotes (manga chapters, episodes, wiki articles, author notes) it becomes really hard to proof otherwise. 



Next up, lets cover https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/55312/how-professor-ox-discovered-ashs-pikachu-it-is-a-still-pokemon-mysteryHow Professor ox discovered Ash's pikachu? it is a still Pokemon mystery

The title  

The title has me a bit confused. You are asking about a non existing professor, and follow it up by making a statement that it is still a mystery.

A good title would tell somebody that looked at it what the question is about. I think this would have made for a good title, if you would have omitted the part after the ?

The question

You give a pretty elaborate explanation all though I have a very hard time tieing the knots together. Using some of the episodes as a reference as to when something happened, or manga chapters there where applicable would significantly help understanding your explanation there.

Later on in the spoiler block, you mention a theory, once again without a source, which goes and ask (3) different questions from what you tried to ask in your title. By the end of the question, I, personally, am still unclear on what you actually want to ask here. Did you want to know how Proffesor oak found pickachu? Or why pickachu didn't evolve? Or what happened ash was born?

All together it is a fairly confusing question.



Now just because the questions are closed, doesn't mean you won't be able to open them again. However you will need to improve them some what. In the https://anime.stackexchange.com/helphelp center you can find some more guidance on what makes a good question/answer as well.

That is it a still a mystery that's it. the other part is my opinion and also theories given by others... so I don't think so with the proper answer if I add up other theories... there is anything wrong?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know even  I make the changes you mentioned the question will not gonna reopen I can bet...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still edited both of them questions are very clear and to the point...


















It's a matter of stylistic preference, really, the way I see it. 

Sometimes, I've written answers in which I'd write something I took to be a fact, and subsequently found that to not be the case. Depending on how egregious the mistake was, I'd either completely remove it from the answer, or keep it there crossed out for posterity. Sometimes people use the crossout when a later chapter/episode sheds some more light on previous suppositions too.

The posts have a revision history, though, so it's really a matter of preference and style: maybe the answer completely breaks if you remove a huge chunk of text; maybe you wanna show a now-debunked train of thought; or maybe you just want to give a bit of visibility to a portion of text with a visual indication that what it says is not really correct any more, even if it had some merit a while back.

That would makes sense but I see that the answer have proven right? So is it okay to remove it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You'll notice the answer is accepted, and non-CW — but the edit was not made by its author, but rather by someone else. As such, the idea there was to leave the original author's reasoning visible, while editing in some new facts. I would keep it there, in this case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, I will keep remind that thing.


















I think it should be allowed but make it a rule for them to vote on the quality of the answer/ question rather than the topic of them here is an example:

What anime should I watch that is close to Attack on Titan?


Death Note
Well, I find that Death Note is a lot like Atack on Titan.
It was a dark theme. Death Note is about a guy who finds a book, apon careful examination he finds out that if he puts a name in the book the person in question will die soon.


Sourgen (not a real anime I only watch SnK)
This anime is also like Attack on Titan not because its dark but of its because of the god-tier animation and arial fight scene quality. The story is not as good as Attack on Titans but it has more humor in it!



hope these helped.

So it could easily be like that person being helpful and giving evidence and ect, if it workes well I see no reason why  it can't follow the rules or they might change a little

https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14712/heads-up-reputation-has-been-recalculated-for-questionsRobotnik on Arqade has summed up the key point in their own Meta so i'll quote them


  Key points:
  
  
  The reputation change only applies to questions
  It has been applied retroactively, so the reputation counts as earned when the vote was cast.
  
  
  This also means that progress towards badges like 'Epic' and "Legendary' will be calculated correctly
  
  Downvotes are unaffected, and still give -2
  There is not a clean way to see how much reputation you have gained. 
  
  
  The easiest way to get an estimate is probably to use the https://i.stack.imgur.com/bXSEb.jpgWayback machine on your https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/13/were-rewarding-the-question-askers/user profile page and compare your current rep from the most recent snapshot. 
  A more precise calculation would be: PreviousRep = CurrentRep - (QuestionUpvotes * 5).

Recently we've had our stellar diamond moderators step in the gap and close questions on the site which shouldn't be kept open for too long (mostly identification requests).

Does anyone think that we should consider asking Stack Exchange to lower the close vote threshold to 3?

The Riemann zeta-function is about reciprocal derivatives. It's representation here is within 3 dimension, with color representing depth. 

You question may be more on-topic if it were worded more in regards to what inspired the interface design than assuming it had something to do with the Riemann zeta-function, besides the fact that they seem similar. 

We cannot migrate this question because such a topic is not on-topic with any of the math-related SE sites. Please consider rephrasing your question to me more in scope with the aesthetic design rather than any mathematical theorems that you believe it may represent (you may still mention it in passing, but it should not be the main focus as it will skew the topic towards it rather that what inspired the design).

I had already mentioned the similarity with the function was something out of my imagination, so I thought I'd might as well to delete the original question. If someone is interested I might consider reopening it, but currently I don't feel any interest in dedicating effort to it anymore.


















I've been asked a couple times on the Maid Cafe if https://www.webtoons.com/en/super-hero/unordinary/list?title_no=679UnOrdinary is on-topic and thought to get more of a consensus than just making the decision myself

Why it would be on-topic


it has the "anime/manga style"
the https://unordinary.fandom.com/wiki/Uru-chanAuthor is asian in appearance
it is on LINE WEBTOON which was launched by Naver Corporation who are based in Seongnam, South Korea


Why it would not be on-topic


only in english
not mentioned as being manga or manhwa

No, this would not be on topic on A&M.

This question would not be about Anime or Manga as defined in the scope in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/helphelp center, as it is not about Anime or Manga, but about musical analysis.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. One is an barely on-topic music identification question. The other is a music theory question. Scope and context make a difference even if they are related tangentally.


















Music theory is most certainly not on-topic. 

Progressions using 
vii∘ (I–IV–vii∘–I and I–ii–vii∘–I) are less common because of the instability of diminished chords. The diminished tone dilemma you pose is encapsulated in https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/79438/are-the-diminished-chords-not-that-common-in-modern-popular-musicthis question on music.se.

Either way, such discussions are not on-topic here. Please take it to appropriate site and provide proper examples to state your case and for comparisons.

Subjective, unless worded otherwise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is not a question we can reasonably answer unless we were the composers or coordinators for the series and franchise.

Add this to your answer, please.


















No.

Say what you will about relativeness, but keep in mind we explicitly stated to you prior that music theory questions are off-topic. The subject of diminished cords is music theory. No matter how much you try to twist things it is still music theory and not on-topic. Please keep in mind that we do not have the expertise to answer these questions, and that is why they are considered off-topic.

To understand what a diminished chord, one must first understand the basics of music theory. We cannot assume that lay users of this recreational Q&A site (as diverse as it can be) can understand such concepts and comprehend your intent. Such is why the question is considered off-topic. Lack of knowledge or expertise to discern context, due to specialized knowledge beyond the current scope of the site (anime and manga fans, not professionals).

In actuality it seems that you are trying to fit a question about diminished cords, into a poorly scoped anime song [list question](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/348/what-is-the-status-of-list-questions-on-this-site).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See my answer for an expanded explanation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Associating it with a particular series does not automatically make it on-topic unfortunately.

It seems like you don't want me to be a fan with either of the series.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not going to go to have a reelaborate everything on this matter again. No matter how you twist things to try to fit, what's not on topic remains not on topic. If you insist on continuing with these trivial pursuits, I will be forced to apply sanctions on you.


















If the majority of the community does not enjoy seeing these types of questions, I am all for rolling them under the music identification questions. But there might be more to all of this besides music id-reqs.

I've been pondering about this and issues like for quite a while. It's about time we considered looking deeper instead of just scratching the surface.

What might be lurking beneath

I personally feel that there is a deeper underlying issue that lurks beneath it all. Instead of picking off types questions we don't like, I'd prefer to ask the community about what types of questions and content they wish to see more of. But I do realize that it's not an easy task due to ambiguity, so perhaps listing potential problem areas or pain points can be helpful in finding the underlying issue. Getting rid of certain types of questions feels more like addressing symptoms than addressing the cause imo.

We are what we are

We're not going to get much support from SE, inc, in developing the community, so we need to look at ourselves and see what we want more of. We've ask for feedback in the past, but most of what we got back was just numbers and data. We're free to develop our community as we like. We don't have have to commit to the same culture as other SE sites. We can set our own precedence as long as we are within SE, inc's terms and guidlines. Various incidents in the past have displaced much of the previously active community, so there have been less and less incentives for participation. We should take the good and the bad and find a way that works for us with what we have. 

Us, the community, and where we are now

The disinterest and distate in music request become apparent in a vacuum of activity as more pop up than new questions. From past experiences, I've come to understand that the community is divided or unsure on what it likes and/or would like to see, but they tend to be more united on what they wish to see less off.

We're a loose gaggle of people (with the occasional duck wandering in) from different backgrounds located in differ areas, from past experiences, coordinating an event to get together with will be tricky. 

Finding focus on the community

If we want to discuss the removal of music id-reqs we should also looking at addressing less desirable content across the site and community. Once we have a idea of the undesirable areas we can work on recifying or incentivizing the community to help contribute to the betterment of these problems, through rep bounties or other extrinsic and intrinsic means (potentially sponsored by the mods and anyone interested in contributing), via something like a bounty or quest board. 

Finding what's right for the community

Finding the right content to drive user interest is tricky. Chat lately has been a very contemptuous place for certain types of anime content, so interest and activity has waned considerably. 

Forcing content or participation can cause interest to fizzle out with time. We are community on a recreational topic so we don't command much authority in anything besides Japanese and like style cartoons. It's an interest and past time not to be take seriously by most people, despite the work that a few do to nurture what they enjoy. 

The past, present, and what's to come

In the past we've tried throwing things at a wall to see what sticks. The results, sadly, didn't develope into much. Do instead of focusing on ambigious and potentially naive like to haves. Let's focus on a listing things the community finds less desirable. If we can collaborate on that perhaps it's a direction to move in winning back participation in the community.

It's about time we thought about putting the people back into the community. Every bit of feedback from the community matters. After all, with out its users, a community is nothing but a shell. It's about time we started talking more.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that's a very worthwhile way of looking at it. I think some of the drivers behind the original identification-question discussion are key to working out what we want to be doing with this site, but turning those ideas into an actual plan is going to take some work.


















Dear Fellow Members and Lurkers of the Community,

In these trying pandemic times, we find ourselves with an excess of time and a need to apply it. Since our graduation and our “design graduation” we’ve had many bumps in the road arriving to where we are today. Due to various personal obligations and political turmoils, the community has stagnated a bit and could use some revitalization. To start rectifying, the active moderation staff here, Dimitri mx and myself, have gotten together to make plans to clean up and revitalize that which has been lost throughout the years. We do not expect immediate results, but we intend to do some clean up and enhancements where we can. Any community members willing to contribute are welcome to join and reach out, even if it is to provide minor feedback.

The some of the objectives of this initiative we have planned include, but is not limited to:


Consolidating all current site policies in an easy to reference and
provide a platform to review and propose changes to these
policies.
A better, more customized FAQ (i.e. a how to use guide) for new users
for introducing them to the Q&A site format as well as the community
culture in general.
Investigating, exploring, and deprecating unpopular questions and
topics.
Exploring avenues to raise user interests, such community content
corners for engagement.
Opening up a new venue for private feedback (positive and negative).


With this initiative, the active moderation staff intends to provide better transparency on efforts concerning this site and it’s community in general. We intend to post an update to the community at least once a month (tentatively set for the first weekend of each month). Users are free to provide feedback as an answer via the meta post, contact form, or by email as they find appropriate. 

Why do this?

Since the concept of this community from Area 51, to the beta, to it’s graduation, until now. There have been many great policies created by new and old members of the community that have persisted to the present day. Unfortunately there hasn’t been an efficient means to catalog these answers, so some of them have been collecting dust.

What's on the agenda this month?

This month, we are looking to create a consolidated master list of current and existing site policies, with the intent to create a system for better tracking, updating, and providing feedback and revisions for these policies. We intend to use this as a springboard for enhancements to various areas of on-topicness, consistency on how to use certain tags, possibly provide a style guide for consolidating tag wikis and wiki excerpts, and possibly also provide guidelines for those answers that “need citations”. This is a long term endeavor, so we don’t intend to roll out everything all at once, we also expect to make changes to existing plans as we move forward. 

Additionally, because the community has spoken out about it we will be working on the depreciation of music id-requests and providing a written policy to discourage these types of unpopular questions. Specific details beyond the previous meta post concerning the topic are pending as we are still in the process of discussion.

Anything else?

As a bit of a side note, we are looking to implement a content corner of sorts mostly for the amusement of the community. It’s mostly for the enjoyment of the community to top-off every announcement. Participation is optional, feedback would be appreciated. 

Contributions and coordination from the community (no matter how minor) is welcome and appreciated at all times. We also understand that some people would feel uncomfortable with public forums, for those you can also reach out to us directly (via the contact form or by email). You will find the means to contact us in our A&M community profiles.

Without wax,

Your friendly neighborhood Anime & Manga Moderators (кяαzєя & dimitri mx)



With all that out of the way, here's something for your amusement:

Did You Know? – Anime and Manga Edition 

When you read a manga or watch an anime, so you ever wonder what those seemingly permanent lines on the cheeks of characters are? 

They are called "kote lines" (コテ線) likely originated from KoteKoteJapan コテコテJAPAN, a column in a 90's magazine that focused on arcade games. 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/5lhqX.jpg
https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eqaea.jpg
https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJdb2.jpg

These lines are not there to express emotion, but are there to give dimensionality to the cheeks or make them seem more rosy. Variations can be expressed in many ways with dark colored lines or red color ones. Notable examples include the main protagonist of the Pokemon, Fafner, Slayers, Sailor Moon, Hidamari Sketch, amongst other series. Sometimes you they can be referred to as "whiskers" (ヒゲ, hige) by those unfamiliar with the term.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now Announcing: A New Initiative for Anime & Manga SE Engagement (it's a work in progress~)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm intrigued.  How can I help?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Makoto For starters, we'd love to hear about your taught on the first 2 points we tackling. 
Know a good way to consolidate the policies?
Perhaps you have insight on outdated policies you'd like to share. Or know how to improve user engagement/involvement.
Perhaps you have ideas on current or future issues that can/should be tackled as well.
Aka, we are open to all feedback and suggestions for A&M, so feel free to share anything and everything.
Or if you prefer to a more hands-on assistance, I'd suggest we touch base in chat/discord to see how we can get that up and going.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We'll see how it goes with schedules and free time and all of that.  I will contribute an answer or two on the first two points, though; figure that's a safe enough start.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Investigating, exploring, and deprecating unpopular questions and topics." -- I think this is addressing the wrong problem. I haven't been active on this site in going on three years, and it's not because I was offended by the presence of music identification questions. It's because there was almost nothing I was interested in answering and nobody to answer what I asked. That's why general id requests became such a problem that we had to ban them, but Literature and SFF haven't---because there was nothing else going on here to balance them out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's been a while since you've been in these parts @Torisuda.  I'd really want you to capture your thoughts somewhere better than a comment - maybe an answer?


















Consolidating all Site Policies

To be fair, we don't have a whole lot in the way of this...


https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4189/102What identification requests are acceptable here? Otherwise, where else can I possibly get helped with it?
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2535/102What topics outside of anime and manga can I ask about?
https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/404/102How do we deal with copyrighted material on our site? (only because this one https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4050/102wound up biting us pretty hard a while back)


The big thing is to make it obvious and up-front about what policies we've formed as a result of our community being around for a while.  The big ones that I can think of are up above.

I want to make it clear that:


We're perfectly OK with questions about Manwha.
We're cool with Avatar, RWBY and Legend of Korra.
We like talking about Anime games, like Touhou, Kantai Collection and iM@S.
Light novels are cool tool; we like to read as well.
Visual novels are games first (so no gameplay pointers), but plot and story aren't out of scope.
We don't tolerate links to fansubs/fandubs or any sites which encourage the piracy of Anime/Manga.
We can talk about music in anime, we're just https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4350/102trying to decide if we're as keen on identifying it for you.


How should we go about conveying this?

The above is all meta content, and would ideally be the first thing someone sees when they post a question on the site.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/AyMEh.png

It can't be shoved off to the right since no one will ever look at it, and it would make this whole exercise fruitless.  We could hope for someone to - maybe - put in some regular expressions to filter out obvious phrases like, "I forgot the name of" in a question, or "I'm looking for this anime/manga/show/book/etc", but honestly that involves a dev's time and I get the distinct impression that's costly right now.

How should we go about revising, revisiting and updating these policies?

One thing I noticed that we lack is a FAQ meta post which contains a link to all of our FAQs.  I may create one before the end of the weekend just to get that ball rolling, but this can serve as a main hub of where information is added which pertains to the actual FAQ of the site.  This can also give us the appropriate visibility into what we're saying are our policies, or what we're thinking about should become our policies.

At the end of the day, it might turn out that we have too many.

A better FAQ

I feel like this is a separate page that is built by Stack Exchange and maintained in some capacity by us.  I don't want to even think about how to wire it up, but the stark reality is that what we get "for free" doesn't seem to cover it, nor does it give us the ability to freely elaborate or describe why we don't want questions of type X on the site without making someone go on a treasure hunt on Meta.

Maybe something that is rooted in Community Wiki which gives us the same presentation abilities as the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicactual on-topic page.

This, too, would require dev/CM attention, though.



I'm guessing then that if we're looking to improve on these things and really make it clear what we're about (e.g. celebrating what we want to talk about and letting everyone know what our scope is which also serves to inform what we don't want to talk about), we may have to get on Stack Exchange's radar sooner rather than later.  I don't believe that we can motivate a lot of change without their involvement, unless I'm not thinking outside the box enough here.

Better than putting it on a completely separate page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It wouldn't *hurt* @ahiijny, but my sometimes controversial opinion is that it's worth doing a little more work up front to make things easier down the road.  People already don't read our FAQ or Meta to determine if their identification question is on-topic or not, and it feels like anything short of putting this information directly in front of a question asker is not enough to get their attention.


















I think Anime SE is a really good community for Anime/Manga fans to discuss their opinions about animes or mangas and anything related to them. So I think we should allow opinion-based questions and maybe add a new tag for such questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we allow opinion based questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I removed the part about downvoting from your question. [Voting works a bit differently](https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/whats-meta) on Meta. And you can take the up and downvotes as a meassure of how much people agree or disagree with your post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related, possibly duplicate: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/145/35679b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx But wouldn't the post become hidden to other users if it's downvoted? So even people who have positive opinions about it won't be able to see the post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IIRC, questions on Meta are only hidden if their score drops below -8 (as opposed to -3 on the main site). Even then, you can still see them by just going to the "Questions" tab instead of the "Home" tab.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@F1Krazy No my question is regarding completely opinion-based questions such as 'Why do people like Anime X?'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All though the question linked might not reflect that. The answers on that post should sufficiently answer your question



















  I wonder whether the question is still fine if instead of just one anime/mange, I provide a list of anime/mange?`


Given the questions current phrasing, I would say no, it would not be on-topic.

The question would likely become too broad, and not meet the criteria required for a list question anymore.

The policy regarding this can be found over here https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/348/1458What is the status of list questions on this site?, but for convenience I have included them below as well


The list criteria is specific and to the point.  
The list criteria is not asking about a list of abstract concepts or anime series featuring some theme.
The list items can be determined objectively, without need for opinion.
The list is reasonably scoped.
The list isn't prone to rapid change.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ooker Additionally you may want to elaborate a bit on what you would like to use this data/information for. Perhaps I/we can assist in making it a fitting question for A&M


















If we want to make sure a (new) user sees that questions about identifying music or anime from descriptions will probably be deleted, we need to be able to:

Write some detection algos (maybe just Regex will not be enough for this, maybe we'll need some complex if-else expression engine, idk);

This would require SE developer time, but I think if we present it right, other sites will also find this very useful and it will not be just for A&M;
I think having a testing page like for SE database queries would be ideal. I don't know if it's reasonable to ask SE to develop that, but I also have a hard time imagining how one would test a proposed change without it;
Moderators might have to edit them after voting and agreeing on change proposals from the community on Meta;


As the user types their question title and body, run it through the detection algo and if there are any matches with potential rules this question might break, show them as bright yellow/orange list items that pop up either on top of the question form or in the sidebar (popping up and doing a short bright CSS color transition should attract attention).

Make sure the message is clear that these autodetected issues are potential and if the user knows what they're doing, their question could be fine to post, because this is not a hard blocking rule that prevents from posting, but a very loud warning that, let's be honest, it's very likely that it's probably an ID request that will be removed soon after posting.




Regarding reviewing all the policies. If the goal is to review all policies and see which ones are no longer in power, and which ones are still active, we're gonna need better tools than what the SE Q&A engine provides natively.
Maybe check out one of your local country's online legal directories - lawyers generally have a better than average user interface for keeping track of updates and deprecation notices on complicated webs of laws. This is pretty close to what we would be trying to achieve here.
Things I would look for in such a tool:

Screen space would need to be packed with items.

Immediately visible https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/activeactive and /questions/tagged/deprecateddeprecated, /questions/tagged/mergedmerged tags for policies which make it easy to focus on the ones that are still worth attention;

List of Reviewed / Unreviewed meta posts;

A meta post can be:

Policy - with optional tags like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/proposed-changeproposed-change (not yet approved or rejected), https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/approved-changeapproved-change, https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rejected-changerejected-change




Timeline of changes to a given policy to visually keep track of meta posts throughout history advocating for establishment / change / abolishment of a policy, and the result of each meta discussion's outcome (as written by reviewers, see next point);

List of Reviewed / Unreviewed policies - compiled from Meta Posts which were deemed to establish or alter specific policies;

Compact review action log in form of usernames/avatars and text descriptions or icons like so:

Policy 1 - anime ID requests are not allowed

confirm - see MetaPost1 - User1;
confirm - see MetaPost2 - User2;
reject: - I think MetaPost3 and MetaPost4 said they were still allowed? - User3;

MetaPost4 and MetaPost5 which were posted after MetaPost3 confirm that the community decided to ban them - User2;
Understandable, have a nice day :p - User3;






A threaded comment space under each policy to discuss its review activity, to come to agreement on what the result of the meta post is;


SE's native tools definitely don't have anything close to this, and I don't know how to make it comfortable for collaboration if users wish to stay more than less anonymous to each other in this effort as they are in using SE sites normally without hindering their ability to use these tools.
This will be a lot of effort, and my first thought is "I sure don't want my effort to go to waste", so I would make sure the work will be available publicly for backup and the tools be made with effort preservation and reuse in mind.
Personally, I can see myself developing parts of these tools or taking part in designing the workflow, but to do the entire thing on my own... And then someone would have to use the tools to actually review all the meta posts. You know. Mixed feelings and all that :p

I would like to revisit the reasons for using SE Q&A sites, and A&M in partucular, and whether you still feel like it's something you're interested in using as an average user would, or if something changed for you and why.
Please reflect on these thoughts:

Do you ask questions?

Do you post answers?

Do you engage in Meta more often than on the main site?

Do you still find it worthwhile to ask new questions, or do you now not bother because it would not be as interesting to know the answer (because it's something trivial or not that important and you can live just fine without knowing the answer)?

Would you rather (and do you) talk about anime/manga/VNs/games in a free format (chat/forum) than engage in Q&A activities?

Do you think in recent years fewer question-worthy works have been produces in the anime and manga space which led to the expected result of fewer questions being asked?

Or do you think that over the years of experience watching and reading, you have come to understand Japanese culture and anime/manga industry background more, so that you usually can figure out the answer to your questions on your own, and so asking (or posting a question and the answer) does not seem worthwhile to you?

Do you think posting trivial facts about minor mysteries would not be a worthy addition to the site's list of questions and so you often choose to not post these types of questions?


And lastly:

How do you think this site could benefit from (more or different) user interaction?
Would it go too far out of scope of the Q&A site's purpose and/or introduce too much responsibility for the moderating part of the community?
Do you think we need more of the same activity?
Do you think we should find new interesting ways to engage old and new users? Perhaps going out of the limited scope of just questions and answers? Something we could do in chats or revitalize the group anime watching sessions?
What are your thoughts on related forms of entertainment and how do you think they could be introduces more into this community?
How would you like to have fun spending time with other people interested in anime, manga and related entertainment?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What made you join A&M and engage with the community/site in the first place? How has it changed over time? What could engage you once again?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn’t have time to write an answer for the other post but I think these are the questions that need to be asked if this site wants to create a community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a sobering thread…


















I stopped participating in this site because the Q&A format made it awkward or impossible to talk about anime in the way that I was interested in doing.
The Stack Exchange Q&A format was designed for programming. It works well for programming. It works well for other tech topics. It works pretty well for mathematics, engineering, and hard sciences like physics and chemistry. It works okay for writing, languages, music theory, and law, because those topics have bodies of rules that are widely accepted. It sort of works for parenting, pets, interpersonal relations, cooking, personal finance, travel, and the outdoors, because people can share their experience in a focused way.
The Stack Exchange Q&A format does not work well for fiction. I've participated in this site, Literature, Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and Movies and TV, and none of them lent themselves to the Q&A format. The community had to search for a way to pound their topics into the Q&A format. On Sci-Fi and Fantasy, there was a known canon of popular universes with large bodies of complex rules, so the site organized itself around rules lawyering in fictional universes---"What if Harry Potter disarmed Draco Malfoy who married Severus Snape who owned the Elder Wand? Would Harry Potter own the Elder Wand?"
Movies and TV and this site both organized themselves around plot explanation and trivia. This site also got some mileage out of explaining Japanese cultural references and the genre conventions of anime, like why the characters all look white or why they get nosebleeds when they're horny. Those all fit neatly into the Stack Exchange format. You link an old Answerman column and you're done. The kinds of things I wanted to talk about didn't. I was more interested in literary analysis of anime---story structure, character, theme, symbolism, historical context, intertextuality.
You can kind of do that in the Q&A format. Literature has been more successful at fostering it than the other media sites. But even on Literature, I've always found the format constraining. Sometimes I observe something interesting and want to write it up and share it, but the only way to do it was through self-answers to awkwardly worded questions that presume the answer. We had similar cases on Anime and Manga; people would write interesting, detailed, well researched essays analyzing an anime series, and then they would tack on some clunky verbiage at the front for that "Question" box that the site makes you put something in.
And the community three years ago was in a bad spot. We were already running out of general interest questions and plot questions for the most popular shows (One Piece, Dragon Ball, Naruto, My Hero Academia, Bleach, Death Note). The site was flooded with lazy identification requests. There was a bitter fight to ban them. Even people from other sites waded into the fray to fight over it. They were finally banned, and site activity slowed to a crawl. A squad of users who didn't post questions or answers at all anymore began squatting on the review queues and closing or deleting anything that didn't look like it could be answered with a compiler. It was more fun to write on my blog. There, I didn't have to tack on pointless leading questions to make some Javascript accept my post. I didn't have to worry about catching shit from some squad of people who deemed my post too opinion-based. I could scrawl down messy thoughts and refine them in a later post. I could write things as dumb or as poorly researched as I wanted, and learn from it, and do better next time.
I'm too used to that freedom now, and I won't be coming back to this site as a regular user. This is a Stack Exchange site, and anyone who chooses to participate here is stuck with that restrictive Q&A format. I see that as the question that someone needs to answer if this site is to become a healthy community again: what's the value of a Stack Exchange-style Q&A site about anime and manga? Why would anyone want to talk about anime in this restrictive format meant for programming questions when there are blogs and forums and subreddits and comment sections where they can just love anime and talk about it however they want? What value do the Stack Exchange rules add to the discussion of anime? And how do you keep the community friendly and accepting while hewing to Stack Exchange's rules? How do you work with people who are probably quite young, who probably speak English as a second or third or tenth language, who post a badly written question that violates multiple rules, so that they come away feeling welcomed and satisfied while also getting to participate in the site on its terms?
Personally I don't think it's possible. I don't think the Stack Exchange format adds any value to the discussion of anime. But I hope y'all who are still on this site asking what can be done to make it better can prove me wrong.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I completely agree with the daunting limitation of the programming Q&A format suppressing more free dialogue, although I don't think SE would (even in better days) consider expanding its entertainment portion of sites into discussion forum territory. It just might be too hard to moderate for the regulars here who are so used to the SE culture of Q&A moderation that it could turn into a disaster. It's hard to tell what the heads at the SE company are thinking these days in terms of expansion and "engaging new audience at any(?) cost". Time could tell, but we can ask first and find out sooner.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Although I do think there is value in the strict Q&A format for entertainment questions for when you want to quickly and without noise find out the explanation for some event in a complicated detective story or character relationship. Or what the best order of watching a show or a set of connected movies is. These are great types of questions for the restricted clean Q&A format. But sure, if you want to have freeform discussions, right now there is no support for that here yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5SciFi had a blog, maybe we could also figure out a way to have that. I'd rather try to go for the most diversity from the get go and talk about threaded comment discussion area (like reddit but you know, with better visual page design). That would both support blogging and forum-like discussions. Personally I think the classic single-depth response forum threads are outdated and threads with tree-structured comment branches supersede that format with almost no downsides. If we were to ask for such a feature from SE, I would not expect much. Perhaps we could affiliate with an existing site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Connecting logins so that users wouldn't have to create separate accounts while separating moderation teams would help prevent one set of rules and moderation practices not creep into the other platforms, but still maintain a sense of unity between different formats. But I don't have much experience in such projects, so I don't know how great of an idea that would be. Maybe more experienced community people could know more, and if it's worth exploring for us here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Hakase Yeah, definitely agree that SE isn't going to give us anything. Even Stack Overflow isn't bringing in the dollars for them at this point. Also agree that the Stack Overflow culture of moderation is too strong to overcome. Literature has had some success at adopting looser moderation policies but that's made their scope very confusing. I have no idea what questions are on topic there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you're right about what questions about anime the Q&A format works for, but the problem is those questions are all completely transactional, and I don't see how you build a community around them. If I come here because I want to know watch orders, I don't care about the person who answers it. It could just as well be a bot that scrapes Wikipedia. And there's no room for answerers to bring anything unique to the table in writing their answers. I think those are both important for building online communities; I have to be able to get a sense of the person behind the text.


















There is a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/girlgirl tag which is actually about GIRL, an animation short by Hibiki Yoshizaki published on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Animator_ExpoJapan Animator Expo. However, recent questions tagged with this were usually about ID requests for anime/manga with girl characters.
This issue was brought up once in https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/54635020#54635020the chat,

i wonder if we should change the tag itself? or maybe add a note to it's usage as i see it alot on id requests

which I somewhat agree with.
While the tag already has an excerpt (which unfortunately is not effective), without any additional context, the current name itself also looks like a meta tag, possibly affecting its misusage.
I also proposed some alternatives in https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/54635567#54635567the chat, like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/girl-hibiki-yoshizakigirl-hibiki-yoshizaki or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/girl-japan-animator-expogirl-japan-animator-expo.
But still, should the tag be renamed at all? If so, to what name?

P.S.: While this discussion is partially initiated due to the common mistagging with ID requests, I acknowledge that renaming this tag might not reduce future ID requests.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename [girl] tag to clarify that it is not about a general topic about girlb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Another one](https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/58008/35679)....


















Tag merged to https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/girl-daokogirl-daoko

We have no baseline policy for such cases. But we typically don't attach the director to works in particular or events. We could start outlining short length (especially ones with very generic names), one-off works with the -short syntax.
Alternatively, in the case of this particular work, it features the rapper DAOKO. We can render the tag as girl-daoko, in the context as "Girl" feat. DAOKO, even if it is a collaboration work, DAOKO's music is the primary fixture and he has first credit. If we use this as a precedent, we could attach the name of the first credit (we can go off a combination of press releases and/or the average of general internet consensus for this) to future works that have short and or generic titles to different site them.
I do not believe that adding the event to the tag would be a good syntax for classification as I feel that it belongs as its own standalone tag along with that of the director. In the case of this particular work, the performing art's name stands out above the expo and the director amongst the mainstream masses.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair point about not attaching the director's name, I was thinking more of using the author's name (in general case) instead. Also, after some consideration, while `girl-short` is suitable, my personal feeling is that it's still more prone to misusage (e.g. "a short girl") than `girl-daoko`, which hopefully can make the poster to think twice... but feel free to peruse either.


















You are again trying to push a particular argument based on preexisting personal biases. Lack of effort, broadly defined, can include, but is not limited to a result that may show up on the first page of search results, such as the Amino link.
It should be noted that you do not define any obstacles impeding progress or effort that can otherwise be done yourself. Your question comes off as sounding biased and/or self-selfing to other users who would have easily found the same information by taking a few minutes to do their own research work. The expected usage of question and answer sites such as Stack Exchange is for users to find solutions to problem they are typically unable to resolve by themselves. Your question is one that any user able to use an internet search engine can find with little to no effort.
Many users may question your intent as it comes off as your trying to bring up a particular topic to drive discussion on a certain topic (even if you are to deny) by asking a question that is easily answerable, not requiring much research effort or technical expertise (e.g. What color is Y main character's hair from the popular series X).
It's akin to asking someone to hand you an object that is within your reaching distance because you are unwilling to make the effort yourself. People here volunteer their time and effort to provide answers to problems other uses have. These trivial pursuits on low effort questions detract from and dilute the efforts made by those that are legitimately trying to find solutions to questions they cannot find answers to themselves and those that attempt to provide solutions to those questions.
If you truly and sincerely are unable to find solutions to these seemingly simple and easy to find question, at least take some time to explain why/where/how you struggle finding an answer. Showing that you at least made an effort yourself if better than not doing so.
With that said your particular gravitation towards a particular series makes us infer that your intent is more so to drum up attention to a particular set of series and topics than to address an existing issue. In other words, a solution in search of a problem.
I am again trying to break things down and explain them for one last time. Further escalation of matters (related this and previous meta posts) from you will be dismissed with prejudice moving forward. If your are still unsatisfied, you may bring it up further with the Stack Exchange Community Team via the contact form linked at the footer or at team@stackoverflow.com or team@stackexchange.com.
We have attempted to explain ourselves and find compromise, but your incessant stubbornness here and on other Stack Exchange communities have left us with no other reasonable discourse. We will forced move to censure if pressed futher.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's clear that this conversation is going nowhere. I am locking the comments. This discussion has ended. If you are dissatisfied with thing, please voice your concerns to the community team via the contact methods provided in the above answer.



















I'd like to propose using using vote score on the policy proposal, at least 5, ideally 10 vote score to secure consensus and be considered accepted by the community.
Policy proposals (in the question body or in an answer to a clarification question about a policy) should be given at least a week's time for review (more if it is a major policy change, at least a month) before they are regarded as accepted, regardless of the amount of votes on the post.

Having a policy be accepted by the question's score seems like bad design.

When upvoting a question it is unclear if you're saying "yes I agree" or "yes this should be discussed".

Lumping all these votes together can cause policies that shouldn't be accepted to be accepted.
"Should we X?" which is upvoted to 20, but there is no clear winning side in the answers.

If you decide on a policy saying all votes on a question should be counted as "yes I agree". This can cause policies that should be discussed from not getting a score high enough to hit the community bulletin, under Hot Meta Posts. And may not get the score they need to get tagged correctly. (disputed vs declined)


This can be solved by just measuring answers.

Some of the suggested policy seems incomplete or undefined. Who deicides what is "a satisfactory manner"? If everyone wants the policy to be accepted, but there's a conflict on something small what happens?

In the means of a tie with high votes and no clear winner, although rare, it would be up to the moderators to find a compromise between the two and represent the proposal for a new vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would probably be clearer to require all proposals to be a meta answer to be voted on instead of policy proposals in the meta question. Votes on the question would be counted as "this should be discussed", votes on the answers will be counted as "this should be accepted". How does that sound?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@кяαzєя (In response to your second comment) To me that sounds right.


















I want to make a new tag for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNA:_Brand_New_AnimalStudio Trigger's BNA as I noticed there was no tag for it.
I also didn't see any best practice guides here or in the help section about how to create a tag for an anime/manga.
Not sure what I should call the new tag for this anime so I wanted a second opinion:

BNA
brand-new-animal
romaji bi-enu-e

I'm temped to pick either of the first two. My qualm with the first is I don't know what to do if there is some other anime/manga that already uses this short hand name. Nor do I know what will happen if I use BNA and then some other anime/manga is made that also goes by "BNA" when the tag already exists for Studio Trigger's BNA.
Thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should I call the BNA/Brand New Animal/Bī enu ē tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Does this perhaps answer the question?](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/522/1458)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks I couldn't find anything helpful. Can this be moved/added to the [anime stack exchange help center](https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/search?q=tag) somehow?


















Based on personal preference:

I think https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bna-brand-new-animalbna-brand-new-animal can be a good compromise considering that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNA:_Brand_New_AnimalWikipedia and https://brand-new-animal.fandom.com/wiki/BNA:_Brand_New_AnimalFandom Wiki use BNA: Brand New Animal.
Otherwise, create https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/brand-new-animalbrand-new-animal (and optionally, synonymize https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bnabna to it), as per https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/521/2516How do we want to name series tags?.
I don't think 'bi-enu-e' (certainly not with the diacritics) is something that people commonly use to refer to it.

That said, https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagscreating a new tag needs 300 rep, and without existing questions, the tag cannot be created. Consider using https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retagretag instead for the moment, as per https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/398/2516Shouldn't we have just one "retag" tag?.

That fixes a lot of the issues and makes it clear "which bna" if there are multiple. Also I didn't know that tags now need 300 rep. I thought I read in one of the older meta posts it was 150. Thanks for letting me know! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wimateeka ah, the 150 rep was when the site hadn't got its site design yet. After that, [the rep threshold was raised](https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4251/2516).


















Thanks for the interest, folks. We've now set a date for the election to start question collection next Monday, October 12th, 2020. Nominations will open the following week in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/election/44th moderator election.

It's time for us all to consider holding an election for a new volunteer moderator on A&M.
The last election we have held was https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4089/2017-community-moderator-election-resultsback in 2017, at which point I joined the moderator team.
Ever since the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4080/1458Moderator Questionare of that year, I wanted to see if we could diversify our community. And very recently https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/users/63/%d0%ba%d1%8f%ce%b1z%d1%94%d1%8fкяαzєя♦ and I started the chain of monthly engagement posts, in part to see if we could achieve just that some how.
Hence we could use another set of hands to help us with moderation, and improving the community.
In the end, it's not a lot of work to being a moderator, and this is a relatively small SE site
You can also take a look at https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/site-moderatorsWho are the site moderators, and what is their role here? and the https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/Theory of moderation (revisited) to get a bit of a feeling as to what being a moderator actually entails.
Please leave an answer if you'd be willing to run for a moderator position, should we decide to run an election.
NOTE: This is not an official election nomination thread, just a "pulse check" to get a notion of how many people here would be willing to step up.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e52020 Potential Community Moderator Election - Community Interest Checkb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since this is a pulse is there like a minimum activity bar? Say only one person answers then no election will be held?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since we'd be aiming for a single-slot election, we'd need at least 2 candidates for the election to not fail. As such, I think at least 2 people demonstrating interest here is likely enough to go ahead with the election — if we have just one, though, the CM and moderator teams will discuss whether we wanna push forward with an election that might fail, or if we wanna wait for a bit longer.


















Just to start the ball rolling, I'm interested in running as a moderator on Anime.SE.
While I'm already a moderator on Android.SE, there's really nothing much to handle with the current mod team on there (just a daily NAA and explicit off-topic questions clean-up, nuking a handful of spam, etc...), and I'm still able to put some time to visit Anime.SE daily to check almost all of the new posts.
However, I'm also encouraging other users who haven't already been a mod on any SE site to join this mod team and taste the experience :)

Following Aki Tanaka's encouragement, I too am interested as running for a moderator on Anime SE.
Arqade SE, the site I am primarily active on, held a moderator election last year. I considered participating in the election, but the responsibilities would have been too much for me to handle at the moment in time. Since Anime SE is smaller, I would like to put my name into the hat as a future moderator

The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4402/49here.


Anime & Manga is scheduled for an election https://anime.stackexchange.com/election/4next week, October 19, 2020. In connection with that, we will be holding a Q&A with the candidates. This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.
Here's how it'll work:

Until the nomination phase, (so, until October 19, 2020 at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 pm EDT on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post one question per answer.

We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.

If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of [text](link), as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.

This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into currently.

At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election.

Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, typically containing 10 questions in total.

I feel like https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4070/20275Senshin's question from the 2017 Mod election is still applicable today, with slight modifications.
How much do you know about the following series: Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, and Attack on Titan?
These series are some of the https://data.stackexchange.com/anime/query/1310219/2020-anime-manga-top-questionstop tags as of 2020 that I see more of than others. To date, I still see many (mostly poorly written) questions regarding the Naruto series despite it officially coming to an end in 2017. And as far as I can tell, My Hero Academia and Attack on Titan are becoming more popular as the days go by.
As Senshin also posted as well:`

Knowing about these series is by no means a requirement, of course. But if candidates A and B are identical except that A has an encyclopedic knowledge of Naruto while B has an encyclopedic knowledge of (say) Doraemon, I would vote for A.

As we've seen thru the years paradigms shift as do the taste and interest of audience. A good generalist mentality to cover many based can be more beneficial than a specialist one in fewer areas. Being able to reach out or defer to other mods or users for the knowledge or expertise you can make way for a better balancing of priorities. Being polarized to certain tags over others might cause other areas to be neglected.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@кяαzєя That is a good point, I didn't looked at it from that perspective when submitting the question :) In the next 5 years, the top anime/manga could be completely different than what it is today


















A question was asked https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4314/48808a while back about lowering the close vote threshold from 5 to 3. Since moderator support for such a move is critical, do you think the current threshold is fine or should it be lowered, and why?

In your opinion, what do moderators do?


Moderators are more than just users – they are leaders. Being elected as a moderator means the community has put their trust in you to lead by example while maintaining a positive and friendly experience to all users in the community.


How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?


A user who posts high quality questions and answers are not automatically exempted from following the rules.
The first thing I would do to resolve this is handle any flags accordingly, and then talk to the user about their behavior in the site. If the user complies and I see a noticeable change, then no further action would be required.
If the user continues to raise issues, then I give would them a warning and reach out to another moderator to talk to the user about their behavior. Who knows, I may have rubbed them the wrong way in the past and they do not want to listen to me specifically.
After given a warning by myself and a secondary moderator, and there are no changes in their behavior, then I would discuss with moderator team about initiating a suspension.


How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?


If felt like the question shouldn’t have been closed or deleted, then I would reach out to the moderator who handled the question and inquire about the reason that lead to their conclusion. Single-handedly undoing their action would be an abuse of power.
If resolution is met and both parties agreed on re-opening or un-deleting the question, then I would let them handle it as such.


What should responsible moderators not do with their power? What behavior have you disliked in moderators (on any SE or elsewhere) that you vow you'll never do?


This one ties back to #3. In my experience as a general user in other another site, I have seen a moderator close a question because they believed to be off-topic. The question was reaching into some gray areas and the on-topicness was questionable to begin with, but the community disagreed with the vote and the question received enough votes to have it re-opened. In-turn, the moderator closed the question again.
In this situation, closing the question a second time was an abuse of power and overruling the decisions of the community. Unless it is explicitly off-topic (anime/manga identification requests, recommendations, a question that isn’t even a question, etc…), I would leave it up to community to submit their close votes and flags before stepping in.


A user has posted a question which by itself is fine and is answerable, however the user's actions involving the question has been troubling (ie. spamming non-answers, spamming the question link in comments across the site, defacing edits, harassing/abusive behavior to other users who answer/comment/discuss). Along with any possible sanctions against the user, do you think any action should be taken against the question?


I say this would depend on the quality and value of the question. If it were a simple question – music identification request tagged to a specific anime for example – I would move forward with deleting the question. While these questions are answerable, they are not highly sought after and likely will go unnoticed.
Now say the question was something that would receive a lot of attention, such as https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19724Where is Eren's father Dr. Jaeger?, then I would say leave the question open and allow people to answer. Since the user had that much negative activity, they were likely either suspended or were deleted all together (which I have seen to be the case for new or unregistered users). The question may go unaccepted, but it would be a highly valued question that people would want answered.


A question was asked https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4314/48808a while back about lowering the close vote threshold from 5 to 3. Since moderator support for such a move is critical, do you think the current threshold is fine or should it be lowered, and why?


I am in full support on moving forward with lowering the close vote threshold to 3 for Anime & Manga. In the last few months, I have seen many reviews struggle to past 3 votes and the last vote has typically been a moderator.
In the past there has been, and possibly can be again, a steady amount of users who go through the review queue where 5 votes would be easily achievable, but I do not believe that holds true for the time being. While being a moderator means I can finalize the close, that doesn’t mean the community should rely on moderators for such action.


You (a moderator) and another community member both answer a question on the site. The other answer is well written but (objectively) incorrect, and has gathered a similar amount of upvotes to yours. What do you do?


It is not up to a moderator to throw down the hammer and delete answers that provide incorrect information. I would simply comment on the answer to provide information on why it is incorrect, and then go on my merry way. From there, it is up to the user to decide on whether they should edit the answer to become valid and useful, or delete it entirely.


Where do you want to see the site and/or community go in the near future? Where don't you want to see it go? (Optional: provide the rationale behind your decisions.)


A majority of this section can be seen in my answers for #9. I want Anime & Manga to be a welcoming site that gives provides users with a great experience when inquiring about anime and manga. However, I feel like the scatter and confusing policies can make the site feel unwelcoming to new users and not give them much incentive to return.


The community as a whole has many things that are can be seen as lack, underdeveloped, or could use further development, compared to other sites or communities (such as our sister sites within the some category). What do you see as the top three immediate things that you would like to tackle as moderator that you cannot do as a user? Why do you think these points are important and should be prioritized?



Ever since I joined this community, I have seen a lack of community events. I remember there were a few watch parties in my early days, but those have since fade away. I am interested to starting these back up. Community events can provide users another kind of experience that is more than just your typically Q&A.

Back in July, the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4381A&M Monthly Engagement Post #3 was initiated to help move the site forward in implementing upcoming features and changes. Among the three topics, I would focus on organization and cleanup of tags and policies. As mentioned, there are policies that are now deprecated, and these need to be consolidated where needed and have them up-to-date.
For example, let’s look at identification requests. In the help guide, it states questions asking to identify an anime or manga are off-topic regardless of how much information is provided. However, unless you read the meta-posted that is linked to it, you wouldn’t know that anime/manga identification requests based on cosplays or merchandise are accepted. Even though it does say you can ask about merchandise, it’s ambiguous on whether it’s acceptable criteria for identification requests (and cosplay isn’t even mentioned here).

In addition to #2, I would work with the moderator team and community to move forward with making music identification requests off-topic (which has been mentioned in the Anime & Manga engagement questions for both July and May). I have answered a few of these in the past, but I find them tedious and sometimes difficult to answer; especially if the track was unofficially released.
A majority of the time, the OP (original poster) will lack the required information to allow the community effectively answer the question. The question will become unanswered for an indefinite amount of the time because the OP has left the community and leaving the question untouched.
Another thing I would like to mention regarding these questions is that, when provide,
timestamps could be different based on the streaming service they view it on (which I have seen a few times). When this occurs, it could effectively change the track that is being asked about and the community may provide potentially incorrect information – and we wouldn’t know until the OP says otherwise

I am seasoned in the realm of Naruto. A majority of my answers are on questions asking about this series as well as it’s squeal Boruto. While most of my knowledge comes from watching the Anime, I will provide manga references to better support my answers whenever possible. The same is also true for Attack on Titan
I have very little knowledge when it comes to both One Piece and My Hero Academia, however My Hero Academia is next on my to-watch list :)

I do plan on (eventually) watching One Piece, just need to sit down and barrel through it :)


















https://anime.stackexchange.com/election#post-60909Aki Tanaka's answers to the questionnaires
For additional context, https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2525/44325here are my answers to the previous 2019 Android.SE election.


In your opinion, what do moderators do?


Borrowing the terms since then, moderators are "super janitors" and "exception handlers"; "super janitors" because they are basically unrestricted in cleaning up the sites, and "exception handlers" for issues that regular users cannot handle by themselves.
While in general moderators should be the "exception handlers" and let the community moderating the site, Anime.SE doesn't have enough high-rep regulars to moderate efficiently. This is where moderators can support them by being the "janitors".


How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?


In general, I will be quite direct in following and enforcing the https://anime.stackexchange.com/conductCode of Conduct: warning, account suspension, and account expulsion.
However, Anime.SE is lacking experts. Making them left the site because of arguments/flags is the very last action I want to take. With help of other moderators, I'll try best to make a compromise and persuade them to improve their behavior while still reducing/preventing the friction within the community.


How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?


Discuss with them casually but politely, just like how I will do even as a regular user. Our moderators are very rational and open-minded, and I believe we can give feedback to each other constructively without being intimidated. If it is just a single instance of disagreement, then I can live with it ;)
However, if it becomes a pattern, I will request the moderator to discuss the cause of the issue ("focus on the content, not the user") on the meta with the community, just like how regular users can and should do.


What should responsible moderators not do with their power? What behavior have you disliked in moderators (on any SE or elsewhere) that you vow you'll never do?


The obvious one is not abusing their mods' powers, including their binding votes and potentially biased/unreasonable deletion (which might be considered as "censoring") since mods don't really own the site.
Though, I can't remember a specific case for any behavior that I dislike for now...


A user has posted a question which by itself is fine and is answerable, however the user's actions involving the question has been troubling (ie. spamming non-answers, spamming the question link in comments across the site, defacing edits, harassing/abusive behavior to other users who answer/comment/discuss). Along with any possible sanctions against the user, do you think any action should be taken against the question?


SE has a motto to "focus on the content, not the user", which means to moderate each post as isolated as possible without bias from the poster. Depending on the quality/issue of the questions, they should be generally left open to be moderated by the community instead.
Unless, if the question is also a part of the problem (e.g. edit war), it probably needs to be locked, or in the worst case, deleted.


A question was asked https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4314/48808a while back about lowering the close vote threshold from 5 to 3. Since moderator support for such a move is critical, do you think the current threshold is fine or should it be lowered, and why?


It should still be lowered. With one of the candidates being elected, it also means that the site "loses" a regular vote (since mod's votes are binding). I always prefer the community to self-moderate as much as possible rather than relying on moderators.


You (a moderator) and another community member both answer a question on the site. The other answer is well written but (objectively) incorrect, and has gathered a similar amount of upvotes to yours. What do you do?


I'll put my moderator's hat off here and just act as a regular user since this doesn't need any moderator's interventions.
Generally, I'll comment to point out some of the obvious mistakes, and also possibly downvote if it really warrants. Still, I'll disengage if the comment thread may become a long debate since I've already put my answer.
While seeing highly-upvoted wrong answers may be annoying, they are technically an attempt to answer and they aren't really eligible for deletion due to "not an answer". Let the community decide!


Where do you want to see the site and/or community go in the near future? Where don't you want to see it go? (Optional: provide the rationale behind your decisions.)


Honestly, it's hard for me to answer this question since I kind of understand the limitation of SE being a Q&A site. I think, for now, I'll just say that I want to at least keep the quality of the Q&A, being "more factual, and less opinion".


The community as a whole has many things that are can be seen as lack, underdeveloped, or could use further development, compared to other sites or communities (such as our sister sites within the some category). What do you see as the top three immediate things that you would like to tackle as moderator that you cannot do as a user? Why do you think these points are important and should be prioritized?


These are mostly just proposals since these still need to be coordinated with other mods. Also, all of them are related to each other:

Update and organize the site policy as mentioned in the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4381/2516A&M Monthly Engagement Post #3
Update and revise https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/339700/241919the guidance on close reason banner to help each user the best. One of the most used custom reason is "identification request", and the current notice still doesn't seem effective for the poster.
Revise https://anime.stackexchange.com/helpthe introduction text of the help center. There's actually a customizable introduction text between the search box and "Find out more about...". While meta has a problem of discoverability and navigation (even for established users, moreover for new users), mentioning some of the FAQs on there may ease the accessibility.

I have read a few volumes of Naruto, not following One Piece and My Hero Academia at all, and only watched the 1st season of Attack on Titan.
So, while I don't really have much knowledge with the series (or, well, as my profile says "(Googling's) Jack of all trade, (anime/manga) master of none."), I can still try to relate to those Q&A by reading wiki/articles and watching videos, including Japanese resources.
On the other hand, since I'm not putting serious interest in them, I'm okay with facing spoilers (i.e. not afraid to open the Q&A and add spoiler formatting while being "spoiled").

https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/users/63/%d0%ba%d1%8f%ce%b1z%d1%94%d1%8fкяαzєя proposed the original version of the following policy in https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4411/how-should-my-status-as-an-assassin-obviously-exceeds-the-heros-be-tagged/4412#4412this answer. This is an edited version of that proposal.

Since we are an English-language site, we should set up a precedent from now on about tagging:

If the title has an official English localized name, use that. (That means: Use the official English name, where available, rather than the Japanese name.) Both should be synonyms.

If there is no official English name, use the Japanese romanized name until such a time that there is. Once there is an official English name, then merge the existing tag into the English name (i.e. replacing it as the main tag), leaving the Japanese name as a synonym of it. Update the tag excerpt and wiki to reflect as needed.


If the full title exceeds the character limit (currently 35 characters), then:

Use the official (or widely fan-accepted; use search results as a benchmark for this) abbreviated Japanese name or abbreviated English name (if applicable), e.g. Oreimo.

If there is no abbreviated name (official or otherwise), use up to the first 5 words (plus or minus 2, so the title doesn't feel cut off). For instance, in the case of the series My Status as an Assassin Obviously Exceeds the Hero's, the tag could be either https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ansatsusha-de-aruansatsusha-de-aru or https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/my-status-as-an-assassinmy-status-as-an-assassin. The ideal acceptance criteria would be that it is distinguishable by it as a partial title.

Both would be synonyms of one another, with the English name as the main tag (where applicable).

If there ever is an official abbreviated name (or widely accepted name within fan circles, using search results as a benchmark), the tag name can be changed accordingly.

The tag wiki should be updated to reflect abbreviations as needed.



If there is uncertainty or confusion regarding what name should be used for a specific series tag (e.g. very generic names), we can handle such edge cases on a case-by-case basis here on meta.


This should cover around 75% of cases involving series-related tagging.

Correspondingly, I've also removed the quote formatting, though I've kept the credit to кяαzєя for the initial draft. Feel free to look over my edits and roll them back/modify them as needed.

Some general advice: the Help Center articles https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here? (which is site-specific) and https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askWhat types of questions should I avoid asking? (which is a network-wide template) contain most of the things you need to know in order to avoid your question getting closed. The /questions/tagged/off-topicoff-topic and /questions/tagged/scopescope tags often contain questions about the details/edge cases of what is on-topic and off-topic for a site.
If I look at https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/58980/fluffydaboyyour account, I see one duplicate question (you can often, but not always, avoid those by https://anime.stackexchange.com/searchsearching before posting a question), one question which was migrated here to Meta (i.e. this one) and a question which has a negative score but is not closed. You mention "I keep getting my questions closed from the rules" but that must be deleted questions then. I can't see them, and I'm not a regular here so I can't really go into details.
As for the question with negative score, @Turamarth correctly mentions they all came during the https://anime.stackexchange.com/revisions/61976/1first revision of the question which to be honest was quite unclear.

This is fixed as reported https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/361474/235711https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/361474/235711 and https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/10631/14975https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/10631/14975.
I think this predates me breaking things, and was a manifestation of the same bug reported on Code Review.

Some of you may have noticed the Meta Stack Exchange post - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364007/testing-three-vote-close-and-reopen-on-13-network-sitesTesting three-vote close and reopen on 13 network sites (it's linked in the featured on meta sidebar) - we've finally got this project under way and Anime & Manga is one of the sites we'll be running the test on.
Starting tomorrow, I'll be changing the site setting and closing and reopening will require only three votes. This test will run for 45 days and will be turned back to five votes to close and reopen while I review the data from the 13 sites. After we've seen the impact, I'll be posting results and, if there aren't negative impacts, we will change the setting to three permanently.
A few weeks into this, I'll be posting a question here on meta to ask for your thoughts about this change, so you will have an opportunity to discuss the impact.
Thank you so much for your patience while we got this prioritized and scheduled. There's a lot more information in the MSE post, so please review it.

On a more specific note, I did read your answer to my MSE post and I understand your concern. This is on me. When I started this project in earnest in 2019, we were preparing to start running tests in January - and by "we" I mean Shog and I - he's written all of my queries and I'm a novice at best with SQL. And, well... he got fired - and I felt a little stuck because I wasn't sure how to pick up without his help.
Part of the delay in this is just practicality - we had only four CMs and couldn't keep up - and that's why we're finally able to get this out now - it was both prioritized and I felt like I could finally actually do it well. Because that's really important to me and I need to be able to focus on it and really analyze the data I get.
If the mods on this site are closing 98% of all questions that get closed and - even then - y'all still only have 66% of questions that get nominated to close actually handled (these are real stats for y'all)... then there is a big problem and I'm not even sure whether this will fix it. The mods here are doing a lot of great work but if there isn't a community here participating in reviewing, there's a lot bigger problem than this can fix and, well, while I hope this does help a lot, there may be more efficacious options.
One of the other reasons for the delay is that we did https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/360198/visual-design-changes-to-the-review-queuesroll out changes to review in an attempt to get more people involved, help them understand how to review and make reviewing easier - and we didn't want to be testing two changes simultaneously.
As to not responding, that's on my plate, too. I should have - and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364007/testing-three-vote-close-and-reopen-on-13-network-sites#comment1214748_364007a comment I left on the question on MSE specifically recognizes that I've been remiss in keeping people updated, though I did https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/357750/what-is-the-status-of-three-vote-closure-testing-on-non-so-sites/358188#358188write an update answer on MSE to let people know what was going on in December, that wasn't necessarily visible to individual sites. I apologize for that. I struggle with giving people "bad" news ("this project is delayed") - but I'll try to work on that, too.
So, I'm very sorry about the delay in this project and the silence on my part - it is important and I want to find ways to ensure that close-worthy questions are getting closed on sites without putting a ton of pressure on moderators to do all the work.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a lot I want to say about the delay in communication or the priorities of the team, but I don't think it'd do much good at this point.  There's a desire to thank you for the rollout, but there's already a bigger problem afoot with the community and its moderation.  At this point I hope that the community would be motivated enough to partake in this, since I would've imagined that the time that the broader "get this on CM's radar" initiative was probably before the few of us who were here decided to move on and who would've been targeted by this effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(And yes, it took me this long to think of a response that I hope was restrained enough.  I'm hoping it's restrained, at least.)

The rephrasing definitely helps this question to the point I would not consider it a Identification request anymore. However the question seems to pose several different questions, which would make it a fairly broad question which could probably best be split into 2 separate questions.
The questions as posed by the OP in the question:

What is the name of this trope:


I'm trying to get a better grasp on oni symbolism and references, and "oni with a dragon wrapped around their torso" is something I can't find anything about.


What is the meaning of a dragon wrapped around the torso / what does a oni with a dragon around it's waist symbolize?


I'm looking for what it means if an oni has a dragon wrapped around their torso


What is the origin of oni with a dragon wrapped  around them


Question title: What is the origin of oni with a dragon wrapped around them?

Looking at these questions my suggestion would be to combine 1 & 3 into a https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes question:

What is the name of this trope, and where does it come from.

https://anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Btropes%5D+what+is+the+originasking for trope origins and https://anime.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Btropes%5D+what+nameasking for trope names is generally considered on topic.
And a questions that's more focused on https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tropestropes / https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismsymbolism

What does a dragon wrapped around the torso Symbolize

or given that the op is specifically looking for it's symbolism in combinations with demons (oni)

What does a dragon wrapped around the torso of an oni symbolize?

Which also is generally considered https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symbolismon topic

Just wanted to consult regarding reviewing answers flagged as low quality. More often than not, I encounter these answers on review queues for low quality posts:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/4eUSn.png
There are only 3 given actions for these type of answers:

Looks OK - This, however, does not look OK so option 1 is out.
Edit - Option 2 can be picked but for me, I think its kinda hard to edit this without deviating from the author's intent (and if you knew the answer, it might be best to just post an answer instead). Most one can probably do is provide grammar corrections and all but, it would still be a low-quality answer.
Recommend deletion - Option 3 is also a no-go since this post can still be fixed if the OP will edit it. I learned not to be trigger-happy with this option.

My question, then, is: should the option to let the OP know that his answer can use some editing be a valid review action for Low Quality Posts queue?
In First Posts queues, for example, providing a comment to the question/answer to let the OP know of possible improvements for the post would count as an action. The same kind of comment to the item in the Low Quality Posts queue can be provided but then, it will be as if no review has been done on the item since the action done was not among the three choices. So, the queue will still have this item even though the reviewer has already let the OP know the problems in his/her post.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding actions on posts flagged as low qualityb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even if a post is deleted, the poster can edit the post and can get the post undeleted. (Unless a moderator deletes the post, IIRC, then a moderator has to undelete)


















UPDATE: While the testing period has ended, this change has been well-received by the community so we have opted to not reset the votes needed to close/reopen to 5 while we look at data.
Please let me know if you have any concerns about this change in the planned process or if you feel the number of votes should be changed back at least temporarily. I'll be back in a few weeks with the results of the project.

Part of understanding the impact of three-vote closure is to understand what impact it's having on y'all. I'd like to ask anyone who feels up to it to write an answer to this question and to tell us about your experience over the past few weeks.
The sorts of things I'm interested in knowing (feel free to address all or none or add your own) -

Did this help?
Did it hurt?
Did it make you more interested in close/reopen reviewing? Less?

Are there things other than 3-vote close impacting your interest in reviewing?


If you can't vote but do flag, did this make you more/less likely to flag?
Would you prefer to go back to 5?
Should it be permanent?
What would you like me to look into when it comes to analyzing the data from the test?
Were there any side-effects (good or bad) that you want me to be aware of?

These are merely prompts, so feel free to add anything I'm missing that you think is worth saying. This is focused on how you're feeling about it and what data you want me to look at, so don't feel like you need to analyze the data over the last 30 days - though you're welcome to if that's how you figure out what you feel.
If you have any outstanding questions, also feel welcome to ask them here.
The test will run until about Monday the 21st of June, at which point we'll be resetting the votes to close up to 5 while I review the responses here and dig into the data that we've been collecting.

I would say that it's off-topic because it's missing a key detail:
What was the other time that Rasenshuriken was used at close range?
A cursory https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Release:_Rasenshuriken#Developmentmemory refresher suggests that the only battle that this was used before he learned Sage Mode was the first time that he learned the jutsu.
That basically plays to your question about "timeline of the question", in that it's really not clear what timeline other than before Naruto learned to throw it exists, or if there are other battles that it was used in after that.
So with that basis, I would say that it is off-topic because any answers to this would either be based on an incomplete premise (that the OP was only talking about the only known canonical fight), or that the OP is asking an unclear question (that there was more than one fight involving the Rasenshuriken in the time before Senjustu was learned).

Is that correct? If not, what should this be flagged as?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ᴅᴀɴɪᴇʟッ Based in what’s available, “needs more detail or clarity” seems like more appropriate flag


















While looking around old posts on A&M, I've encountered my fair share of comments asking for the OP of the said question to consider accepting their answer. Comments like:

Hi, @(op's username) please upvote this answer if it helped you out :)
Please upvote and accept this answer if its useful! : )

While I do know that accepting and/or upvoting an answer is encouraged if you get a helpful answer to your question, as shown in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answersHelp Center,

Decide if the answer is helpful, and then...
Vote on it (if you have earned the appropriate voting privilege). Vote up answers that are
helpful and well-researched, and vote down answers that are not. Other users will also vote on answers to your question.
Accept it. As the asker, you have a special privilege: you may accept the answer that you believe is the best solution to your problem. (emphasis my own)

do we allow comments about people desperately recommending/asking for the poster of the question to upvote and accept their answer if possible? I feel that this would flood the site with comments of people desperately trying to gain reputation, and thus led to my question:

Are comments of people desperately asking for people to consider accepting their answer to earn reputation discouraged?
What should we do when we encounter these type of comments (if we do)?
If this is discouraged, how should we be flagging these type of comments?


i couldn't find the exact comments, so heres https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/562/how-black-star-was-influenced-by-the-kishins-hallucinations/591#comment743_591one of the related ones, for the record

Once I finished the Review Queues, as explained in the title of this post, nothing shows up when I finish them. Refreshing, nor restarting the website did not fix this problem:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5asl.png
As far as I'm concerned, whenever you finish Review Queues, you usually get a message around the lines of:

Stack Exchange staffs https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/369568/unpinning-the-accepted-answer-from-the-top-of-the-list-of-answers?cb=1recently announced that they are considering the prospect of unpinning the accepted answer from the top of answers and instead sort them by votes. I noticed some of the other communities discussing this on their meta sites, so I thought of initiating a discussion on Anime & Manga Meta too.
This setting will be configurable per site. The default setting will be fixed according to the preference of the majority among the Stack Exchange Network. The staffs requested to discuss this question within individual communities and they are going to collect the feedback before the end of September 19th.
Does the Anime and Manga community want the accepted answer to be unpinned, or to stay pinned as it currently is?

I say let it be unpinned.
Quite frankly, if there is more than one answer on a question, especially on something like Anime or Manga, I would honestly say that it's fine to let other answers that the community thinks are better float to the top as opposed to the one that the OP thought was best at the time.

To be fair the accepted answer is quite good and well-detailed, but there aren't as many people around actively upvoting this kind of content.  This is an important canary to indicate as well, in my assessment.


















I noticed during a conversation with https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/59761User ᴅᴀɴɪᴇʟッ under a post of mine that the last character ッ does not appear in the autocompletion when I start my comment with @ to ping them. Most probably this is because ッ doesn't come from a "standard" Roman script? I believe the pings are going through, but the best person to confirm or deny this would be ᴅᴀɴɪᴇʟッ.
One can test this by picking any comment by ᴅᴀɴɪᴇʟッ from their https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/59761?tab=activity&sort=commentsactivity page to reply to. (Of course, there is no need to actually post a comment to test this, so I'm not inviting spam to rain down on them. I hope.)

Yes, the pings do come to me. It is pretty weird though, how the last character is left off when someone is trying to @ me (in a posts comments). Nonetheless, I do get the ping, so this ain't much of an issue.
This is especially weird because when I was talking with user @Makoto on MSE, the ッ is there. And when I'm in chat, and get pinged, it's there is well (https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/6697/conversation/chat-with-peilonrayzhere is an example conversation). Kinda weird for it to just not show up on A&M.
I do not participate on too many SE sites, and I've only noticed this on A&M. I do see the ッ on other Stack Exchange networks though.
I doubt this is from it being a special character,since every part of my username is.

But on the main and meta sites, I'm not seeing the final character in the autocompletion. Huh!


















This is possibly an artifact of the older markdown engine https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/348746/241919before the CommonMark migration.
This is easy to check since the post wasn't migrated automatically by the Community bot due to the different rendering results:

Before CommonMark: 2 spoiler blocks nested inside
After CommonMark: 1 spoiler block


We avoid breaking existing posts by erring on the side of safety. If a post looks different using the new renderer (and if it’s just one whitespace off) we won’t automatically re-render the post and put it up for investigation first. This way we can be sure that all changes are safe.
[...]
Things might get funky when you're editing a post that renders differently with the new CommonMark renderer. Again, if we detected that a post would look differently when rendered with the new CommonMark renderer during the migration, we wouldn't save a new version of this post as part of the migration. This way, all posts continue to look the same when being viewed. However, once someone comes in and edits it, it will be rendered using the new CommonMark renderer and this might cause the post to look slightly different than what we had before. This will only be a small fraction of all of our posts, and of that small fraction a smaller fraction will actually be edited moving forward. However, it's important to keep in mind that editing old posts has a slight chance that you run into differences between our old and our new markdown renderers.

As such, re-editing the post to use CommonMark and fixing the markdown is recommended.

For more details:


Even without clicking on "Reveal spoiler", the last line of the answer is visible, despite the fact that the last line is placed inside the spoiler block (check the source formatting of the second revision to confirm).


https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/347955/241919Status by-design.


After clicking on "Reveal spoiler", the line before the blockquote is revealed, whereas the blockquote is still not revealed, and a new "Reveal spoiler" button appears over the blockquoted part. At the same time, some portion of the blockquote is revealed, namely " --- Quoted from " and the full stop at the end of the sentence, a little distance away. The part between "from" and the full stop is a link, and it is hidden at this point.

After clicking on "Reveal spoiler" a second time, the entire answer is revealed properly.



Fixed in CommonMark; only 1 spoiler block remains.


Oddly enough, the spoiler formatting seems to work properly in the revision history of the answer, under the "Inline" as well as "Side-by-side" views.


(not sure; spoiler block is not a standard markdown. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bug%2bspoilers%2bmarkdown?tab=NewestIts interaction with other markdowns are often buggy)


For more weirdness, go to the link to the second revision. Here, the last line starts out unhidden, just as on the main answer under the question. However, clicking on "Reveal spoiler" just once opens the rest of the answer, unlike what happens on the main answer.


Presumably rendered with the current CommonMark, as observed with 2) and 3).

There's no use cases of https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kanojo-okarishimasukanojo-okarishimasu, so why would we synthetically create it?  I don't see that there's a need right now.

Am I mistaken?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're probably not but I don't see a reasonable way to synonymize a tag that doesn't exist.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was under the impression moderators have some magic powers to take care of this. ;) If it would help, I can create the tag [kanojo-okarishimasu] and shoot off a couple of questions under it. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't want you to artificially create the tag if the Correct™ one exists already.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All right-y. :)


















Currently, the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kyoukai-no-kanatakyoukai-no-kanata is the parent tag, and it has the synonym https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/beyond-the-boundarybeyond-the-boundary. Can we reverse the direction of the synonym to make the parent tag as the one with the English title? I think this would be in line with the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4414current policy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we reverse the direction of the synonym between the tags [kyoukai-no-kanata] and [beyond-the-boundary]?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5BTW, please feel free to let me know if I'm posting these requests too rapidly. My impression is that since there's no hurry to handle these requests, it's better to just make a post once I come across a possible improvement in synonymization instead of waiting and then forgetting about it. But if it's bothersome to see a bunch of these on the front page of Meta then I can slow down.


















This is a work-in-progress proposal in revising the https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp/on-topic page. Feel free to discuss/raise an idea in the comment section below, or post a new answer if the change is major.

Change proposal:

Redirect "retag" to the "Ask a Question" page with 'retag' tag prefilled: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=retaghttps://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=retag
Redirect "appropriate privilege" to the "Privileges - Create new tags" help page: https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagshttps://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tags
Change "put on hold" to "closed"
Redirect identification-related links to the newer policy: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2805/what-wed-like-to-do-about-those-gosh-darn-identification-requests-questionsWhat we'd like to do about those gosh darn "identification requests" questions

Currently, the first bullet point uses italics for emphasis, as well as for the example sentence, as well as the suggestion for where to take such questions. The other bullet points use bold for emphasis, italics for the example sentences, and also for suggestions (mostly). Some links to Meta discussions are displayed in full, whereas others are behind some text: again, a consistent format of "See: " would be nice. Sorry for being pedantic! (:b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the idea of having the text "retag" link to the Ask a Question page with that tag prefilled. We should definitely link to the newer policy on ID requests, too.


















If I'm not mistaken, the series "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37984/Kumo_Desu_ga_Nani_kaKumo Desu ga, Nani ka?" has the official English title, "So I'm a Spider, So What?" Can we create the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/so-im-a-spider-so-whatso-im-a-spider-so-what and make https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kumo-desu-ga-nani-kakumo-desu-ga-nani-ka its synonym? I think this would be in line with the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4414/2021-policy-review-how-do-we-want-to-name-series-tagscurrent policy on tagging.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we create the tag [so-im-a-spider-so-what] and make the tag [kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka] its synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Separately, I'm not sure whether it should be "nani-ka" or "nanika" in the tag for the Japanese title (or whether it doesn't really matter). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_I%27m_a_Spider,_So_What%3F) gives the Hepburn transliteration of the title as "Nanika", but MAL (linked in the post) gives "Nani ka".


















I'm wondering why https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/first-answers/68927the 'First answers' review item for an https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/65906answer by https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/63231/cordel-michaelCordel Michael to 'https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/13811Can Kakashi use the jutsu he copied without the Sharingan?' is invalidated, as shown in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/posts/65906/timelinetimeline for the post.
The timeline shows that the answer was not modified (no edits/deletion/undeletion) after posting. It is possible that some modification might have happened during the https://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/grace-period/info5 minute edit grace period, but I believe even if it were so it couldn't have invalidated the review item based on the rules for invalidation as well as the timeline of events on this post.

The 'First answers' review item was created at 2021-11-13 03:50:56Z, simultaneously with the creation of the post. It was invalidated around 36 minutes later at 2021-11-13 04:26:45Z.

The corresponding 'Late answers' review item was created at 2021-11-13 04:10:20Z, which is around 20 minutes after the post was created1. This review item  was not invalidated, since https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/late-answers/68928I was able to complete the review around 2 hours 50 minutes later at 2021-11-13 06:40:40Z.

I have looked at the following posts on https://meta.stackexchange.com/Meta Stack Exchange, but none of the reasons given there seem to be applicable here:

From 'https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/190581When is a review task "completed" or "invalidated"?':

If the review task is removed due to other circumstances outside the queue (e.g. a moderator deletes a post that is being reviewed, outside the queue), it is marked "invalidated" or "no longer reviewable".


From 'https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/369431/when-does-a-first-post-review-get-invalidated?noredirect=1&lq=1#comment1232694_369431When does a first post review get invalidated?':

Posts more than 14 days old were not eligible for the first posts queue.


From 'https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/369765Do posts in the first answers and first questions queues age out?':

Review tasks in both First questions and First answers are invalidated in any of the following cases:

14 days elapse since the CreationDate of the post
The score of the post is >= 3
For answers, if the post owner rep goes over 250
Post deleted
Question closed



From 'https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/361253First posts escape review when user deletes and undeletes post':

[I]t seems to be possible to avoid your first post from being reviewed simply by deleting it, waiting a few minutes (until the review item becomes invalidated) and undeleting it.





So, why was this 'First answers' review item invalidated?

1: This makes sense since an eligible post cannot enter the 'Late answers' queue before 15 minutes from the time of its creation, and the process that sends it to the queue runs approximately once every 5 minutes (https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/220420/review-update-pattern/220431#220431source).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was this review item in the 'First answers' queue invalidated?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps related, on Meta SE: [Why were the First Answers and Low Quality Posts reviews for this answer invalidated for no apparent reason?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/382255)


















Since I don't have edit privileges (yet), when I select the option to edit a post in the review queue, my edit gets submitted as a suggested edit, and the review completion actions modal updates to display "Pending edit".
This option is not selectable when I'm in the review queues on my laptop — which is the appropriate behavior, in my opinion.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/4O05P.png

However, when I'm using the review queues on my mobile (in the responsive design), I am able to tap on "Pending edit" and a tick mark appears to show that the option is selected. However, nothing happens when I then try to click on "Submit" to complete the review.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ivdHSl.png

This is confusing. It would be better if one of the following changes is made:

the "Pending edit" option is completely hidden, or
the "Pending edit" option is visible, but not selectable, or
an appropriate error message shows up when selecting "Pending edit" and trying to click on "Submit".


To clarify, this happens only when I click on the "edit" action link beneath the post. When I instead use the "Edit" option in the review actions modal on the right sidebar, the review is completed immediately upon submitting the suggested edit.
I did not realize this earlier, because I had never used the second option before. Perhaps this is no more a bug, I'm not sure… I also found the following request on Meta SE to remove the "edit" action link beneath the post: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/369208User Tomerikoo's answer to "Review queue workflows - Final release", currently marked /questions/tagged/status-reviewstatus-review. If that is implemented, it would take care of the issue mentioned in this post as well.

This question asks for the font used in subtitles:
https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/65949/102What's the EXACT Japanese subtitle font used in Evangelion bluray?
I'm not convinced that this isn't analogous to the other kinds of identification questions about characters out there, but I wanted to see what others thought of this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is identifying font used in anime or manga on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, I have a tendency to make it off-topic, but my current reasonings may not be so convincing. FWIW, our sister site [graphicdesign.se] accepts [font identification](https://graphicdesign.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1083/30985).


















This is a typical identification question and should be closed due to lack of information and context, even if it wasn't one. It should be still closed in my opinion due to lack of context.
It lacks critical information on which bluray it's from, particularly its country of origin. There are many different blurays for many different countries for many different versions and cuts of Evangelion.
Depending on how the media is player, different media players may use different (default) fonts, unless the subs were hard-coded (which is unlikely unless it was a rip). Therefore, it might be a user-specific issue and not be answerable without proper content.
If one is asking for exact information, then exact details should be provided. We're not a visual font identification service. Information should flow both ways.
I feel that these types of questions will always be  regarded as being tertiary in regards to the series, its content, its staff, and its productions. A question comparing the ADV subtitles to the Netflix subtitles of original Evangelion would likely be more on-topic than this question.
Just like how we don't identify anime cels (it's an image id-req) or do stuff in regards to music composition (something better left to those more adept to music theory).
If we get questions asking us to find something that does not correspond to content directly (i.e. series/franchise-specific, character-specific, VA-specific, series/character design-specific) or its production (behind-the-scenes details (made-up languages in the series), its staff, history [i.e., extra lore from data books], promotional material, etc) without a given reason or purpose (e.g., I'm trying to find X because of Y): We should be closing these questions without a second thought.
That's not to say all request for information and resources should be off-topic - but if the asker can't provide sufficient context on what or why they are looking for something, we should not be taking the time to fill in their blanks.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. My (vague) feeling is that this particular question reads like a "[boat programming](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19478/the-many-memes-of-meta/19487#19487)" question. Its relevance towards the anime/manga, or towards its appreciation, is not at all clear.

Currently, the tag https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kenka-banchou-otomekenka-banchou-otome is the parent tag, and it has the synonym https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/girl-beats-boysgirl-beats-boys. Can we reverse the direction of the synonym to make the parent tag as the one with the English title? I think this would be in line with the https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4414/2021-policy-review-how-do-we-want-to-name-series-tagscurrent policy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we reverse the direction of the synonym between the tags [kenka-banchou-otome] and [girl-beats-boys]?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm, upon further consideration, it is not clear to me that "Girl Beats Boys" is really the English title, and not a subtitle for the anime series. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenka_Bancho_Otome:_Girl_Beats_Boys) offers "Fighting Delinquents Girl Leader", but I can't find this title in use anywhere other than in the Wikipedia article. [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34501/Kenka_Banchou_Otome__Girl_Beats_Boys) doesn't list it, for instance. Perhaps it would be more accurate to create [tag:kenka-banchou-otome-girl-beats-boys] instead? This fits in the 35 character limit.


















This is a bit complicated.
Kenka Banchou Otome is actually a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_mixmedia mix. In this case, the Kenka Banchou Otome series originally started as https://otome-games.fandom.com/wiki/Kenka_Bancho_Otomea PS Vita game. Later in 2015, a manga titled https://otome-games.fandom.com/wiki/Kenka_Bancho_Otome_%EF%BD%9EKoi_no_Battle_Royal%EF%BD%9EKenka Banchou Otome ～Koi no Battle Royal～ (also known as https://www.viz.com/kenka-bancho-otome-love-s-battle-royaleKenka Bancho Otome: Love's Battle Royale) was published. Then in 2017, an anime adaptation titled https://www.crunchyroll.com/kenka-bancho-otome-girl-beats-boys-Kenka Bancho Otome -Girl Beats Boys- was broadcast.
However, looks like Viz licensed the series as Kenka Bancho Otome: Girl Beats Boys instead? As per https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-07-01/viz-media-adds-fire-punch-and-kenka-bancho-otome-girl-beats-boys-manga-sisyphean-novel/.118276an article on AnimeNewsNetwork and https://twitter.com/vizmedia/status/881261710048362496a tweet by Viz when they licensed the "Love's Battle Royale" manga,

Announcement! @ShojoBeat has acquired Kenka Bancho Otome: Girl Beats Boys!

As such, I'm still not sure if using Viz's naming as the tag makes sense in this case since the subtitle for the manga is actually different.

With a new year, comes a new start. Throughout the past year, we've been pondering about better distributions of our current policies and what to do with specific questions. In the back of our minds, the music identification question continues to remain unpopular. The sentiment is mostly a mix of dislike and apathy. After much back and forth, we've finally decided to deprecate these questions in the community as they've become ever so unpopular.
The plan:

Edit ID-request close reason to include a note and meta link about it (basically add a link to this meta post)
Close all future music ID questions as we do regular ID-requests

What do we do about other types of identification questions? While these types of questions are unpopular. There's still meaning in identifying references within a particular series, franchise, or subculture as a whole. A recent example is: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/66014/where-is-this-pool-fromWhere is this pool from?.
The above reference identification is a reasonable one as it is a recurring reference that more casual watchers/readers might be in the dark about. These things might be common knowledge within the more established or cultured connoisseurs of anime and manga content, but anime and manga these days are not as niche as they used to be. The proliferation of live-action adaptations (albeit of questionable quality) really shows that anime and manga are making strides to break the audience barrier these days. We hope to welcome some of the more neophyte consumers of the content, so allowing these types of questions with succinct references could be beneficial to more users than one-off questions about an uncertain clip of music.
However, questions like https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/65949/whats-the-exact-japanese-subtitle-font-used-in-evangelion-blurayWhat's the EXACT Japanese subtitle font used in Evangelion Bluray? (already deleted) will be closed and require a statement of how this related to the topic of anime and manga as a whole before they can be reopened. The same thing with identifying things like cosplay, as not all cosplay is related to anime.
The reason why these questions are acceptable over questions like music identification is because the soundtracks aren't always available when a series premieres, sometimes the tracks remain unreleased and uncredited. Fans can give names to these tracks but rarely are they consistent about it. Oftentimes, these questions remain unanswerable until the particular season's soundtrack is released. Leaving them unanswered for a significant amount of time causes them to become lost and forgotten, eventually causing them to be buried until the Community bot bumps it.
Furthermore, references to timecodes seem to be all over the place as some watchers get their content from less than legitimate sources which may exclude content like openings and ending or localized sources which may edit the content to some extent, throwing off time code references. For the most part, we're not able to catch these nuisances or get the OP to respond to questions of clarification, so these questions are left blowing in the wind without a shred of attention to be made towards them.
While we're moving to depreciate these questions, we'll still be open to a venue to salvage these types of questions if possible (at a later time if something does come out of it), but only if there is significant support from the community to curate these music identification question, but personally from past feedback, the community as a whole doesn't see them as beneficial towards the community.
Please leave your thoughts and let us know what you guys think. We're looking to steer the community in a more favorable direction and clean up and streamline things in this coming new year.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So it's about time we (finally) deprecated music ID-request questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you! I am fully supportive of this changeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have tried to become somewhat "regular" on this site and every time I see the homepage cluttered with song-identification and anime-identification questions mostly being bumped by community bots. I know song identification question are hard as it takes a good time pinpoint the exact song as sometimes it is normally not available due to copyright rules. I am of the opinion that if anime identification is off-topic then song-identification should also be off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FumikageTokoyami when I first joined the site, I thought music identification requests were fun because I got to listen to a bunch of tracks. Now, just as you said, the home page is cluttered to the point I can’t stand them anymore. Additionally, most questions are asked by one-time guest users who never visits the site again. So the question just sit there either unanswered or unaccepted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5personally, i have [no strong feelings one way or the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ussCHoQttyQ) (dam this really doesnt hit the same after youtube removed dislikes :/)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please have community user stop bumping music questions?


















I mistakenly locked this question as part of ongoing depreciation of music id-request. Regardless it should have been closed as opinionated.
This straddles the link in acceptable opinionated questions related to music. You have a 3 second clip with a riff that you presume sample the "Eye of the Tiger" song. The clip sample size provides hardly any evidence to justify that it was sampled, inspired or otherwise copied from the alleged original song. While it's true that there are music thare draw inspiration from other works for effect (as in not a near exact copy of the riff), the evidence you provide does not make this connection or does it explain why you believe it to be so. So in lack of any clear evidence to support your case, the question is based on your subjected assumptions rather than evidently explained facts.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok thanks for the clarification. Re 'The clip sample size provides hardly any evidence to justify that it was sampled, inspired or otherwise copied from the alleged original song' --> Well if there was some Japanese article out there then probably. I read some comments that say 'it is the same chord progression.' I'll edit post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While true, good chord combinations/archetypes are limited so there will be instances where one piece has a similar progression as another. Anything beyond that fact requires a longer sample for comparison.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5кяαzєя Cool. Thanks. We're so lucky to have a mod who knows music and stuff here. So how many seconds for the sample?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It depends. It's like comparing vocal patterns to see if people sound alike. Sometimes it's simple when you have same phrase, but can be difficult with different phrases/pitches/tones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are no lyrics here...soooo...?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Overall it's not a good question to ask if you cannot establish that your point is not just something in your head (i.e., your own opinion). It could be intentional but it could be coincidental. The burden of proof is for you to establish the connection with a convincing argument and not something like because I think so. I've listed scenarios and examples in the comment of your question for context.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5кяαzєя seems like a little catch-22. If I come up with some connection, then it's like the answer already. What if there's some Japanese article out there on this which I simply can't find because my google search is in English?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not. The site prefers facts over speculation. If you have a hypothesis you want to ask about. Present your thesis and explain why you think so instead of claiming it is so because you think it is so. Personal bias makes for bad, subjective questions. Furthermore you cannot assume something exists before you find it. Japanese articles aren't all knowing or all encompassing (the internals of anime and manga production is still a niche topic, despite it's popularity of it's metaculture). Unless it comes from an author's give source close to the production it's just hearsay.


















Note: I have nothing against any user. They are free to ask any question about any show as long as they are on-topic.

Suppose X is an anime. Consider it a light hearted slice-of-life show meant for casual watch and occasionally throw jokes for giggles. Now, if I want to discuss something about the show, for e.g. "why is this phrase used in this joke?" or "why is this character holding this thing while delivering the joke?" or "why is this character wearing this costume at this time of the year?", this could ruin the show considering it is just a casual show not meant for analyzing any minute details.
I get some users will not understand something and they are free to here but then again if we were to discuss each and every bit of the show, that will lead to the site being an open ended discussion forum rather than a proper Q&A site (Do note that some shows are plot heavy and sometimes confusing like NGE, Naruto etc. and it is inevitable that somebody will ask questions on this type of show).
It seems like a rant but my genuine question is: Is it ok to overanalyze an anime?
Tangentially related: https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/668/is-it-ever-acceptable-to-ask-about-whether-an-anime-event-is-realistic-or-plausiIs it ever acceptable to ask about whether an anime event is realistic or plausible?

I have seen so many questions in the last few months that I (personally) have considered really over-the-top coming from this perspective. @Dimitrimx [This](https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/64207/20275) is one I remember which I considered overanalyzed (sorry Pablo if you're reading this :))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dimitrimx recent questions from Kaguya-sama-love-is-warb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Wondercricket thanks for the example, I've closed that one with a link to the "realistic or plausible post" mentioned above. As I agree, that question is strongly over analyzed. Anime is (usually) not based in/on reality in such a way. And we should not assume it to be so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OMG is this about me? I saw this in hot meta '
Is it ok to overanalyze an anime?' and then the post says 'a light hearted slice-of-life show meant for casual watch and occasionally throw jokes for giggles'. Edit: 'recent questions from Kaguya-sama-love-is-war' --> HAHAHAHAHA LOL ok it's definitely about me then right? XDb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have 2 more questions for you. 1 - Why do you have to bring genre into this? [This](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/26618/was-misa-accessible-to-light-in-the-way-that-this-proposition-assumes) kind of question for Death Note it's fine, but when it comes to Kaguya-sama, there's an issue? Perhaps your question should be like is it ok to overanalyse comedy anime or a joke in an anime. 2 - Kaguya-sama is supposed to be like Death Note/Kaiji/Akagi but applied to romance right? (They've got red vs blue, and they've got a narrator...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi @BCLC. Just to make myself clear, I am not throwing any personal attacks here. If I had issues with your questions, then I would have asked "why BCLC is asking such type of questions?". I am asking as a general question and it's nothing to do with you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, I also follow the show. Being a non speaker of Japanese language, I also find some jokes difficult to understand because subtitle doesn't do justice, but that doesn't mean I'll go and ask "why the character used this phrase?" everytime I'll get confused. But then again it's your choice and nobody is stopping you to ask such questions, at least not me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fumikage Tokoyami, oh yeah I know it's not a personal attack. (I even upvoted your post.) But what made you think of this question was my questions right? XDb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Power scalers overanalyze anime to death


















Personally, I would say that overanalyzing is not good, but analyzing is.
Especially in the more casual shows, jokes and comedy are often hidden in the minute details. These require the viewer to have a decent, if not good understanding of either Japanese, Japanese culture, and sometimes even both. Those kind of questions can either be a hit or miss, as the answer may just be "there is no special meaning here"
However the premise, phrasing, and scope of a question is really important.
For example: "why is this phrase used in this joke?" 
The title implies that there is some context as to why it's strange, or out of place that a certain phrase is used within a joke. In the question body it's reasonable to expect the OP gives some context as to why they consider this out of place or strange.
If no such context is given, it's reasonable to ask for additional details. And if non such are given, or the reason given is strongly opinionated we have the close reason Needs details or clarity.
The other end of this being "Why is this phrase used" which would be too broad, and could also be closed as such.
Off course there will always be edge cases. In those scenario's feel free to reach out and see what others in the community think. You can do so via a meta post addressing the particular post, or drop by in the chat to discuss the post in question with other community members.

I would personally reverse the purpose, but, yes, questions should always mention the specific source/reference as context if possible, at least on the body. (The title is sometimes too verbose for this, and not everything is a spoiler).
Source/reference is one of the most important contexts for readers/future answerers so that they can cross-check the canonical info with the premise of the question.
Avoiding spoilers is just an additional benefit since the spoiler can then be hidden  without losing too much context for the question to make sense, and also work both as a warning, and hopefully, as an eye-catcher.

Happy Easter!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Andrew [in the most recent revision the last part (after 'Could anyone explain it to me?')](https://anime.stackexchange.com/revisions/36258/5) doesn't say what exactly is being spoiled. Like for all we know it's spoiling some future thing beyond episode 11. Should it maybe? or idk...maybe it's understood to be part of episode 11 spoilers only?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's the spoiling question up until episode 11 (what the OP has given as the context). I don't see any need to be too verbose.


















Actually you didn't (directly? explicitly?) answer my question

Why do you have to bring genre into this? This kind of question for Death Note it's fine, but when it comes to Kaguya-sama, there's an issue? Perhaps your question should be like is it ok to overanalyse comedy anime or a joke in an anime.

But anyway...
My obviously biased answer to your question, which I find good and which I upvoted, is

I note your example is comedy anime.

What I understand of the term 'overanalyse' here is applying the way 1 would analyse a drama anime to a comedy anime.

And to say that if it's ok to 'overanalyse'/analyse a drama anime, then there shouldn't be an issue in 'overanalysing' a comedy anime...unless there's something up specifically with comedy anime, that I may have overlooked.


Note: For the case of dramedy anime...I guess it's about the specific question like if it's about a comedic or a dramatic part of the anime.
Happy Easter!

Edit 1: Ah, unexplained downvotes because of my arrogance when they actually agree with me. Interesting.....
FYI Shaymin Gratitude answered after I mentioned this meta post here: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/62274/has-miko-inos-morality-been-corrupted#comment79010_62275Has Miko Ino's morality been corrupted? (where Shaymin Gratitude self-answers a question about Miko Iino from Kaguya-sama).

Edit 2: About Kaguya-sama and Death Note:

Also at first, he wanted to do more intellectual battles like Death Note but the theme changed more to "clashing of romantic emotions".


Edit 2.1: This is what OP says


Yes, definitely both show started on the right note on having intellectual battles

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have just read your answer and let me answer your question that here: I intentionally chose comedy/SoL anime because there is nothing to be asked. They are made just for casual watch and not meant to be taken seriously. I am pretty sure the author didn't thought of this much while making the anime. Surely, some things are left unexplained for us to speculate, so should we go ahead and ask, "what's the joke here?". Why does it matter to discuss a character's height? Why does it matter that the character did this and not this? It's pure fiction and let it that way (I didn't downvote btw)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for Kaguya sama, at this point you have almost asked around 20 questions (I didn't count). You have almost took the show to absolute limit and took the skeleton out of show. I am very sure, the author didn't thought of that much. Maybe you want to contact the author if he ever has writer's block. (Don't take this seriously, I am seeing the funnier side of things)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FumikageTokoyami Anyway, so why don't you edit your post to ask what you really mean: about comedy anime ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FumikageTokoyami Wait what about 1 - https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/62274/has-miko-inos-morality-been-corrupted ? 2 - Kaguya-sama is supposed to be like Death Note/Umineko/Kaiji/Akagi but applied to romance right? (They've got red vs blue like Death Note/Umineko, and they've got a narrator like Kaiji/Akagi...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51. For that post, you can talk to Shaymin. 2. Why are comparing Kaguya and DN? One is romcom and other is a psychothriller with murderous intent. Just because both has psychology involved, that doesn't mean you can say they are similar. C'mon leave Kaguya alone. It is supposed to be a casual show.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FumikageTokoyami 'Also at first, he wanted to do more intellectual battles like Death Note but the theme changed more to "clashing of romantic emotions".' What do you say to this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't want to engage in this discussion anymore but Kaguya and DN are two different show. Yes, definitely both show started on the right note on having intellectual battles, but the theme changed. Now, Kaguya is nowhere near to DN.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FumikageTokoyami 'Yes, definitely both show started on the right note on having intellectual battles' Ah yes. Exactly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FumikageTokoyami Is this overanalysis? [Does Kaguya actually have doubt about Miyuki Shirogane? I thought the whole point of the series is there should be no doubt. (S03E08)](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/66850/does-kaguya-actually-have-doubt-about-miyuki-shirogane-i-thought-the-whole-poin) (I assume you will focus on not the length but the purpose of the question itself.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dimitri mx, is it targeting if it's a compliment? Lol. I think Shaymin Gratitude will take it as a compliment, but maybe for others who don't like overanalysing anime they will see it as that I'm insulting Shaymin Gratitude. But Shaymin Gratitude and I know I am complimenting Shaymin Gratitude


















Honestly I'm just happy that people are asking questions about anime on the site.
This is way too much hand wringing IMO; we're not getting into a situation where the questions are explicitly and blatantly off-topic, and there can be answers for them that do have some kind of benefit for those who are curious.
When it becomes a problem, I think we'll know about it.  But for now, I'm content with letting sleeping dogs lie on this.

I think this sounds like something you'd say if this site hasn't, what's the term, 'graduated' (?) from beta, but this site has, soooo...?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BCLC:  Yes, but traffic on this site that *wasn't* just localized to identifying some *thing* from an anime is virtually nonexistent.  So, seeing someone talk about anime in this capacity is a refreshing break from the norm.  Again I stress - once it's actually a *problem* we should do something about it, but so far I haven't personally seen it raise to the level of "problem" such that it's choking off other legitimate traffic or draining attention away from other questions.


















I am not the moderator who declined the flag, but as a mod, I would do the same by declining the flag for the same reason.
Basically, you are misusing the mod flag when there is already a standard flag to close the question: flag - needs improvement - A community-specific reason - Identification reasons (all flags under "needs improvement" will put the question in the https://anime.stackexchange.com/review/closeclose votes review queue).
The process of closing music ID questions does not really need a mod, and moreover, it is not that critical that a mod needs to handle it quickly. However, by using a mod flag, the standard process of getting it to the close votes review queue (which then can be handled by the community and also the mods) is bypassed and go straight to the mod-only flag queue, which is unnecessary.
Please just use the standard flag from now on, and let the community handle it.

Currently, we have an /questions/tagged/allowed-topicsallowed-topics tag which is to be utilized for questions about which topics are, well, allowed:

Questions about which topics are permitted / in scope on this site.

However, the /questions/tagged/off-topicoff-topic tag encompasses this already:

This tag is for questions regarding off topic questions, including whether a question is on topic and what to do with off topic questions. [1]

Doesn't this make the /questions/tagged/allowed-topicsallowed-topics tag redundant?
1: Emphasis mine.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the allowed-topics tag redundant?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also noticed that there's an [tag:acceptable-questions] tag, perhaps this is redundant too? I can create a separate post with a proposition for reducing redundancy, but it will depend on the answer to this question.

It makes little difference either way. When determining consider how "spoiled" someone would be I knew the information in advance. What is considered a spoiler is extremely subjective, the context it is made is important, otherwise everything can be considered a spoiler.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So this new title somehow doesn't convey the context enough? People know it's kaguya-sama from the tag and that some character gives another a present. What else is there that needs to be known?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Spoilers are subjective. We can't reasonablely cross every t and dot every i. Nor can we force everyone to follow a certain policy with an iron fist. Generally spoiler things are applied to thing that will give away the entire plot or major sections if known. But this can vary by media movies having the most immediate impact and novels having a bit less impact due to the size of their audience bases and how easy it is to consume that particular mediab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5кяαzєя, I believe you didn't answer my question. I know you have this thing where you have to balance spoilers and context, and so my question is really about context. What's lacking in context with my title?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't believe spoilers are subjective. r/anime and many reddit subs have a policy simply to make sure your non-spoiler tagged stuff, ESP TITLES, are accessible to a 1st time viewer of the 1st few episodes. What you're doing here is saying that Kaguya is going to give a fan to Miyuki when really at the start of the episode Kaguya hasn't decided. Of course if the whole question post is already spoiler tagged talking about say s2 finale, then the answers don't need to be spoiler tagged as long as they don't contain info from s3 onwards. If I scroll anime stackexchange, then I will be spoiled.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are not them and they are not us. What they do is their business. If everything is a spoiler to you then you'll need to look to yourself for introspective. It's unfortunate but we cannot capitulate to your request as not all of this revolves around what you want. The consensus of the greater part of the active community takes precedence.


















The question is in context to names in Japan in relation to the series. The tag here is relevant to Japanese culture in general.

As long as it pertains to culture in relation to anime/manga you can ask about culture depicted in other countries besides Japan. I.e. for culture/customs of Brazil from a series that has a setting in that country. The Japan tag can be tagged about events related to anime and manga in Japan. Such as pilgirmages to locations in Japan featured in prominently in anime or mnga


















In Science Fiction SE, they have a Physics tag so you can ask something related to Physics in the context of a science fiction. I imagine that if I open such a question in Anime SE without a Physics tag, someone is going to say that's a question for Physics SE, where it would likely get closed. The alternative is to post it in the Science Fiction SE under the Physics and Anime tags, but it would be a shame to lose some of those questions to another SE in my opinion.
Can we have a Physics tag in Anime SE?

 Why did this character lose their memories?

But for me I even find

spoilerous. I prefer

Why did this character forget?

Again you can https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2654/should-this-question-have-avoided-spoilers-in-the-title-or-notalways say the real title at the start of the body:

Keep in mind that when you google for an answer to some anime-related question, google indexes both the title and the body of the post, so stuff is still findable even if you're somewhat roundabout in the title. While I imagine the title is granted more weight, avoiding spoilers in the title still likely does little harm. I think that the benefit of avoiding spoiling users' experience with various shows outweighs the cost of losing some descriptiveness in the titles.

It's been a long road, getting from though beta to here. It's been a long time, through the good and the bad. Our time is finally here. It's been 10 years.
Let's take a look back at all we've been through and share it with the rest of the SE community in celebration. In the month of November, Stack Exchange will be doing a blog celebrating communities that have made it this far, like they did in https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/27/celebrating-the-stack-exchange-sites-that-turned-ten-years-old-in-spring-2022/the spring.
We'd like to ask the community for things they'd like mentioned or shared. It can be anything from your favorite questions/answers, post/tags, personal stories or anecdotes (good or bad) related to the site and community. It's nothing much but we'd like to share a bit of the community in our celebration banner, as it's what we'd consider the best and most important part of our site.
The content will be like a blog blurb about the community. The banners for the celebration will be live for the month of November, feel free to leave your comments or stories as answers and we'll do what we can to weave it into a narrative to share as part of our celebration banner. Feel free to leave any bits you want here. We'll try to take as much as we can. The deadline for us submitting things is October 20th to the SE Community. We'd appreciate if you can get anything to by the 18th so we can come up with something.
The winds blowing through landscape of anime and manga and it's subculture has changed significantly through these years. Through effort and perseverance we've made it to where we are. There's not much that will hold us back anymore. I got faith in the community. Don't let anything hold us back.
Anyways, did you know there is a new Bunny Girl Senpai anime coming soon? https://twitter.com/aobuta_anime/status/1573643420689584129?s=20&t=6E9-DxpTGK2Cr6VQ0AjgrAMore details to be revealed soon.

When I first started using this site, I raised a flag that was later deemed as unhelpful. I now know this was because I had used the incorrect flag type (being 'requires moderator intervention' rather than 'needs improvement'), but was given this text as the reason:

Using standard flags helps us prioritize problems and resolve them faster. Please familiarize yourself with the list of standard flags: see https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/flag-postsWhat is Flagging?

I clicked the link, had a quick look through the page, and was annoyed because I didn't  understand why my flag was denied but the post was still closed. At this point, I didn't know what I had done wrong, so I flagged another off-topic question with the same flag type. It was rejected, and given the exact same response as was given to the other one, so I gave the help centre page another look - this time thoroughly - and saw where it had mentioned the part that explained off-topic questions. However, the response to my flags did not help me to arrive at this conclusion, and since both had the exact same text, I wondered if they were automated. Are they, or are they written by moderators? And if they are automated, can they be changed to something more helpful?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are unhelpful flag responses automated?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've posted a feature request to clarify the help center: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/384095/241919.


















(Not very) recently, an AI chatbot https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/ChatGPT was released to the public. It is really sophisticated that it can also answer many kinds of questions, regardless if it is factually correct or wrong.
It has been https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-bannedbanned on Stack Overflow and made https://stackoverflow.com/help/gpt-policyofficial due to the disruption it caused. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/384396/ban-chatgpt-network-wideAnother discussion on the main Meta concluded with https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/385002/241919a staff stating "we hope that folks on network sites feel comfortable establishing per-site policies responsive to their communities' needs."

Recently, there was a user (ab)using ChatGPT by posting its responses as answers as-is without mentioning the source. Currently, these have been deleted as plagiarism (as per our help center, https://anime.stackexchange.com/help/referencingHow to reference material written by others).
Moving forward, how should these kinds of AI-generated posts, including answers and questions, be treated in this community?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we treat ChatGPT (and other AI-generated) posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about using ChatGPT for wikis and excerpt (given proper attribution etc al)? Should we treat those with the same mindset?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've heard about ChatGPT since everybody is talking about it, but I dont know it very well.

ChatGPT's responses are peculiar in that when you see it, you probably know it.


















Deal with them as we do for non-referenced material. We already have the tools, we do not need a more-specific policy. From the point of view of the readers, there's no loss if a bot can generate well sourced, correct answers to questions.

I just noticed the two following question posts:

https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/53977/70615Why is there a curfew for students in Academy City? (2019-08-14)

In A Certain Scientific Railgun, it's mentioned several times that there is a curfew for students in Academy City. Why is this so? Is this ever explained?


https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/56686/70615Curfew in Academy City (2020-01-31)

In A Certain Scientific Railgun, it's mentioned several times that there is a curfew for students in Academy City. Why is this so? Can someone explain to me please.



The newer one has a worse title, the first sentence in the body is the exact same (which leads me to believe it is a copy-paste), and the second sentence is the same question with wrong grammar and punctuation.
But the newer one got an answer post and the original didn't.
If this wasn't such a blatant copy, I'd strongly consider voting the older as a dup of the newer on the basis that it would help future users find the one with the answer. But in this scenario, I don't like the idea of sign-posting to a post that shows poor etiquette: If I assume good faith, then either they just didn't know what to do when they see a question they have that doesn't have an answer yet (follow and upvote), or they failed to research. If I assume bad faith, then that's even worse and it would feel quite wrong to me to "enshrine" a bad-faith post as the more canonical Q&A.
How should I decide which to close as a duplicate of which?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What to do when a newer, blatant dup (likely copy-paste) gets an answer instead of the original?

Would someone consider adding the tag "duplicate-questions" (like [the tag on MSE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/duplicate-questions))?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5given the newer question got answered, i'd update the question title and close the older question as duplicate because there is a redirect that get sets up. ideally we should have caught the newer question before it got answered

I realize physics questions are not a good fit for us, but considering the user posted their own answer, I don't see it as a problem. It was closed for being off topic, but looking through the help center, I don't see an actual reason this is off topic. Physics is actually a bit relevant when it comes to A Certain Magical Index, as it is a story where magic and science collide, so one could argue it falls under "Historical or societal context of an anime or manga".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should this Railgun question have been closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note: I originally intended to ask this question in the same post as [How does Misaka survive heat dissipation in her own body when using her abilities?](//anime.stackexchange.com/q/67668/70615) (which hasn't gotten any close-votes so far, so it seems that at least that is on-topic), but when I asked it like that, IIRC, it got a close-vote for being too broad. I decided to make a separate, self-answered Q&A because I wasn't certain that I was doing the math/logic right (this would let others post competing, better answers), and sure enough, other people brought up points I hadn't considered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And at the time of asking both these questions, I didn't know the information about personal realities that is in your (Shaymin's) answer, so I _incorrectly_ assumed that the question about heat damage to a normal person would be required to answer the one about damage to Misaka herself. I had no devious intent. I just didn't know something and tried to do my best and be a good community contributor based on what I knew.


















I will of course abide by the site's consensus, but I would like to state my dissent as far as closing this question goes.
This question is similar and wasn't closed: https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2235/how-is-misakas-railgun-so-destructive/36758How is Misaka's railgun so destructive?
I personally enjoy seeing these types of questions. They show a high degree of passion for analyzing a work and applying real world principles, and I believe that will draw in more visitors to the site.
As I've stated previously, I think the user showing their willingness to answer their own question makes a difference. And this user has given an extensive self-answer that might be of interest to others.
However, based on how we seem to have agreed overanalyzing is bad (https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4509/is-it-ok-to-overanalyze-an-animeIs it ok to overanalyze an anime?), it seems to me site rules are being upheld by closing this question. So, again, I'm simply stating my dissent.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2622/why-is-this-reality-check-question-closed


















Anime physics came at a point where we didn't know what we were doing and trying to find a niche. The question of why Mikoto's railgun is so destructive is frame more toward looking for an in-universe explanation to attempt to explain things drawing in realize physics as an analogy of sorts. Anime of course is not typically grounded or constrained by real-life laws of physics. Those types of questions had their ups and downs, but we can still have some fun sprinkling a bit of math on our answers.
The mentioned question in my opinion really straddles a fine line between something hypothetical and something unreasonably absurd. Such as aside from Level 6 Shift Mikoto being under the influence of Kihara Gensei. It would be our of character for Mikoto to launch a person as materiel for a railgun (it would be more of something Mugino or Accelerator [maybe Kakine] might do). She sticks to her arcade coins for a reason. Mikoto throughout Railgun and Index reaches different peaks and power spikes. Level 6 Shift Mikoto (mentioned to be 2% of the power of Level 6) and Mikoto's Liquid Proof (i.e., liquid coated) Railgun, supported by Misaki, piloting the Anti-Art Attachment are both extremely powerful, but on different levels and circumstances. Both can be considered "maximum potential". In these forms the power and potential of these forms really exceed the bounds to real-life physics, so how do you expect to calculate the uncalculateable?
As for the physics part of the question, there are a lot of variables to consider and a lot of assumptions to be made, the heat capacity/conductivity of a human for one can vary by climate, environment (indoor v outdoor vs in a vacuum), and what a person is wearing, their water, fat content, method of conducting/heat generation (microwaves vs sonic waves vs conductive current vs accumulated air friction by some means) etc. A person of Mikoto's build is likely to be below that of an average person (she is a middle schooler to high schooler, depending on which time period you look at, after all). Even if we attempted to infer optimal conditions, with in realistic bounds, what question about the series will this question really answer? The question itself is not unlike power comparison of characters in ideal scenarios with ideal power ups, sure we can indulge in power fantasies, but will questions like this be useful for anything but filling head canon? How fast can Mikoto heat up a burrito in average would be more reasonable than how fast can Mikoto burn up a human body at the very peak of her power.
Even if we were to focus on only the physics side and ignore the fantastical anime power level bits, it's more hypothetical thermodynamics than anime and manga related. Without the Railgun power level stuff it might be something better suited for Physics.SE, if they even take these types of questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Reading your extended reasoning here, I'm wondering now if there's a miscommunication between us that didn't get realized in the comment section on the main post. I'm asking about heat dissipation done specifically due to an electrical shock attack- not heat damage due to being used as a human railgun projectile. Have I understood you correctly? Was this a misunderstanding you had due to a lack of clarity in my question post? If so, I can edit to make the question post clear on that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would still say no. The way you present your question is fairly obtuse. The human body is a conductor of electricity. But what relevance is does this have to the series? Replace Mikoto with another high output source and this would be a question about heat conversion via human tissue resistance as the result of electrical shock. If you gloss over these details and give an arbitrary number based on predefined assumptions, if not very different from answering based of perceived head canon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are a variety of types of electrical contact, each with important characteristics (different types of current s such as AC vs DC play a factor). Tissue damage due to electrical exposure is caused primarily by the conversion of electric energy to heat, resulting in thermal injury.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are also a variety of factors that affect resistance such as certain types of tissue having more resistance than others, such as skin and bones, and how the current spreads based on point of contact from most to least resistant. Factor's such as moisture (or lack of) in the skin or from sweat also play a factor. Electric burns typically happen at points of contact and typically spread from there...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question about Mikoto's railgun being destructive is a question pertaining to the inherit output in an in-universe setting, we use real-life physics here to extrapolate a reason and compare it to real-life as a frame of reference. The conclusion to that question is, given the calculations, something missing from the formula since the force she outputs exceed the hasty calculations made. It is not, like asking using real-life physics how much heat would be generated if Mikoto electrocuted an average person of her same build. Even if it was, there would be many depending factors to cover.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"_But what relevance is does this have to the series?_" See my comment on this AMSE post for why I mistakenly thought (with good intentions) that such a Q&A would be necessary to set up a following Q&A.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Clear explanation of karma-kun's answer to the final math problem in Assassination Classroom?](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/36911/clear-explanation-of-karma-kuns-answer-to-the-final-math-problem-in-assassinati)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is an explanation base on something that happens in an anime/manga so it's on topic aside from the mathematics meta tag that shouldn't be there



















As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have https://anime.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestiona tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year.
As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
-- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation

That doesn't eliminate the need for having https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/moderators altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.
So as we say goodbye to 2022 (and where did January go, right?) and dive head first into 2023, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0TPg.gifexciting stats. Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on Anime & Manga over the past 12 months:

Footnotes
¹ "Community" here refers both to https://anime.stackexchange.com/usersthe membership of Anime & Manga without https://anime.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsdiamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/-1user #-1.
² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.
³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-userGenerally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.
⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.
⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.
⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.
⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

The idea there in Chess SE already is there's no need for a tag because there's already the name in the post. I wasn't applying the rule. I was applying the idea.

This does not help to define the question, nor does it help in the search. If (...) name is relevant to the question, it would have been used in the question body anyway; thus, being searchable.

In general, it's discouraged to prevent answers past certain chapters/episodes because the question is not only for the asker but also for future visitors. Otherwise, if the answer is only available past that chapter, then the only possible answer is "it's explained in episode x, but spoiler!" without mentioning the detail, which is pretty much a sub-standard answer on Stack Exchange.
Instead, suggest the answers to use spoiler blocks past certain chapters. This will give everyone the freedom if they want to spoil themselves.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! Is the following OK? ---- I've not watched or read past episode X; please wrap such content in spoilers (using `!>`). "It's explained later / in ep X" also works.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@OverLordGoldDragon the point is, Stack Exchange always encourages having standalone answers, preferably without needing to search and read external sources to understand the answers. "It's explained later in ep X" is almost similar to "[your answer is in another castle](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/241919)" which while not as bad as a non-descriptive link-only answer, it's still a low-quality answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Right, I didn't word that well. I'd prefer, though it's not critical, that the episode number wasn't disclosed either, without the spoiler bubble - is that fine? New wording ------ I've not watched or read past episode X; please wrap such content in spoilers (using `!>`), including the episode number, but otherwise OK to mention "it's explained later".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@OverLordGoldDragon although it's not my personal preference to also hide the chapter/episode number because future visitors have to guess whether they will be spoiled or not, I think that's still a fair suggestion as the asker.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm, makes sense. In that case maybe it works to suggest the episode number, if stated, be with a ~10 episode uncertainty window, as personally I rather not know the exact episode an event is due.
