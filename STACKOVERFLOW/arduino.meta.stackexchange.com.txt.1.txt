This was the the closing announcement from the http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49538/arduinoprevious incarnation of Arduino:


  The future of Arduino on Stack Exchange
  
  After a week and a half in private beta, Arduino Stack Exchange has
  attracted some excellent questions, with great answers written by
  helpful, knowledgeable Arduino experts. Kudos!  What you're
  doing is great... But this isn't the right site for it, not right now.
  The volume
  of questions here is very low; more importantly, this is clearly
  becoming an Arduino-focused electronics site - and we already have an
  excellent site for electronics and
  electrical engineering professionals, students, and enthusiasts
  with a big
  focus on Arduino.  Therefore, we plan to close this
  site on April 25, 2013.  This is our
  screw-up, not yours. When we were debating whether to send this site
  into beta, I
  voiced some concern that there was a lot of overlap in the
  definition. After some debate internally, we decided to go ahead
  with the launch, thinking there would be enough interest in other
  Arduino topics to carry the site. We were wrong. However, I still
  think this site does demonstrate that there is a wealth of
  knowledge that hasn't necessarily found a place within EE. 
  Well... It should. There's no reason why y'all shouldn't
  be asking and answering the same good Arduino-specific questions on
  EE.SE that you've asked and answered here. Over the years, many
  different products and platforms have found homes within larger Stack
  Exchange sites by directing folks to a specific tag and just being
  active enough to guide them toward asking good, on-topic questions.
  Indeed, a fair number of Stack Exchange sites came into being after a
  thriving community developed on an existing site and then later broke
  off...  Some day, Arduino may follow this same path. Until
  then, I welcome you to help incubate the Arduino community on Stack
  Exchange by
  becoming an active member of Electrical Engineering. I've started
  a discussion on bolstering
  the Arduino community on EE.


The community needs to be on point this time around and focus on building a successful community. Moving forward out of private beta will not be a freebie for us.

What can we do differently this time to better our chances at a successful site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What went wrong the last time, and how can we avoid the same mistakes?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We need to all post more questions.  Last time, we kinda "rushed" to get a whole bunch of people to sign up at the last minute (and pulled some funny stuff with the suggested question voting), so participation in Beta wasn't nearly what it could have been. (My $0.02)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mods may want to migrate Arduino related questions from EE (where they were often derided, ridiculed, or discounted).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ron perhaps in the future Arduino questions that are closed as off-topic at EE can be migrated over here, but that's not an option for private beta. The site needs to prove itself on its own firstb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How many times do we have to run a beta arduino site before we get a pass? I agree wholeheartedly that all the previous questions that were migrated to EE should move back.  Take my points away from my EE profile if you want. I just want the SE experience without the intimidation of the EE area's community.  The types of questions asked on EE force the relatively beginner type of questions for the arduino answer-seeker to be overwhelmed or intimidated.  And while I'm glad there's an arduino subreddit, it's pretty lame for aggregating *correct* answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that more weight needs to be placed on the quality of the questions. There are already a number of questions where it isn't quite clear what is being asked. The onus needs to be on the person asking to provide enough detail and a clear enough question to get good answers. There seems to be a tendency on beta SEs to just answer poor questions anyway to gain rep, but in the long term, these questions do not contribute to the knowledge base.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Cybergibbons Agreed. The key aspect however is that we can guide those users into asking better questions, rather than intimidating and alienating them. But that's something we have not being doing so far in our beta. We should put a stronger focus on quality of questions. Probably a good way to do it would be through coaching of the editors that we already have.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@cyber Use examples please. Quality is hard to discuss without specific cases to compare and evaluate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding posting more questions, yes that's important:  repeating my previous comment, when the Arduino Tre board comes out (linux + Arduino uController) there will be a lot more questions being asked, since the Arduino universe will expand in scope.  Perhaps a question of timing, if this beta lasts long enough so we can start seeing questions from the new board.




















I have a Retina display, and the favicon is faceless, plain, and depressing everywhere I go. Can we please fix this?

Easy Repro Steps:


Open Chrome (haven't tested it on anything else)
Zoom in (command-+ on a Mac) to 200%
Go to Arduino.SE
Observe the facelessness of the icon.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Halp! The favicon is faceless!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'Tis fine on my end.  (Vista, FF 26)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It only does this on a Retina display.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose so, no bug for me either.


















I realize this has been discussed in the https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9218/if-this-isnt-a-duplicate-of-ee-might-want-to-consider-elevating-fewer-electronArea 51 proposal and in the old site before it died, but I think that it would be a good idea to set this straight on Meta for the future's sake, so we have a strong 

What separates Arduino.SE from Electronics.SE?

Some topics I believe might make a difference, and I'd like to hear the community's input specifically regarding these (but about Arduino & EE in general):


Arduino has a more varied audience than EE in general.  As should be well known, Arduino is used by people ranging in career from artist to engineer.  Thus, the answers on this site will be written in a different way than on EE, where more inherent knowledge of EE is expected.
The Arduino platform is a product-line (along with some similar, yet not official, products) and not subject of study.  This is a key difference--some questions that would be categorized as "off topic" as a "shopping question" on EE may be perfectly on-topic here.  (Yet, this is just a guess--I want community input)
Arduino users may have programming issues that are very closely tied to hardware issues.  This fills a void left by EE and SO, as EE doesn't like anything too software related, yet SO doesn't want anything too hardware related.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is Arduino.SE different? [EE.SE redux]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The varied audience argument is valid (in the context if this site) only when we *actually have that audience on the site*. At present, the questions don't seem to show that we have artists or designers in the community. Too early to tell, so I may turn out to be wrong.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, what about compatibles? Are only those which go through the IDE going to be of interest? Of course, that doesn't rule out those that aren't pin-compatible. I couldn't seem to wrap my head around that reading the proposal etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also with various shields, arduPi etc. it's not only about arduino anymore. And to be honest I'm sick of this what is the difference bla bla. If you say no difference they close all questions as off-topic, if you say there is a diffrence then they say no we have already XXXX.SE maybe they should once make up their minds.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is Intel Galileo on topic?


















How do I describe or draw my circuit in such a way that everybody understands what I am building? On EE.SE there is this circuit editor available to quickly draw a circuit, I'd propose to have that here too.

There are not many questions on the Arduino stack yet, but I invite everybody to add example questions that would benefit from a circuit editor in the answers below.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I describe or draw my circuit in such a way that everybody understands what I am building?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It should be allowed to use Circuit-Lab here too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RobertCartaino I deliberately asked for example questions in the comments, so they can be added to the question text. The example questions are hardly worth an answer. You seem to disagree, what is your vision on this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Comments are used to ask for clarification or suggest improvements to a post.  Comments simply were not designed to be used the way you suggest. But posting *'answers'* lets folks vote to gauge their usefulness. Answers allow wiki-style editing to add to and improve those answers where needed. Answers also have their *own* comments if users have questions or suggestions. Comments provide none of those capabilities. Comments are ephemeral by design; they may even become hidden if too many comments are added to the post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another typical example of where circuit diagrams are required. http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/876/project-showcase-14b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://i.imgur.com/glcclTu.jpg


















I know math is not everybody's favorite, but sometimes you just don't get away without when designing a circuit for Arduino. MathJax is enabled on EE.SE; can we have that here too? 

There are not many questions on the Arduino stack yet, but I invite everybody to add example questions that benefit from a MathJax below.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there an easy way to enter formulas in questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, the way to request support for MathJax (LaTeX support) is to demonstrate a *need* for this in actual practice. As you suggested, the best way to make this happen is by compiling a collection of posts below which would *substantively* be improved with the addition to MathJax. If the benefit to *this* site can be demonstrated in actual use, we will bring it up for consideration. Good luck!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RobertCartaino How to prevent "Trivial answer converted to comment"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry about that. It's an automated system. Add a bit of supporting text do describe *why* you think the post you linked would benefit from MathJax.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the time being I use http://www.math.ucla.edu/~robjohn/math/mathjax.html You can place a button on your bookmark toolbar to enable MathJax on any page.


















I disagree removing the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduinoarduino before the name of the board.
Exist a http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Productslot of Arduinos that could make some troubles in tags, if we put just the name of the Arduino like:

Arduino Ethernet
Arduino Mini
Arduini Micro
Arduino Robot
Arduino Nano
Arduino Pro

Exist many possibilities to have a tag https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ethernetethernet or https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/robotrobot that don't have anything to do with the Arduino Ethernet or with the Arduino Robot.
Even the Tags https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/minimini, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/micromicro and https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nanonano would be confusing just with this.
I think that putting the word arduino before the name of the board will be more organized.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmmm.  This is a very good point that I hadn't thought of...  +1b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since this was the highest-voted answer, I've implemented tag synonyms on this basis. Everything is now of the format like: [tag:arduino-uno] and [tag:arduino-mini] etc.


















There are a lot of different Arduino clones of varying quality on the market. Obviously they are mostly equivalent to the standard ones, so hopefully the majority of questions should be widely applicable.

However, there may be cases where a clone's features, layout, and/or spec deviate from the norm, whether by mistake or by design.

Should this site include questions which relate to specific clones, or would that be off-topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are clone-specific questions on topic for this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think they should be on-topic here... there isn't really a better site for them on the SE network.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What happens if they *don't* use the Arduino IDE / Wiring language -- think [ElectricImp](https://ide.electricimp.com)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't think Electric Imp is an "arduino clone"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sachleen No, indeed, it's not. I am curious about how these not-Arduino, but similar area boards will be handled. Like, [Pinoccio](http://pinocc.io) is shipping an [arduino library](https://github.com/Pinoccio/pinoccio-arduino-library), but also a whole [web based software stack](https://t.co/MSB89cnla9).


















http://fritzing.org/home/Fritzing appears to be the official standard for Arduino circuits. (Site currently mostly down at the moment.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Beware that the Fritzing wiring diagrams are not really useful for sharing the circuit diagram, they are useful for reproduction of the circuit. You need datasheets for all components handy to interpret how it is connected and the result will be hard to follow. I saw Fritzing also allows for circuit diagrams, but I don't know how well that integrates with the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would think cross compatibility between EE.SE's C-L would be beneficial.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jippie - You know that EE.SE has a (kind of) standard of asking posters to include proper schematics (with component descriptors and all). That's great and I think we should have the same here, but I honestly thought that Fritzing diagrams could be ok, too, just so we make the transition easier for the less experienced. Arduino sites use it for a reason. What do you all think?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo it is not just the asking posters that may want to include a quick diagram. Anyways, I'm not trying to say one is better than the other, my point is that it would really help to have an easy way to include circuit diagrams in questions and answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One thing to add: Fritzing screenshot could be useful. No need to do a full schematic for a simple LED demonstration (say "Do I really need a resistor?") to add color, but then for more advanced projects request that the OP draws a schematic using Circuit-Lab or using the "schematic" tab on Fritzing and taking a screenshot there. Screenshots are the only option until the dev team implements anything: that is if they do ever.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jippie hmmmmm. Your question had a hole, you should've said "*how do I draw a circuit so eerybody understands **on this site***", that might've indicate this answerer that you are asking a different question.


















This may just be an error on your end. I would try to restart your computer and see if this fixes the problem. It may also be a zoom error. Try zooming in or out and see if it fixes the problem.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nope, just reproed on a different machine. Try the steps above.


















No, this isn't really what was meant by a http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/shopping question. The author of this question is wondering if there is a way to do {x}, where {x} just happens to be something they will likely have to go out and purchase. That is very different than asking a photographer (for example) which camera they should buy.

Sometimes when we offer this type of general guidance, it is in response to a specific behavior we are trying to avoid. But oftentimes when these lessons get passed on, the underlying application gets lost and all we remember is the trigger word which says (in this case) "shopping = bad". 

In the context of this community, a shopping question might be something like "What is the best sound add-on pack?" There are a lot of them out there, so unless the author has narrowed down their problem statement so there is only one (or very few) possible answers, the community is only guessing what will help that user specifically. That's what we're trying to avoid here.

It's a tough balancing act; trying to decide if a question is good for the site, versus learning from the past about what doesn't work for a community. Sometimes you simply have to see if this becomes a problem in actual practice, rather than anticipating problems that may never materialize. All I can suggest is, for now, to judge the individual question on its merits. Is it a useful questions for your community? And then circle around down the road if it turns out that this type of content does not work for your site. 

Good question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, thanks. I can remember a lot on controversy about a similar question on another site.


















There are many Arduino compatible micros and derivatives. I'm thinking specifically here of the https://www.spark.io/Spark Core.

It's not a clone, but uses the Arduino Sketch language and is wi-fi IoT oriented.

Are question related to Arduino compatible devices applicable here?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it OK to ask questions about "Arduino compatible" micros (not clones)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5possible duplicate of [Are clone-specific questions on topic for this site?](http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/15/are-clone-specific-questions-on-topic-for-this-site)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sachleen I tried to make it clear in the question that this is **not** about Clones. But perhaps that was misunderstood. Arduino compatible or derivative devices are NOT clones and generally provide another level of functionality that Arduino official boards don't have.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK I'm already confused, is there an official distinction between compatible vs. clone anywhere, or should I ask that as a question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisO Here's clarification from Massimo Banzi in Arduino blog: http://blog.arduino.cc/2013/07/10/send-in-the-clones/#.Uw29BhDYPxwb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@akellyirl Thanks that answers my question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Arduino Compatible == Clone. I don't really know where you're going with this....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson (Arduino Compatibles, Derivatives) != Clones... Derivatives extend the functionality of Arduino in a meaningful way. Quoting from Massimo Banzi's Blog (ref: above) "Derivatives. These are products that are derived from the Arduino hardware design but they innovate either by providing a different layout and features often to better serve a specific market. These are the products that have also helped Arduino become so ubiquitous." Yes, Compatibles are more "Hazy" territory but usually they also extend Arduino functionality in some way.


















Found the bug... when you zoom to 200% the code detects this and change the fav icons sprites file from http://cdn.sstatic.net/img/favicons-sprite16.png?v=2a2968ded8b1ccc425e160db793c03e1this (16x16 icons) to http://cdn.sstatic.net/img/favicons-sprite32.png?v=6edcecf7b8efae77d1bf2212ca614a95that (32x32). (Very smart, team! :))

Now the only problem is, that while in the 16x16 sprite there is icon for 
Arduino, in the 32x32 it's just blank as you see yourself.

With proper icon:


  


And without:

My personal opinion is that the site should include within its scope all questions about:


The official boards
Questions about the official IDE
The range of shields available
Clones compatible with the IDE or the shields
Devices/chips that are mentioned as being accessories for Arduino


So, yes. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The thing about compatible devices is that whilst they are compatible in some way such as using the Sketch commands and providing Analogue and Digital I/Os, they don't necessarily meet the criteria you laid out. Nevertheless Arduino Sketches can port to these devices and they can provide additional benefits to an Arduino user and therefore may complement an Arduino user's toolkit of devices. Possible question for "compatibles" may be: library porting; equivalent capability etc...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would include more IDEs to be in-topic, such as the Eclipse and Visual Studion Arduino plugins, WinAVR etc. What do you think?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo I would consider such questions to be borderline. For example, my question on using [RStudio with Arduino](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/38/how-do-i-communicate-with-the-uno-using-r-through-rstudio) is considered off-topic. I think this deserves its own discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about Bareduinos (ATMEGA chip on a breadboard), only with the IDE or programing it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson Are you the user who participated last time as well? Nice to see you here :) Bareduino questions would depend on the specific instance. Its hard to say without an example to gauge the type of questions to be expected. Although, if the question seems too EE specific, then EE.SE would be a better home.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR Yeah I didn't know that they did a second beta however I didn't sign up so I think I accidentally used a bug to sign up! Haha :) I hope this one doesn't go to waste either. I'm hoping for Moderator, or at least temporary but I think I'm too late. Oh well! It *does* take a ton of time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson If you signed through the site link on the A51 page, then thats not a bug :) This beta seems to be quite different from last time. The questions are far more diverse. Anyways, I hope the same as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR But the question count is too low it seems like. 10ish per day... yikes. Working on that now. It is only private now but still... that's what really killed us last time


















I agree with Butzke that there can be confusion about whether or not the tag means the board. There are even three https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ethernetethernet questions already. However, it is unlikely that https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unouno will be mistaken for anything other than the Uno board. I propose that some boards, such as the Uno, Yún, Duemilanove, and Esplora should have not have arduino in the tag name (https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-duemilanovearduino-duemilanove can't even exist; it's five chars over the limit), but others, such as Ethernet, Micro, and Robot should.

The initial days of beta can be a little awkward for tags. This post is meant to be a community-wiki style list of tags that need to be cleaned up for cases where users (like me) don't have sufficient reputation to make the changes.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which tags need to be cleaned up?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I went through a lot of these and cherry picked the obvious ones. We don't really create tags and synonyms until an actual use case or problem is demonstrated. For the rest, how to retag individual questions would need a bit more experience from an actual Arduino user, so I'll leave those until pro tem moderators are appointed.

Programming is obviously a major part of using an Arduino, and a considerable amount of it is very domain specific (e.g. using particular libraries, or working with particular hardware).

However, I suspect we're likely to see general programming questions coming up as well here (especially from inexperienced hobbyists). For example, we may see questions about general C/C++ syntax, scope, data types, etc..

I think there should be some flexibility to avoid alienating site users. However, we'll presumably need to establish a guideline which indicates what kind of programming questions should be considered off-topic, and potentially better suited to Stack Overflow.

What should that guideline be?

Irrelevant Tags

These tags are mostly accidentally created and should be removed.

Vague Tags

These should be removed (maybe even blocked if there is an option in the SE engine) because they are too vague.


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/inputinput Too vague. The question that uses it uses it fine, but it really doesn't help someone find that question, and interrupts should be sufficient.
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ideide should be split into https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-idearduino-ide and individual tags such as https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/eclipseeclipse

Simple — A "generic programming problem" that does not need an understanding of Arduino hardware or its programming  interface to solve belongs on Stack Overflow.

For example, trying to figure out why a programming loop is not terminating would be an issue for Stack Overflow. It doesn't matter if the program just happens to be for an Arduino application; trying to resolve generic issues ("how to program") are outside the scope of this community.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would add to your post that if it's specific about the Arduino libraries (standard or imported) that it should probably be here. You don't need to know much about the Arduino hardware to answer, but it probably would get much better answers than the four views on SO that it would get with that many questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After some thought, I respectfuly disagree. Although there is a healthy tendency to avoid overlap between stacks, this is one that our communit would benefit of. It's similar to the overlap between Ar.SE and EE.SE in which an Arduino question with some electronics design can be asked in either stack. For more details, please see my new answer down below: http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/a/161/46b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi, I don't think such a rule is viable, because people [will not know](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2604/13327) whether their problem is Arduino-related or not. What we realistically can outlaw is questions about code which doesn't run on an Arduino.


















What I like most about our new Arduino SE network is that we are now free to ask whatever questions about Arduino we want.

I often felt very restrained about asking an Arduino question in EE.SE, fearing that it would be downvoted and closed. I don't feel like that anymore.

So, while I agree with Robert that programming questions may be posted on SO, we should avoid consider Arduino programming questions off-topic here. The OP should be free to choose where to post an Arduino programming question. 

Given its high traffic and size, SO may now be the place to post a pure Arduino programming question, if you want an answer quickly. But, in time, I hope we can build enough momentum so that our site is the preferred one for all Arduino questions.

On the other hand, if the question has nothing to do with Arduino (ie. for loops, syntax), then I agree with the OP that we should move it to SO.

Update: After some thought, and a question that's been asked today, I changed my mind and wanted you all to think about it for a bit. Although there is a healthy tendency to avoid overlap between stacks, this is one that our communit would benefit of. It's similar to the overlap between Ar.SE and EE.SE in which an Arduino question with some electronics design can be asked in either stac. For more details, please see https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/161/46my new answer down below.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with "never," but I agree with the sentiment.  For example: A question saying "I know how to declare an integer with the Arduino, but how do I work with decimal numbers?" or "What's a while loop?" etc. should be off topic here.  However, a question about the Serial library for the Arduino should be on topic, IMO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@anorton Agreed. It was indeed too strong. I've replaced "never" by "avoid".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you, @Ricardo but I think that question that regards aruino specific programming. Such as arduino pre-assembler, library coding principles and such is in the domain of Arduino SE (even when the question is in part about syntax)


















We should leave them alone until we get about half way through beta. Due to the site being in Private Beta, I don't think that we should move them yet, because it would make those questions un-accessible until the site goes into Beta (which at the minimum will be 1 week). Once we get going good, I think that we should determine what should be carried over to Arduino SE, and what would be considered duplicate based on what has already been asked on SO SE.

I do agree that we will need to do this, but now is not the time. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you might have misunderstood my question. I'm not suggesting we move anything from SO to Arduino SE. I was asking about the scope of Arduino SE, and how we determine what kind of programming questions are suitable to be asked here (as opposed to what would be more suitable on SO).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ahh, gotcha thx for the clarification


















Just adding to Robert's answer, one simple check would be to read a question excluding any mentions of Arduino and then seeing if it makes sense. If the question does make sense without any mentions of the Arduino platform, then it is a generic programming question. Otherwise, if the Arduino mention is critical to answering the question, then it is on-topic here.

Ex. Why is this loop not terminating on the Uno? would be off-topic as it is unlikely that Arduino's architecture would be causing an infinite loop.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I posted an alternative answer to this question and I wanted you to take a look and comment. Basically I'm saying, why take the trouble of removing Arduino mentions to see if the question still makes sense? Why reflect so much to check if a Arduino programmming question is pure programming or not? Why not just answer it? We are certainly very capable of answering any Arduino questions, aren't we? Well, it's just food for thought.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo We are capable of answering a wide variety of questions ranging from software design, algorithms, data structures, electrical concepts, electronics designs and usage, etc.. Just the fact that we can answer them and that they happen to be in the neighbourhood of our actual purpose, doesnt mean we should. The wider scope we have, the more diluted the focus of the site becomes. How? A person who may come here specifically interested in Arduino, will not feel as comfortable on seeing questions on transistors and MOSFETs ...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... being interfaced to control an external device or somebody interested in a lighting a few LEDs will be lost on seeing a question on software engineering models being discussed. Why is this bad? The limited resources that we as a community have to solve such issues gets spread thin over multiple divergent fields of study, some of which may be so far off what we actually started with, that the site becomes a confused mix of multiple things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo Think of this as it *scales up*, rather than at the present size and activity levels. While I realize my tone may be ominous, the fact is there are sites at present dealing with exactly this issue and I have been involved in the clean-up going on. Its a pain to sort out such messes later on (100-200+ off-topic posts), plus the gains that there may appear to be at present do not last beyond a certain point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Point taken. We can certainly keep the existing guidelines for pure programming questions. I just wanted to express my opinion after seeing that specific question closed.


















My view on the four issues presented:


Installing IDEs should be off-topic unless the install process is substantially different when using the Arduino plugin.  (Example of exception: if you had to download Eclipse from an entirely different source, install it in some special way, etc., that would be fine here.)
If the question is about using the IDE itself, that should be off topic.  (e.g. "How do I create a project in Eclipse?"--no.  "How do I turn on/off Intellisense?"--no.)  If the question relates in a substantial way to using the Arduino extension to the IDE, that should be on-topic. (e.g. "How do I use the "--yes.)
No.  Specific features like code highlighting would be best asked on Stack Overflow, unless there is something very special about Arduino libraries that makes them hard to highlight, etc. 
I would contend this should be "yes."  Uploading is something that wouldn't typically be built-in to the IDE (and would be introduced with the Arduino plugin), or it would be something platform dependent (e.g. uploading to an AVR chip is different than an Intel chip, etc.)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed on all the above. IDEs are massively complicated, so we can't hope to answer all questions about them. Limiting our scope to stuff that's fairly unique for Arduino makes a lot of sense.


















Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with having some questions be on topic for more than one site.  We can't assume people who program Arduinos have the programming experience necessary to determine beforehand if their bug that they are confused enough to ask about online is directly related to the Arduino architecture or not.  Some people asking may never have done any programming that wasn't on an Arduino.  I don't think we should set any criteria where only the experts can tell what site a question should go to.  If there's an Arduino involved, it should be allowed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm inclined to agree to a certain extent. Newcomers in particular should be given some leeway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 Sorry, I had not read your answer before, but it is basically the same I said in my new answer today, so we agree. Good! [In my answer](http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/a/161/46), however, I had the chance of discussing an specific case that came out today. Take a look if you have the chance as it illustrates your point as well.


















As our site thrives, there will be a lot of Arduino questions that are now barely accepted on EE.SE that will be migrated here. All of them will, I'm sure. A few stray Arduino programming questions from SO should be migrated as well. That will be great because that's where their home is. 

To prepare for that, we need to make sure that our scope is not as strict as of those other sites. In particular, I think we should make our scope as broad as possible: everything related to Arduinos should be allowed in here. That includes: 


Boards: official, compatible, almost compatible, attempted to be compatible, one-off boards that I designed and etched at home, incomplete or failed attempts of boards, whatever Arduino-like boards.
IDE: official, semi-official, underground, whatever.
Shopping recommendations: as the OP said well, Arduino is a line of products. Some open-source hardware, some not so much. All these should be welcome here.
What else?


Someone coming from EE.SE may think this is too radical. But we can make this site the way we want.

I don't see why we shouldn't allow questions about some obscure board or IDE in here, or shopping questions. That's what Arduinos are all about: diversity, trial and error. 

I usually see arbitrary restrictions in scope as reasons for closing questions that some users don't know or don't like to answer. That goes against the freedom I think we should have here.

That doesn't mean we won't worry about the quality of questions and answers. We should be strict without being mean. We should educate, but not be harsh. But that's topic for another question.

In any case, we should also try and educate instead of censoring. If someone asks a poor quality question, editors should educate these users on how to ask better questions. The editors should try and improve the questions instead of quickly closing them. So, we should avoid closing questions as much as possible. We should try and improve the questions. And having the broadest possible scope will be really important to achieve those goals.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please do be careful about migrating questions from the other sites - the threshold should really be not that a question *can* fit here, but rather that it *does not* fit there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is now becoming a very serious problem.  The incumbant curmudgeons of EESE use the existence of this site as a handy excuse to dump any question which even tangentially mentions "Arduino" - not because it is a better fit here, but simply because *they inherently hate questions from beginners*.  The result is that questions **which belong there** end up here, and as a result end up with weak, ill-informed answers with factual errors which often go unchallenged.


















As I said in https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5/why-is-arduino-se-different-ee-se-reduxanother answer, we should keep our scope broad and our minds open. But that doesn't mean we won't worry about quality. In summary, I think we should do appreciate questions that:


establishes a context (ie. why are you doing what you're doing)
has enough upfront research (the OP tried to solve the problem before coming to us)
shows us how the boards are connected (using schematics or those Arduino drawings linking pins with colored lines). We suggest that we aim at the same high standards as our Big Brother EE.SE site, as explained in those links:


https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/1024/good-tools-for-drawing-schematicsGood tools for drawing schematics
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/28251/rules-and-guidelines-for-drawing-good-schematicsRules and guidelines for drawing good schematics

what else?


We should also try and educate instead of censoring. If someone asks a poor quality question, editors should educate these users on how to ask better questions. The editors should try and improve the questions instead of quickly close them. So, we should avoid closing questions as much as possible. We should only close questions that are hopeless.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good suggestions. To help people out, I think it would probably be useful to have some kind of documentation on how to create and upload schematics or other drawings.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterR.Bloomfield - That we already have - from our big brother EE site. See my updated anwser above.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For "what else," link to, in order of preference: 1) product pages that have links to schematics and data sheets, 2) directly to data sheets and schematics, and 3) product pages without such links.
     I've written ten or so answers in the last couple of days, and more often than not I've had to track down product information myself and, all to frequently, hope that what I'd found was actually for the right product.


















I was adding some code to a question, and noticed that I couldn't get syntax highlighting to work. I added a language hint as is used on Stack Overflow, but it had no effect.

I appreciate that most SE sites won't need syntax highlighting (which is presumably why it's not enabled by default), but obviously it could be very useful for us. Is that something which will be sorted out if/when we graduate to 'proper' SE status, or can we realistically do something about it just now?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do we get syntax highlighting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://meta.electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/340/syntax-highlighting-should-be-supported-on-electrical-engineering-like-on-sob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would also be nice to have formula as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Cybergibbons See http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13/is-there-an-easy-way-to-enter-formulas-in-questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see that sytnax highlighting appears to have been updated and lost the hint of "" . I looked back and confirmed that it did used to work in cases where the snibit of code was not auto detected, nor by the tag. It might be advantageous to have it as default.


















As you guys know, the Moderators are usually chosen at the end of the Private beta period. Seeing that we have minimum 5 days left, I think it is the perfect time to outline what we would like to see in a moderator. A moderator needs to be someone who not only knows arduino inside and out, but also can suggest creative criticism, and who is always can have a positive attitude. 

But that isn't everything that would make the perfect moderator. I am wondering what qualities make the perfect moderator, be sure to include how important these attributes are!

For example:
Knows Arduino inside and out - Necessary 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who will be the Moderator? What attributes should they have?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Temporary* moderators are appointed at the end of the Private Beta.  These aren't permanent.  Anyway--I feel it's a little early for this question... it will be fairly obvious who is (and isn't) taking an active interest in the community (asking/answering questions), as well as its governance (meta participation).  Furthermore, moderators are, in general, supposed to be "invisible"--the community is supposed to decide what is on/off topic, the mods are there simply to make sure no one is being rude/inappropriate/getting out of hand.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@anorton I would argue that the *diamond* should be invisible, not necessarily the user who holds it. Also, in the initial stages, moderators have to be heavily involved as there are not enough users at the needed reputation levels to carry out all the moderation activities needed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR eh... maybe "invisible" didn't convey the term I meant.  My point is that Moderators shouldn't take on a "one man army" approach to keeping the site in check--they need to ensure that they are acting as representatives of the community, rather than a ruling class.  But, that's material for a different thread, methinks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for all the feedback


















Actually, knowing Arduino too well is far from  necessary. They should be knowledgeable, yes, but anything more is just a bonus for the community and their efforts should be focussed as such ;-)

What is needed in a community moderator is the ability to communicate clearly and effectively, as well as have the patience to handle all types of members of the community respectfully. Also, to function impartially even when faced with difficult situations such as that may happen involving respected members, arguments, flame wars, etc. 

Community moderators aren't referred to as janitors for nothing. There is a fair bit of work to be done behind the scenes, a lot of which may be fairly involved and taxing. The only reward for this effort is seeing the site grow and move towards graduation (which can be rather satisfying :) )

The only thing necessary is that the individual should be active and involved in the community through content generation, meta participation, chat availability, editing, reviewing and voting (close/reopen). Also, in general the individual should be helpful and guide new members of the community wherever needed.

Evangelising the community and being a good representative of Arduino.SE wherever the situation may so demand would be great too!  



TL;DR Moderators should know Arduino.SE and we should know them; nothing else is needed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 you do look like a good candidate to me.


















Based on the answers given (Thanks @Butzke!), I felt it prudent to create a tag list of sorts for all the official boards. Feel free to add any missing board with the desirable tag name. If you disagree with any of the tag names, please mention so in a comment.

YES!

We really do need Circuit-Lab on here. The Arduino is more than just code. It is hardware, software, IDE and core libraries. This SE needs efficient/effective methods to communicate all of these functions of the Arduino eco's or framework.

Note SO's arduino tab has many questions with long winded descriptions of circuits, that work in conjunction with code. Where it would be best described with a schematic from Circuit-Lab. A picture is really worth a thousand words.

Often with these cases. The comments explode and drag out with simple questions about what was omitted in the written description. Causing the question to be answered in the comments and not with a clear answer, if at all. In these cases a schematic would provide better questions and result in better answers.

As the answers should also allow Circuit-Lab too.

Are questions about installing IDEs being used to program the board on-topic?

No. But if an IDE has Arduino support maybe questions on how to set it up for arduino could be on topic.
Are questions about using IDEs that are being used to program the board on-topic?

Maybe. Again, if it's specific to doing something with Arduino it could be on topic.
Are questions about specific features of IDEs that are being used to program the board on-topic? Ex. code highlighting, code indentation, etc.

No. This deals with IDE features and has nothing to do with Arduino. The exception would be the official software provided by Arduino.
Are questions about uploading code through various IDEs on-topic?

Yes. It has to do with Arduino specifically.


Ask "What does this have to do with Arduino?" and if the answer to that question is not significant enough, then the question is probably off topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 because I 75% agree with you. Your third dot point `This deals with IDE features and has nothing to do with Arduino`, well, maybe it does. Ex, code highlighting and having Arduino code suitably highlighted would be on-topic IMHO


















Our beta is still in its infacy, but I already see a very diferent set of questions and audience here, when compared to EE.SE.

I think that the vast majority of questions in our beta wouldn't be accepted in EE.SE as they are. They would have to be carefully reworded to make them fit into their scope, and even then, they would be quickly closed as off-topic, as it usually happens.

The main reason for classifying our questions as off-topic there is that most Arduino questions aren't about electronics design. Instead, being about a line of products, some Arduino questions tend to be classified as shopping questions or use of electronics devices.  

Also, the minimum requirements for asking a question on EE.SE are really high. They expect that you know something about EE (ie. draw schematics) before they welcome you there. That counters the nature of Arduino users, who tend to be newbies, very inexperienced hackers (I include myself in that category). Other related reason may be differences in jargon (ie, saying sketch instead of firmware, shields instead of pluggable boards), and so on.

For those reasons, despite of having the tag with most users (arduino), EE.SE still alienates the majority of Arduino users out there. Many come in and ask one question and is quickly shown the exit door. There may be a ton of 1 rep users just like that. For that, and other reasons, EE.SE may be classified as a very marginal Arduino resource, at best. There are far better places on the Net to ask questions about Arduinos than in StackExchange, places where Arduino users are far better appreciated.

The Arduino community is large, but StackExchange still fails to tap into that resource. Having an Arduino site here at SE is, in my opinion, the proper way to get the attention of the 200k+ Arduino begginer hackers out there. 

So, to answer your question, one thing we can do to make sure this instance of the Arduino.SE thrives is to keep our scope broad and accept everything about Arduinos, so that any Arduino user feel at home here. 

Along the way, I think that we, as a community, can help at least some of those noobs graduate and become better Electrical Engineers and help them move on to ask and answer great questions at EE.SE as well. We can show them how to draw good schematics, design and etch their own boards, and so on. But in a much nicer and forgiving way.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I strongly agree. I think you've captured the essence of what Arduino.SE needs to be. Visitors here will often be people just tinkering for fun, so they'll be inexperienced and probably lacking confidence. Sites like EE and SO are much more geared towards professionals or very enthusiastic amateurs. In contrast, we perhaps need to be more down-to-earth, flexible, and encouraging if we want to make this site/community thrive in the long run.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This doesnt really answer the question *what should we do differently given that the previous beta didn't work out*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR - That's a technicallity. What the OP probably wants to hear is what we can do to make our site a success this time around. Whether it's something we did wrong the other time and will do it differently now, or something we did right and will repeat now, it's irrelevant. I didn't participate on the other attempt, so how can I know what's been done?


















I agree with AsheeshR... microprocessor tags should not be the "default" here.  Microprocessor tags fit in better with a community like EE.SE, where a more detailed knowledge of electronics is expected.  

Arduino users will be more apt to type in https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-unoarduino-uno (or similar) instead of tagging with https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/atmega328atmega328. Synonym-izing the tags isn't good, either, as it is possible for a non-https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-unoarduino-uno board to use an https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/atmega328atmega328.  This would lead to substantially awkward tagging.

I recently posted https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/273/when-should-i-use-a-transistor-mosfet-and-when-should-i-use-a-relay?noredirect=1#comment394_273When should I use a transistor, mosfet, and when should I use a relay? to see how the community would react. (Only 3 views so far so not really a big reaction yet, as you can see.) Here's the controversy:



Why it should stay here (obviously my own opinions here, add yours in the comments):


That person would get outrageous downvotes from EE members because it is a simple question
This site is for beginners and trying to get them to use Stack Exchange
EE might refuse to answer it
It still is applicable (if they do ask how to control it)


Why it should be migrated:


It doesn't have to do much with Arduino besides if someone asks "How do I control it with Arduino"
There would be overlap with EE.SE




The number of reasons for keeping it outnumbers the migrating, but those two reasons are very big. I doubt that the Stack Exchange team wants us creating duplicate sites with much overlap: it may be a matter of time until advanced questions start coming up here.

I do know that this is similar to other questions on meta but no real policy of on-the-fence questions has been established. What do you think we should do? How can we prevent this from happening on a daily basis if they aren't fit for Arduino.SE?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our "policy" be for questions that wouldn't survive on EE but aren't exactly fit for this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion there are quite a few beginners questions on EE.SE. What is usually frowned upon is when a question obviously has not been researched and misses trivial knowledge before being asked.


















I am one of the (as of now) 3 people who have voted to close the question as belonging on EE.SE.

This site is not "EEBeginners.SE," and we should not try to become that.  Especially in private beta, we need to stay away from making this site a perfect subset of EE.

The question, as written, doesn't relate to Arduinos in the least.  Even just tagging on "How would I control one with an Arduino?" doesn't really make it obviously on-topic--it doesn't focus primarily on Arduino usage, and relates more to choosing between electrical components.

Something I had to come to terms with last Arduino beta period was that not all questions deserve to have a home on Stack Exchange.  Certain "beginning EE" questions might never be accepted on SE because of the culture of EE.SE.  Just because the question isn't accepted there doesn't mean it is on topic here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You do bring up a few good points: there may never be a home on SE for some of these questions, and we don't want to be Beginners EE.SE either. BTW I cast the final close vote. Although it is my own question, I just tried it to see if it would provide good answers that wouldn't come up on EE. It, however, would've been good on EE too. I'm going to try to see if I can get the post locked for reference, or if it should be deleted.


















We are looking at this wrong.
This question https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/273/when-should-i-use-a-transistor-mosfet-and-when-should-i-use-a-relay?noredirect=1#comment394_273When should I use a transistor, mosfet, and when should I use a relay? clearly shows knowledge on the part of the OP of basic EE and is not entirely relevant to Arduinos in the way it is phrased. It should either be re-written, migrated, or closed.
How a beginner to Arduino-verse would ask the same question is:

I am trying to control A  with Arduino B. The power requirements for A are this but B provides something else. How do I control B using A without burning out A?

Or

The control current for A seems far higher than the safe value of B. What method can I use to throttle the current and/or control the current input to B through A?

In either of these cases, the question highlights that the OP has a problem, has maybe tried to solve it, and most likely lacks the specific knowledge or terminology to reach the solution to the problem themselves without a nudge in the right direction.
These questions, and this audience, is one of the reasons that this site is up and I feel we should keep such questions within our scope. The usual restrictions of basic research, clear problem and progress made should be applied and questions found lacking should be closed. The level of difficulty should not solely be a parameter on the basis of which questions should be closed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is very right.  The "example question," as written, should be migrated (and is why I wrote what I did in my answer).  But I agree that the examples you've listed above should be on-topic.


















I can picture questions like this popping up everywhere:


How do I hack a treadmill?
How do I hack my alarm clock?
How do I hack my garage door opener?


Some of those things aren't really meant to be hacked. We already have one question like this: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/269Using the Waspmote Sensor Board. It isn't that bad alone, but questions like this could add up and really clutter our site.

The treadmill is already on EE (answered my me). Some devices that use AC shouldn't really be messed with, especially from users who don't even know that it is dangerous, or how to do it in the first place. However, I do believe that some of these "hacking questions" may be useful. For example, should we allow, "How do I simulate pressing a physical push button on a PCB?" What should we do about this?

Edit: After a while, questions like this seem to have died down. This doesn't seem like a problem now.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we ban "how to hack XYZ" from our site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's hard to answer a question that targets a specific device. Hacking could also mean illegal modifications in some cases, and those should definitely be banned.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TheDoctor Definitely not allowed for illegal.


















Part of the [7 Essential Meta Questions of Every Beta(http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/)]

We have our site here, and we should start thinking about the theme. We don't have to create a full theme, but if we can get some outstanding ideas, it will only make our site better. What are some ideas that you can think of? We should try to get some ideas.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should the design of our site be?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a great question... however, sites don't get their design until they get out of beta (i.e. they are a graduated site). So don't delete the question, but keep in mind it may keep years for this design to happen.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hichris123 I know it takes a while for the design, but it *was* in the 7 essential questions of every beta. If they put it in there, it must be somewhat important.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The 7 essential questions are kinda out of date... if you're bored there's some [mSO questions on this](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/201776/could-we-update-the-7-essential-meta-questions-blog-post-or-not-link-it-promi).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hichris123 Ouch... 4 years old, not updated, nor taken down? Whoops! Oh well it can spark some activity because lately the site has been slowing down...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This question appears to be off-topic because it is about an event years into the future. Also, as the 7 essential questions are no longer relevant at such an early stage.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A relevant post (on this meta) by one of our designers from earlier this week: [Custom Arduino Community design and logo - Information gathering](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2716/80022) :)


















Just a few ideas I had:


Arduino color (HEX: 00979c, accent color: e34c00) We may have to get it cleared by Arduino itself, but SE is pretty well respected so I don't think that it will be that hard as long as we try to add a few key differences. The colors, however, are comforting for a user to see.
An Uno with a LED (blinking, maybe?). This is a symbolic "start" of Arduino knowledge, and might be a good symbol too new users. Animations might be annoying, maybe just two quick flashes at a page load? It might still be distracting but at least have the LED drawn on.


We should also think of names for the site... oh well, tomorrow!

I make a small little image here in GIMP:


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Take a look at [gaming.se] site theme. Its got some elements of what you suggest.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we were to have an LED blink on page load, it most definitely should be the on-board pin 13 LED.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Guy Good point. However, I'm not going to mess with the design: it is still a bit off. We only got into public today.


















I do believe that they should be allowed.

Arduino is a line of products and their accessories. (Also with their code.) SO is different here. Some users are even pushing allowing shopping questions. This is very similar to a shopping recommendation.

I say that we leave it for now. If it becomes a problem that it becomes only finding libraries, then the moderators implemented by then will have to clean up the problem before it grows. It may seem like a nuisance, but I do believe that if we can attract another user this way, it can only help us. Plus, there are only a limited number of libraries available out their. I've noticed a pattern with Arduino that people tend to create similar projects.


  My gut feeling (coming from Stack Overflow) is that such questions are off-topic. 


Remember, this isn't SO. We were given a canvas by Stack Exchange to build our site the way we want it. The sites tend to follow a pattern, but if all of the sites were practically the same, there would be no need to open up another site. From some work on different sites, each community is different. If it will serve us good, why should we not do it just because Stack Overflow doesn't?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is little more infuriating than posting a question to a SE site, have it closed, try another, have it closed etc. until you have been sent round in a big loop.


















We have the tag https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/megamega. I am almost positive that the OP for the only question so far is referring to the 2560 version of the board. Should we rename it as https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-mega-2560arduino-mega-2560, leave it because most people won't use the old revision, or add https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-mega-originalarduino-mega-original or https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-mega-classicarduino-mega-classic to refer to the original board?

It seems like the original version would still be used some. That's why I like the "original" and "classic" suffixes to the tags so a beginner Arduinoist (is that a word?) who wouldn't know the difference would just use the standard mega tag. However, someone referring to the vintage Arduino board would still be able to ask.


  https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10/how-should-board-revisions-be-handledHow should board revisions be handled? is not a duplicate because the Meta isn't simply a revision, it is just a "makeover" of a fairly popular board to keep the branding.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should "Arduino Mega 2560" be considered a revision of the Mega board?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mm... honestly I think it depends on one thing: would the question be completely changed if it was referring to the old Mega vs. the new Mega? If yes, probably we need a tag for the old one vs. the new one. If not... leave it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I propose the old revision be called [tag:arduino-mega-1280], because that's what he rest of the community calls itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TheDoctor Good idea.


















We already https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/46/who-will-be-the-moderator-what-attributes-should-they-havedecided some attributes that the  moderators should have, now let's start actual nomination.

Actually, knowing Arduino too well is far from necessary. They should
be knowledgeable, yes, but anything more is just a bonus for the
community and their efforts should be focussed as such ;-)
What is needed in a community moderator is the ability to communicate
clearly and effectively, as well as have the patience to handle all
types of members of the community respectfully. Also, to function
impartially even when faced with difficult situations such as that may
happen involving respected members, arguments, flame wars, etc.
Community moderators aren't referred to as janitors for nothing. There
is a fair bit of work to be done behind the scenes, a lot of which may
be fairly involved and taxing. The only reward for this effort is
seeing the site grow and move towards graduation (which can be rather
satisfying :) )
The only thing necessary is that the individual should be active and
involved in the community through content generation, meta
participation, chat availability, editing, reviewing and voting
(close/reopen). Also, in general the individual should be helpful and
guide new members of the community wherever needed.


How do you become a provisional moderator for this site?
Soon after the site launches into "public beta," the Community Team will appoint provisional moderators from this community until the community is ready to hold its own elections (once it graduates from beta).

What do moderators gain?

Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act
as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections
after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator,
they will:

Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.
Organize the process of selecting the site’s attributes (the [help center], site scope, tags, etc.).
Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.

Essentially, they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for
anything we can do to help their sites succeed!


Here's what you should have to be a moderator here:

Have a decent reputation
Participate on Meta
Be well spoken, polite, professional (that includes formatting it with bold and other tags to make it look good and spelling/grammar), and a natural leader.
Be trusted. You'll have some data that a standard user won't. Handel it wisely and follow the TOS and privacy policy of SE.
Have a decent amount of time (30+ minutes a day has been recommended to this site only for "dirty work.")
Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation.

Bonus points for:

Moderator or high-reputation on other sites
Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.
Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.

I also really like his https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/35/hichris123?tab=activityactivity on this site.



Accept

First off, thanks for nominating me. I'd really like to help this site grow and prosper.

I love Arduinos. I (of course) have one at home, tinker with it, and was very excited to find out this site was launching. I'm active on the Stack Exchange network, on sites like Stack Overflow, Meta Stack Overflow, and Space Exploration.

I know quite a bit about moderation from my conversations with mods. Some stuff I don't know; however, I can quickly learn this from the community team and other mods that I know.

I would love to guide this community with a firm, but gentle, hand. I see a lot of potential in this site, and would like to guide it so that we can prosper. We have a lot of great content, but would like to make sure that the bad stuff gets closed or removed from the site. I'd also like to participate more in editing posts/tag wikis, retagging, and overall keeping the site clean. I'm also going to be active on meta, helping to guide this site, as well as being active in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8489/arduinoour chatroom.

How would you respond?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SantaClaus Well, in what place? Like in the comments sections of posts? Or in chat? Or in a different place that I'm not thinking of? :P (side note, please ping me with replies... Undo gets the notifications automatically for this, but not me)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hichris123 Assume I am that _really_ annoying user that posts **comments** everywhere that say `Please help:  www.stackoverflow.com/link/to/badly/formatted/question/`. How would you respond?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SantaClaus That would be an annoying user. ;) So what I'd end up doing is deleting those comments, since they're not relevant to the post. Also, I'd notify the user via chat (mods get this nice thing called superpings, letting you ping people who've never been to chat before) that this behavior isn't allowed, and not to do it again. If it continues... probably a mod message, and maybe suspension, depending on how bad it is, but I'd work with the user in any case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hichris123 Sounds good. Two quick questions: `If you had to compare yourself to a fruit, what would it be and why`, and also `What is your favorite number`. Remember, these are _very_ important questions that determine weather I regret voting for you or not. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SantaClaus Is this part of being a mod, being compared to fruit? ;P Um... for fruit probably a grapefruit because I love grapefruits, and they're actually really amazing and interesting. My favorite number: 42, of course. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We really haven't seen you enough both on main and meta.

Why I feel I'm a good candidate (in bullet points for better SEO :P):


I'm fairly active on meta: 6 questions and four answers. That alone isn't that great, I know. I'm almost ashamed running for moderator with that. However, it's what you can't see that makes me stand out. I https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/posts/31/revisionsgo the extra mile, with 14 edits on one CWiki post, trying to make our tagging get off to a good start.
I am the only user that has fully participated in any of these sites: Robotics, EE, and RPi. These three sites are the ones that are almost guaranteed to have scope conflict. Moderators shape the community, and moderators need to be informed. I'm definitely informed.
I try hard, and never give up. I want this site to succeed. I was the part of the Arduino beta last time, and I was annoyed when it was shut down. I'll do what it takes to get us through beta. I need to shape my little corner of the world. It's my calling, my duty, and my responsibility.



  Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
  The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things
  differently.
  
  They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status
  quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
  
  About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change
  things. They push the human race forward.
  
  And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
  
  Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the
  world, are the ones who do.


I may be a crazy round peg who sees things differently, but that doesn't mean I'm stupid.


I will rewrite the Arduino engine to use jQuery (just kidding)
You can eat a waffle if I'm moderator any time of the day! MMM waffles... nom nom nom.  Waffles... yummy! Unless you like pancakes better.
I will do a full cleanup of the tags (already kinda messy but that's natural with any beta)
I am a grammar and spelling jerk natzi (not to be offensive to anyone, it's an American English thing) freak loving person.

Why I shouldn't Be a Moderator*

*Yes, the first time in recorded history I did actually do that in a moderator election.


I prefer pancakes Not really... no need for all the controversy, @Undo!!! :P
I haven't ever used moderational tools or had full edit capability (exception: last Arduino beta for editing without approval). However, I adapt quickly.
I probably might not always have time to put in 10 hours a day. I'll try to do at least 30 minutes daily to empty the queues. I do have a https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/220/annonomus-person?tab=activityseven page activity log, though. I don't know if I have the patience or time to be in chat 24/7 either, but I'll try. I am now the biggest user of http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8489/arduinoPin 13 (A.K.A. Arduino Chatroom).


Despite the above, I feel that I would be a legendary moderator. I have vision, dedication, and perseverance. If you elect me, I can almost guarantee that I will make this proposal live. I'm a trustworthy person who will make this site succeed. EDIT: As time progresses I seem like the more ideal moderator.

No Arduinos hurt in the making of this.

Oops! –`). You got to be nice and fair to be a decent moderator.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo I was referring to his *[EE Profile](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/28996/peter-r-bloomfield)*. ;) I never intended for it to be rude, but looking back it could be interpreted a few different ways.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok. I'll take back my downvote in appreciation for your retraction. Knowing when to apologize *is* a desired characteristic of a great moderator. Just gotta be *extra careful* with what you write, especially if you want to be a moderator. One lousy comment here and there is ok for regular users but not for mods.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nope, can't remove the downvote unless you edit your nomination.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo I updated some numbers... you don't have to remove it though if you don't want to. If you would rather have the others be moderators, I would favor the community being better off than me getting moderator.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No sweat! I'm sure you'll be a great moderator, as all other folks who were nominated. We all want this site to be the best it can be. I guess that being a mod has it's own learning curve. This was just one step up the ladder.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo Thanks for your support! Note: [there are always mod decisions that aren't supported...](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/119/190823) :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice try, but he is Jeff Atwood, the StackOverflow and StackExchange founder, mod of the mods. He is [the Dangeon Master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(TV_series)#Protagonists). He has the luxury of being unpopular sometimes. We don't ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Next will you compare yourself to [Jon Skeet](http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet), [the Chuck Norris of SO](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9134/jon-skeet-facts)? :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo Yes he is forgiven, but really, [-192 votes](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/915/can-we-have-the-ability-to-retract-a-close-vote-before-it-closes/33949#33949)? That's pushing his luck.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can have my vote if you agree to not clutter the site with large pictures of waffles that make answers longer than they rightfully should be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Santa Sorry about that... I was just hungry! :) Anyway, I won't do that. When I add pictures, they are usually relevant (with an exception of this one here).

I am a good candidate because...

I really want this site to succeed. I started electronics with Arduino and I want to help other people, beginners or otherwise, get off to a good start, too. I'm very active on the site, and I like to think my answers provide a examples of what a "good" answer looks like.

Some examples:


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/408/why-does-my-sketch-report-too-many-button-presses/411#411Why does my sketch report too many button presses?
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/261/serial-data-showing-up-weird/262#262Serial data showing up weird


I also make an effort to stay on top of the review queue. I have some experience with this from SO, where I have over 1000 edits and hundreds of other review related tasks. I bring over the same habit to Arduino.SE. I'm on the site every day trying to help wherever I can.

Check out my https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/11/sachleen?tab=activityrecent activity on the site to see what I'm up to.

What sets you apart from the other candidates here? - Annonomus Person

There are a handful of people here that are just as capable as me and would make excellent moderators. I'm not trying to win votes, I trying to help the site succeed. I will continue to use the tools available to me to make the site a better place, moderator, or not.

profile for Peter R. Bloomfield on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&A sites http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/2918160.png




Why me?
I believe I'm a good candidate because I have past experience of managing/moderating online communities (mostly forums). I also have an academic background, with a few publications in the computing field, so I can communicate well in writing.

I believe in being civil and respectful, and that we should strive to make newcomers feel comfortable here. I always aim to remain objective in the face of disputes and disagreements. With that said, I know that it's sometimes necessary to take a hard line.

I've been a little hesitant to nominate myself for a moderator role, simply because I'm fairly busy already. Realistically though, I should certainly be able to average at least 30 minutes per day without any difficulty.



More about me
I'm one of those weird people who somehow still enjoys programming, despite doing it 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. By day, I'm a professional Software Engineer; hardcore C++ is my proverbial bread and butter. My focus as a research/programmer over the past several years has been educational technology and virtual environments.

I've had to do a little embedded systems work at my job, but electronics is mostly just a hobby. I find Arduino to be an excellent platform, because it can provide a fairly gentle introduction to the area, but it's also very capable for more advanced projects.

I should maybe note that there is actually more to my life than just computers. I have other interests too! I'll stop rambling now though. :) If there are any questions, feel free to ask.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You seem to have a lot of experience with coding, but not much with EE. Arduino needs both: can you adjust to make up that gap?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson experience and knowledge with the subject can be helpful for a moderator and shouldn't be ignored, but you don't have to be an expert on the subject to be a candidate. Judging by Peter's contributions around the site thus far, I think he's a fantastic candidateb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson The EE stuff I've done in my job (and am still doing) is actually a sizeable bare-metal AVR project, interfacing with multiple external systems. It really goes much deeper than I suspect most Arduino.SE visitors are likely to need.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterR.Bloomfield Sorry I'm just looking at the EE.SE profile of yours... :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson I'd completely forgotten that I'd created one! I've never really had to refer to EE.SE as a questioner, and I don't think I have enough to contribute there as an answerer (compared to EE professionals).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @AnnonomusPerson that some EE knowledge is essential for any good Arduino.SE moderator. As a measurement, I was looking for good answers from the candidates on SE.EE. If he or she manages to post a few great answers there and not getting beaten up much, I figure the candidate at least know what a great answer is when he or she sees it. While Annonomus Person meets that requirement, his last comment doesn't make him a worthy moderator candidate. While Peter doesn't pass that SE.EE requirement, he's got a good amount of activity in Ar.SE and shows he's nice and fair. My vote is his.


















Should we support tags of specific boards like the UDOO & Raspberry Pi? While a Raspberry Pi is different from an Arduino, the UDOO essentially is an Arduino Due and LInux Quad-core computer integrated into one device with shared processor communication. With that being said currently the UDOO has some issues with their IDE that doesn't allow certain Arduino Due related things to work properly. One of the main issues currently is that floats compile, but don't work properly on the Due and just crash the board.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Support for UDOO & Integrated Arduino Boardsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you saying I won't be able to run a UDOO program on Due or a Due program on UDOO?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Raspberry Pi is definitely not on topic... try http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These kind of questions can be asked now at: [Embedded Systems](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/70800/embedded-systems) which is currently in private beta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sachleen once the float problem is fixed there will be no difference. Until then due code uploaded to the UDOO through their internal ide might not work. But if uploaded like a normal due it'll work.


















I think we could treat the UDOO as an "Arduino compatible" device, as per https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22/is-it-ok-to-ask-questions-about-arduino-compatible-micros-not-clonesthis question. That means questions about the Arduino side of it would be relevant. However, if somebody is asking a wholly non-Arduino question about it (e.g. about its integrated graphics) then it should probably be considered off-topic.

The Raspberry Pi would seem to be off-topic as a general rule, as it's not trying to be Arduino compatible at all. Admittedly, there will probably be exceptions, e.g. where somebody is trying to program an Arduino from a Raspberry Pi (maybe via Gertboard or something).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about the specific IDE glitches abs other UDOO issues even attempting to program the Due connected to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it's a problem with UDOO's own IDE, then I suspect it's probably off-topic here.


















This is enabled, and on by default in the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming tag.

You can use https://arduino.stackexchange.com/editing-help#syntax-highlightinglanguage hints to fine-tune the highlighting if the defaults aren't acceptable.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks Shog. I wonder if it ought to be extended to all questions though? I suspect there will be several instances where we need to include code of some kind, even when the question isn't directly about programming.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As I said, you can use the language hints for more precise control of this - including enabling highlighting in posts where it wouldn't otherwise occur. A moderator here (once you have them) can set defaults on other tags if need-be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about Arduino specific support? Arduino is in itself [a language](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction#.Uw4Wdh-BVWN), of sorts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We use [Prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for highlighting. If it ain't supported by Prettify, it ain't supported here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shog9 Why isn't the highlighting working here: http://arduino.stackexchange.com/q/692/275 I edited in the language hint plus added the *programming* tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looks fine to me, @Philipb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shog9 True, now it does. Although I am not sure whether it's thanks to the `programming` tag or the language hint. Could it be, that as long as an edit is under review, even I cannot see the syntax highlighting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shog9 Simply adding the language hint doesn't seem to work as proven here: http://arduino.stackexchange.com/q/699/275b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Needs to be on its own line, not abutting the previous paragraph, @Philip.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Shog9 Ah, thanks. Good to know. Perhaps a respective note should be added to the *language hints markdown page*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very interesting approach, but often code is included but is not the core of the question so the OP might not think to use that tag.   Also, how many more tags trigger special operations here?  Can we add a LaTex tag to allow us to describe things mathematically?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure what you're asking in the first part of your comment, @SDsolar. As for LaTeX, yes that can be enabled here *if* it would be routinely useful; you can post a separate request with examples of posts where such formulas would be beneficial.


















I've noticed a couple of instances of minor profanity on the site, mainly in comments. It's not been directed at anyone, nor has it been particularly vulgar. However, it's definitely into territory which some people would consider somewhat offensive, or at least unprofessional.

How should we respond to instances like these?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to handle bad language?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/22600/16472


















As is important in any such discussion, what did you see? It is near impossible to discuss such issues without looking at specific instances.

In any case, the normal policy applies. If directed at an individual or group, flag as offensive, be it a question, answer or a comment. You may edit it out if you so wish, but it is best to bring it to the attention of moderators, so such users may be explained how things work here, and if needed further action may be taken. 

In cases of general use of inappropriate language, edit it out and/or flag for moderator attention.

Most of this is very clearly mentioned in the Help Center.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Still the Arduino stack is less than a month/quarter/year and these numbers are incorrect. Only 'all' shows correct numbers. My association bonus is dated Feb 12, I'd expect to see it in the month view. Good news is that the rep is not entirely lost.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jippie As I said, the association bonus isn't included (on purpose) in the views that aren't "all".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah I missed that sentence. Thnx for explaining.


















Private beta is not the best time to concentrate on reputation and other competitive things. They are meant to build a critical mass of questions, answers, and users with a bit of experience in the site. I would imagine that the leagues won't start until public beta. As far as I know, we've only been in public beta a few hours, so I would give it a bit more time.

When they do start, though, they should be at http://stackexchange.com/leagues/272http://stackexchange.com/leagues/272.

Edit: The link is now there at the bottom of https://arduino.stackexchange.com/usersthe Users page. It goes to http://stackexchange.com/leagues/288/week/arduinohttp://stackexchange.com/leagues/288/week/arduino, which does not currently exist.

This was not meant as a complaint, but rather I simply wanted to bring it to everyone's attention (or more correctly the people taking care of those matters) to ensure that once this community becomes permanent, it is fixed to prevent others from "real" complaints. And yes: We are officially in public beta since a few hours.


















A couple I thought of off the top of my head:


  Pin 13


Pin 13 is a symbolic pin, mostly because it is the first pin ever used. You did want to be friendly to new users and attract them.


  #define HIGH LOW


Good luck debugging!!!


  digitalWrite(13, MEDIUM);


Who said that we had to have rules in the chat? :)



Some bad ideas:

What we shouldn't do.


  Hacker's __


Arduino users are more than hackers only. We are artists, designers, hackers, hobbyists (like me!), and more.



If this post didn't help, at least we established that I should not be put in charge of naming anything. However, the point about "hacker" in the name (or any other name that suggests geekyness) should be avoided at all costs is pretty important. Sure we are geeks, but the whole Arduino community is a lot more.

I would say no. Arduino really has nothing to do with it. It's all configuration in the 3rd party software to match the Arduino's configuration.

This may be on topic:


  How do I configure my Arduino's serial port with the following
  settings?


This is not:


  How do I configure this software to communicate with a device which
  uses the following serial configuration?


See how I said "device" instead of "Arduino"? Changing Arduino there doesn't change the question in any way.



I realized you may be referring to questions like https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/140/how-can-i-communicate-arduino-to-matlabHow can I communicate Arduino to Matlab. Still, the underlying question is how to interface a serial device with MatLab, which really has nothing to do with Arduino specifically.

Even in that question, the first comment is


  Do you need help writing the code for the Arduino, or help writing
  MATLAB code to read data input from the serial stream?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In general, I'd agree. If it's clear that the question is nothing to do with Arduino then it's off-topic. Judging by Arduino questions on SO though, the distinction may not always be clear. E.g. a lot of hobbyists seem to like connecting Android or Processing to Arduino via serial, and when they have a problem it may not be obvious (at least to them) where that problem actually lies.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[I was referring to this as well.](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/q/38/65).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sachleen - here's one force-migrated here from SO that is ultimately another example of "how do I write a program on my desktop to talk to my arduino" that thus probably belongs there rather than here. http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1358/arduino-serial-communication


















How about something named after the Serial library? E.g.:

Serial.begin


Putting it without the parameter list seems a little nicer.

Or something a little more on-the-nose:

Serial.print("chat");


It's the kind of thing that any Arduino user is likely to recognise, but it's also not totally alien to anybody else who's done any programming. Admittedly, it's maybe less likely to hook EE folks though.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How about `Serial.begin(chat)`?


















To answer my own question, I think we shouldn't vote to close a question unless it's glaring obvious that the question must be closed (as off-topic for example). 

If it's not obvious, then the reviewer MUST explain why the question must be closed in a comment. Link answers don't count here. There must be an explanation. If you want to close the question, you must show effort, too!

If the post is too large to fit in a comment, just give up, answer the question and leave it open. If it takes that much effort to explain why the question must be closed, there's got to be something about it that involves Arduinos that is of interest of this community.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think I did explain why I voted to put on hold (if that was directed at me).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR - don't get me wrong, I'm not directing this at you. My complaint is more general. I wanted people to think twice before quickly voting to close a question and reflect if they could instead make a better contribution by either editing the question to make it on-topic or to just answering the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Generally the first action would be to *comment* the question, mentioning the fact it look off-topic and **challenging** the OP to edit it to make it clearer that is can be considered on-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo For most cases it's fine to close it if it's too vague. If edited within a few days, **it's automatically reviewed.** There's no reason to leave a vague question open just because it could be edited. Questions that aren't fixed should be closed and reopened if needed so we don't get many open ended answers or answers that are opinionated. Plus, links are fine if they sum it up in a few sentences.


















Questions that appear to be borderline off-topic should either:


Be edited and improved to be made on-topic (by the OP or any user that understands the problem well)
Be voted to close (put "On Hold")


The first action is preferable of course, but when not possible, we should not  hesitate from voting to close. The entire closing interface was recently redesigned to be far more simpler and easier to understand with greater emphasis on editing and reopening. The current behavior is that the question stays "On Hold" for an initial period of 7 days, during which it can be made clearer, edited and improved; and automatically get pushed into the reopen queue. The "On Hold" status clearly signals that it is a temporary state and can be lifted after improvements

In this specific example, I really can't see how this is "on the line". The question is specifically asking how to develop a software layer on Windows to utilize input being sent using the serial connection. 

Lastly, to answer point by point.


  we should give it a chance as it someone knowledgeable could add facts that could reveal that the question is on-topic.


Yes, there is. But the OP is not interested in trying that out, as is clearly mentioned in the comments. 


  Although putting a question on-hold is a useful quality assurance tool, I think it was misused in this particular example, as putting a question on hold also discourages knowledgeable people from answering it, and I would like very much to know the answer to it even if the answer is just what you are saying (on the windows side).


A question about Windows APIs would best be answered on Windows development forums. That is not a question for Arduino.SE


  Instead of voting for closing, the reviewers could have edited or answered the question so that us readers would understand better why the question isn't related to Arduinos and why it's being closed. That would have been much more constructive than voting for closing it.


I explained albeit in few words, as to why the question was off-topic. I do not think this was at all a problem in this case. 

Moreover, in general, the new help center consists of extremely well-written content accumulated from community-generated posts, which does not necessitate the need for comments explaining whats wrong with a question, every time a question is closed.

I'm Nominating: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/65/asheeshrAsheeshR

http://stackexchange.com/users/1609527/asheeshrprofile for AsheeshR on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&A sites http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/1609527.png
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/65/asheeshr





I think Asheesh is a great candidate because he meets all the criteria specified in the nomination, more specifically, those below:


He's got a decent reputation
He participates on Meta
He's well spoken, polite, professional (that includes formatting it with bold and other tags to make it look good and spelling/grammar), and a natural leader.
He can be trusted.
He's already shown that he's got a decent amount of time to dedicate to us (30+ minutes a day has been recommended to this site only for "dirty work.")
He's got high-reputation on other sites
He's got Area 51 participation
He's a member who has already shown an interest or ability to promote our community.
And he's very knowledgeable about Arduinos.


My vote is his.



Thanks for the nomination. I would enjoy working on the site and taking it forward. I participate in a few beta sites which has gotten me a fair bit of experience with regards to what works, and what doesn't. I am sure that this experience will help in carrying out the work that will be needed.

This post *almost* made me want to vote for myself :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR - Well, you deserve them. Too bad you didn't get elected. I guess the problem was the timing: just like regular questions, those who answer first have higher chances of getting upvoted and accepted. But I'm sure you'll keep acting as a moderator, so we are all winning anyway :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR - Since I nominated you, I could't vote for you because the system didn't let me. So I was counting that *you* would vote for yourself and that would count as my vote. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Somebody else voted for you, besides you and me, then.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR - Next time, you, sir, nominate yourself right when the nomination period opens. If someone nominates you, you make sure you vote for yourself. In elections, every vote counts. You're young so you will have to brag about yourself to get great jobs, so start practicing *ASAP*.


















Hi everybody! I'm the owner of the chatroom http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8489/pin-13Pin 13 (formerly Arduino). It was automatically assigned to me after my record of high activity on the chat room. Anyway, there is a option to add new events that show up.



I don't have to schedule a event, but this is our main chat room and I think it would be cool to do something. Additionally, the chat wouldn't be any different except a few notices to remind people about the event. Everyone can chat about normal topics, if they choose. It should last at least 24 hours for different timezones.

Should we have anything on our chat room? If so, what should we do? Please include a title for it and if it should be a regular occurrence.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have events in Pin 13?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pin 13 doesn't support external interrupt events.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We should call our events vectors, after the interrupt vectors on the AVR CPU


















Something that I thought of:


  Site Improvement Day


Anyone anytime can improve the site, but we should focus that day on how we can make it better. Be it retagging, cleaning up comments, or even just asking some new questions if the site suffers inactivity, let's get working!

This could be a bi-weekly or monthly event. People can always do things like above, but we can use the room to chart our progress and maintain our site, as well as review the healthiness of the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to clarify, by "bi-weekly" you mean every 2 weeks, right? In some places, it can mean twice a week.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peter Yes, two weeks (~2 per month) not every 3.5 days...


















During the last iteration, we had a weekly meetup lasting half an hour every week for about 2 to 3 weeks in which there were 5-10 people participating. It usually went on for almost an hour however. That was, in my opinion quite successful, and I think we could try something similar.


  Weekly Meetup


The discussion can be kept open and spanning a range of topics. It does help if a single person takes the lead, and develops at least some sort of list of topics to discuss, and prevents the discussion from getting fixated on a single issue. It is likely that if we end up discussing a single specific issue for 30 minutes then, it would be better suited to a meta post than a chat discussion.

The event could be called Setup() && Chat() 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could you recommend a name and a when to do it (Sunday, etc.) please?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Annonomous The time needs to be discussed and decided collectively by the people interested in participating. My suggestion won't help if no one is available at that time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or `void setup() { chat(); }`


















I've noticed that a new user (who admittedly has lot of rep on other SE sites) has been re-tagging some programming questions to include the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++ tag.

These are the questions so far:


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/429/last-element-of-a-struct-disappearingLast element of a struct disappearing on write/read
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/493/sprintf-locks-up-arduino-yunsprintf() to assemble String and float pieces locks up
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/518/is-it-better-to-use-c-str-or-tochararrayIs it better to use c_str or toCharArray?
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/506/is-it-better-to-use-define-or-const-int-for-constantsIs it better to use #define or const int for constants?


Given that the vast majority of programming on Arduino is in C++, it seems like a somewhat redundant tag in many cases. With that said, I am sure there are cases where it actually is relevant though.

When should we tag with https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++, and when is the programming tag sufficient on its own?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When should we use the C++ tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I approved an edit to my question as it was very specifically about a difference between C and C++.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Cybergibbons Likewise, I approved it on my question about c_str and toCharArray, because it relates back to the standard C++ language. I'm not sure about more general cases though.


















First off, thanks to everyone who participated at the https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/79/provisional-community-moderator-nominationsProvisional Community Moderator Nominations meta post.
I may eventually be contacting additional users to fill more moderator slots, but I wanted to get the folks below activated before things really started to take off.
Throughout the beta, we need members from this site whose focus is to engage the community, both in community-building issues and site management. That's why we select a few members from each community to act as temporary, provisional Moderators. You can read about the program here: https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/Moderators Pro Tempore.
I am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that this community’s issues are properly addressed:
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/220/annonomus-person
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/42/peter-r-bloomfield
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/11/sachleen
We want to make this site a huge success, and these members are great examples of exactly the type of people we need to make this site succeed. Please welcome them for the hard work and time they contribute.
Did I overlook anyone?
Yes, almost certainly. At the nomination post alone, there were more great choices than positions available. There are members who are actively involved and very deserving of recognition. My inability to account for everyone this early on is in no way a slight against them. Ideally, Moderators are elected by the community and that's why you'll have your elections several weeks after graduation.
Most of all, be respectful and understanding of the Moderators Pro Tem. Members of your community are volunteering their time and learning on the job. It’s a learning experience for everyone.

The relevant documentation on this is confusing at best.

The https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/behaviorbehaviour page has the notice: Please note that expletives are not allowed. If you use expletives on this site, you  may be issued a warning or a suspension.

However, the may be issued a warning or a suspension. portion of the page is a direct link to a https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22232/are-expletives-allowed-on-se-sitesmeta question about "profanity" on stack-exchange in general that directly disagrees with the linking text. In response to the question  Are expletives allowed on SE sites?, the highest-voted answer is Yes, but keep them to a minimum. 

As far as I can tell, I would assume the behaviour page is out of date, since it seems the community consensus disagrees with it.

The expletives issue is basically a rule across all SE sites, rather than a community-driven decision.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterR.Bloomfield - In that case, where is the threshold? Shit? S**t? &%$&?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Generally speaking, the rule seems to be no expletives at all, in any form. Personally, I'm not intending to chase after the milder stuff like "hell" or "crap" (unless it's getting flagged a lot by users, or it's used somewhere very visible like a question title). Anything stronger than that will have to be removed though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterR.Bloomfield - It seems to me like you're reading a lot into those rules. Again, Is S**t ok? #$%!?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Partially- or fully-censored expletives are still expletives, so please don't use them. They shouldn't be necessary for communicating anything constructive (and anything not constructive shouldn't be posted on the site).


















We have established a repository having some excellent questions. Its now time to get the word out about Arduino. There are many people in the online world who manage very active and productive blogs. These individuals have a lot of referral power. They can help us reach new audiences and gain more members for our community.

If you're a blogger, or if you know a blogger, who may be interested in picking one of our most interesting questions, blogging about the topic, and then referring the readers to our site, please mention them below.

Also, share any ideas you may have about how to get them interested in the site (if they aren't already!)

It makes sense to bring good content to the table when you bring it to the attention of the main Arduino team.


















From the http://day.arduino.cc/official Arduino site:

Arduino Day is a worldwide celebration of Arduino’s first 10 years. It's 24 hours full of events – both official and independent, anywhere around the world – where people interested in Arduino can meet, share their experiences, and learn more.
Who can participate?
Arduino invites all Arduino user groups, makerspaces, hackerspaces, fablabs, associations, teachers, pros, and newbies to participate. Let’s make this the biggest birthday party yet!

Arduino Day is on the 29th of March. What can we do to join in on the worldwide event?

(Updated 3/19/14)](http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/153/project-showcase-14-is-coming-to-arduino-stack-exchange-updated-3-19-14)


















I won't come as a newbie on a forum and give lessons to the people who built it, but that question, should not be closed because of what it is asking, because what it asks is definitely possible using AVR only code, cf my https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/484/arduino-as-usb-hid#comment845_484comment.

I guess I'd need to do a little bit of research on how to guide the OP on actually implementing that, because I guess most of the people doing USB HID devices use the leonardo, not the uno.

The only thing that would be wrong about the question, is how it looks like, and maybe encourage the OP to edit and improve it by giving him time and advices.


  In this specific example, I really can't see how this is "on the line". The question is specifically asking how to develop a software layer on Windows to utilize input being sent using the serial connection. 


it's actually not, only part 1 of the question is, but part 2 of the question is open to suggestions.


  
    we should give it a chance as it someone knowledgeable could add facts that could reveal that the question is on-topic.
    Yes, there is. But the OP is not interested in trying that out, as is clearly mentioned in the comments. 
  


the OP only said in the comments that he is afraid of flashing using DFU because he may brick his stuff. That's because he does not know he can actually build a cheap ISP board using another arduino to reflash it in case everything gets wrong!


  
    [...]
    A question about Windows APIs would best be answered on Windows development forums. That is not a question for Arduino.SE
  


though the OP asks whether it's possible to do it using Windows stuff, wouldn't it be the role of an Arduino community to tell him that he actually can do using the Arduino hardware and no windows code? Which would make that an even better solution, as it would be portable!


  I explained albeit in few words, as to why the question was off-topic. I do not think this was at all a problem in this case.


I do not agree a question that definitely has an answer should be put on hold for one week in a few minutes after posting. If I could, I'd definitely vote for reopen, and guide the OP to understand what's wrong in his question.

Question closing/holding/rerouting is for keeping the knowledge base sane by keeping track of dupes, moving questions where people might get an answer or delete questions that are offending or just totally un-answerable.

That question applies to non of those cases, it can be answered and is definitely interesting for future readers of the forum.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All of us here are newbies as far as [Arduino.se] is concerned, and everyone's opinion is welcome. However, I disagree with your answer for reasons mentioned in [my post.](http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/a/104/65)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I strongly disagree with your post, because you assume that the OP *wants* to do windows stuff, whereas he only says he *prefers* to use windows stuff and he's *afraid* of bricking the arduino doing DFU updates. As a community we shall guide the OP through that to show him that he's wrong and should'nt be afraid! *Au contraire*, putting his question on hold only shows him that he shall get on the wrong direction and will try to implement some terrible windows hack that is very likely to never work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just a note: The bricking concern is **very real.** It is pretty hard to get hold of Atmega chips and other components depending on where you live. For example, in my city, there is just **one shop** which keeps Atmegas in stock. Online purchases can take a week or more, as well as, can turn out to be expensive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the bricking concern **is not real**. The only way you can brick an AVR is by fooling around the fuses, and reset all the programming fuses, and even that can be solved by using HVSP. Otherwise, you can **always** reflash a firmware using the ICSP headers and an AVR flasher, whether it is an [arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP) or an [atmel one](http://www.atmel.com/tools/avrispmkii.aspx).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeshR and zmo - While I agree with zmo, let's cal it quits and agree to disagree? What I think we should learn from this case is that, if there's controversy like in this case, **let's give the question and the OP the benefit of the doubt and leave the question open**, shall we?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Here's [a question I posted on EE.SE 2 days ago](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/101191/why-should-i-use-a-logarithmic-pot-for-audio-applications)  that's a good example of what I'm talking about. Right after I posted it, it quickly got a few votes to close as off-topic. Then a fierce discussion ensued (see comments). In the end, the question was not closed (but still has 3 votes to close), it's got 15 upvotes, and got 1k views in 2 days. It even figured as a hot question of all stacks (continues below...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, the question was now considered on-topic, but it ran the risk of being closed by some that quickly vote to close them. I'm not arguing against closing obviously off-topic, shopping recommendations, opinion based questions. Those should be quickly closed. But if there's any doubt as to whether the question is on-topic, specially if it is because the question concerns only programming (or not), let's give the question a chance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since we now found somebody more knowledgeable (than me) to argue in favor of that question being on-topic, I'll accept this answer as it agrees more with my beliefs.


















Definitely change it to the main site now. Don't delete it as it's good promotion of the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's down at the bottom in small print. Should i change this also?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TheDoctor Yes, definitely. (As long as you don't get in any trouble) It is good advertising and we need traffic, especially since currently we're not in Google.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, edited! http://playground.arduino.cc/


















AskUbuntu was launched by Stack Exchange and Canonical and is now linked to prominently from the top bar of Ubuntu.com



Ask Ubuntu is also linked to from the installation GUI. This is beneficial for the site as it generates a lot of traffic. 

I think we should also aim for more visibility within the Arduino platform.

We should be here:


Also, if you open the Arduino IDE, it links back to Arduino.cc from the Help menu. We should be there as well, alongside Arduino.cc

Both of these however, are more long term goals, and will most likely require the support of Stack Exchange, due to Arduino trademark issues.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's outside my range of edificationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Found this question again, but the reason it's there is because Canonical had a special agreement with SE. I'm sure if Arduino SE permitted, we could get that, but (as of now) we aren't any official support.


















We had a discussion in the http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8489/pin-13Pin 13 chat room after https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/548/i-cant-create-an-arduino-librarythis question was posted about http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/14061889#14061889starting a Q&A series.

This question is asking a very broad question that can't (and shouldn't) be covered in one answer. AsheeshR suggested the following:


  For the library case, we could broadly cover: 
  
  
  How do i create the files? (done) 
  How do convert a sketch into a C library? 
  How do I convert a sketch into a C++ library? 
  How do I package a library and share it with others?
  
  
  The second question could further be broken down to:
  
  
  How do variables interact amongst a .cpp and .h file?
  How do function definitions in a .cpp and .h file work?
  How do I hide local functions in my .cpp file?
  
  
  etc.


http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/14061931#14061931chat transcript

How interested would you guys be in doing a series like this?

What are some other ideas for a Q&A series?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Q&A Series Ideasb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**Don't do things covered in many tutorials.** Try to stay away from resistors or LEDs; those are *everywhere* on the web. If you want to go into a rotary encoder or a LCD display, go ahead. Try not to duplicate basic content.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, [I agree](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/14061889#14061889) [entirely](http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/a/91/65) with @AnnonomusPerson . We should do these in cases where the available tutorials are poor, and we have some value to add (i.e. write a better guide, or maybe fill in gaps in existing tutorials).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The second question seems clearly outside the scope of arduino.SE since it is purely related to C++. The first question is more related to Arduino (IDE in particular), although bullets 2 and 3 would be more about program design (and OOO-design for bullet 3)


















There doesn't seem to be a "respected" Arduino individual that I know of*

*There are a few blogs with a lot of respect but are managed by multiple people. If there was one, single respected person, he/she would probably be posted here already.


http://hackaday.com/Hack a Day: They post about many fun and creative projects, from automatic flame throwing pumpkins, to DIY heat cameras. I don't know if this is the thing that they would blog about... it's more of a "hard core EE" site. Some beginners that know a lot in other areas but not in Arduino might come here if anything's posted. Also, we might be able to gain some more advanced users and/or questions. EDIT: http://hackaday.com/2014/03/09/ask-hackaday-wiping-your-bum-with-an-arduino/We were mentioned on this blog!
http://makezine.comMAKE: They post a lot of beginner oriented projects and tutorials. They also have a http://www.makershed.com/?gclid=CMam6N-d9bwCFeY-MgodeQgAUQstore and a magazine. Again, they wouldn't probably won't just put a link in.
http://lifehacker.comLifehacker: They post mainly tips for the geeky person. If you don't read it, I would recommend it. This one would be hardest to get a link only: but I have an idea to get it on one of this sites...




How do we get a link on a site that big?

We don't, really. We need to generate great content of how to do something, find a clever solution, and send it in to one of those. For Hack a Day, the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/564/design-question-how-to-alarm-when-toilet-paper-is-lowtoilet paper question might get mentioned if it generates a great answer. Make probably would need a good tutorial on how to do something that they could rewrite with pictures (and throw in a link). Lifehacker?: Anything that would make your life more productive and is fairly easy to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourselfDIY, even for a software kind-of-guy.



I doubt that we could get a mention on all of the sites above.

You wanted a list of "prominent" blogs in the community, I gave you what are read often. (Making it a wiki: edit this list if you want to.) But I think if we work hard, we can get something on a popular site.

But wait... there's more!

One thing often overlooked is http://www.wikipedia.org/Wikipedia. Seriously. Sometimes, Wikipedia comes before the actual site in Google. We currently aren't ranked on Google. If someone was Googling something along the lines of, *arduino forum site***, Wikipedia may come up on the first page due to its high http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimizationSEO. I think we should try all of the above sites, but Wikipedia doesn't need any real approval to be posted about. It has great SEO, and we might even get up into Google sooner than without (with cross-linking sites). Note: I'm no expert at SEO, so correct me if I'm wrong anybody.

**Although I hate this, we should probably put some mention about being a forum in the Wikipedia article. It'll get better ranking in Google. We could probably even do:


  Arduino Stack Exchange is similar to a forum, but it is categorized as a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_question-and-answer_websitesQuestion and answer site. Foo bar blah blah...

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are there *any* SE sites other than the trilogy([so], [su], [sf]) that have Wikipedia posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AsheeR Yes, [Ask Ubuntu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask_Ubuntu). I'm surprised the pages aren't better maintained... or at least for all sites out of beta. Even the main Stack Exchange page is pretty dull.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Annonomus Person: regarding "form" in "Arduino form site", "being a form in", and "similar to a form": Do you mean "forum"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterMortensen Yep.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For what its worth, I added a link on wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino a few day ago and its still standing. (It took me a few days to build up enough points to comment here)


















Here is one way:
http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/04/helping-the-experts-get-answers/Helping the Experts Get Answers

In http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/a-recipe-to-promote-your-site/A Recipe to Promote your Site, Robert provided a great set of guidelines for organically growing your Q&A community. Buried within was this observation:

Reach the right kind of publications and bloggers. Make sure that the key experts in every field know about the site; not just the “Martha Stewart” big names; we want to talk to the people who go to these conferences.

But how do you reach writers, bloggers, and other notable experts in the field?
Help them get answers to their questions, too!

When a blogger or other publisher/expert has a problem, say to yourself, "hey, there’s a site for that!" — then go ahead and ask the the question on their behalf… and send them what you find.
If you continue to provide excellent answer like you have been, you have a pretty good chance of adding a valuable member and evangelist to this community for a long time to come.

This might be a good way to promote our site. Unfortunately, I don't have a Twitter account and haven't bothered creating one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I use Twitter occasionally. I tweeted about this site just now, and tagged the official Arduino feed in it. Hopefully it'll get re-tweeted and word will spread. :)


















The Arduino Yún board, has an accent in it's name.

Unless you're using a modified/Spanish/Italian keyboard, it's hard to add the accent. It obviously isn't a huge deal, but I thought it might be something to think about. Could we:


Just ignore it? (Note: I didn't tag it /questions/tagged/feature-requestfeature-request if we wanted to ignore it)
Add an accent symbol on the toolbar?
Have some sort of script that automatically renames the instances of "Yun"




Technically, we're misspelling a board's name on purpose. Is this even a big deal?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we get a way to accent Yún?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it's a huge deal. I don't know how hard it is to add a toolbar button but I still don't think it adds too much/any value.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is probably not worth the effort. It is unlikely there will be any confusion without the accent on *Yun*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think it is a big deal, but it is _nice_ to get things looking right... regardless, we have three excellent examples, in the answers below, as to how to obtain a "ú".... :-)


















If you're working on Windows, try holding the left Alt key and type 163 on the numpad (the cluster of number keys at the right-hand side of many conventional keyboards). That should give you the accented ú character.

It may only work on American/British English systems.

For laptops/notebooks, you may have to enable num lock or similar to use part of the main keyboard as a numpad.

If you are using Mac OS. You can get the accent by pressing 


  alt+e followed by u.


I don't see a special need for an extra icon in the toolbar.

  Project Showoff Day/Week!


Arduino hackers are almost always working on creating something interesting. Lets have an event inviting users to post pictures and descriptions of their coolest  projects, and we could drool over discuss them. 

To participate, the user must post:


Atleast one picture (necessary)
Video link on Youtube (optional)
Aim of the project
Basic breakdown of components
Short description or video^ of working


The projects can be anything but must utilise an Arduino board. 



This could be done on either main, meta or chat. After a http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8489/conversation/arduino-day-discussiondiscussion with Peter, we are leaning towards holding this on a single question on main.

The timeline could also be longer, encompassing a week starting from 23th and culminating on 29th.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Having discussed this on chat, I think it sounds like a good idea. It would hopefully be a good way to encourage new folks to sign up and post their projects.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't really know about the *must utilise an Arduino board.* It might be better to say it must use any microcontroller that an official board contains. Size may be an issue with an official board.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ok say I participate and created something original, how would I know that  someone here won't steal my idea? can we have some copyright?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Fischer http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225488/200868


















While I wholly support the idea, it may be too early to direct attention on a blog before we even establish a core community of users for the site itself. The site is about Q&A first and foremost, and that needs a fair bit of focus for now. 
Even the Photography contest you link to was started almost 2 years after the site went into its public beta.

A once a week or month event in chat would be a good starting point to move towards a full-fledged vote and blog event. In fact, I posted https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/126/65this idea on another discussion.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the idea of a one-off event with plenty of build-up time, which could evolve into something regular if it goes well. I might suggest Meta rather than chat to start with as it's easier to link to, easier to browse/compare entries, and better shows off the SE format for any experienced Arduino people who aren't used to SE (i.e. ideal new users).


















I know this may seem as a troll, while the beta is going on and the community is building up, but I'm sincerely wondering how relevant is a site such as Arduino SE (same question applies to the https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/Raspberry Pi Q&A site). The SE network has begun with Q&A sites oriented by "concerns" not by technologies: SO is all about programing problems, SU is about computer/application usage problems, SF is about system/networking problems. 

Then you got a Q&A about apple iStuff questions, another about Unix questions (but no MS/Windows Q&A, though). And now, we've got a RPi Q&A and an Arduino Q&A community... So in my point of view the whole Knowledge Base aspect of SO is being diluated and redundant.

So let's get to my point, most of the questions I saw on the site could be moved elsewhere:


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/623/why-can-i-not-use-pointers-instead-of-array-with-progmemWhy can I not use pointers instead of array with PROGMEM is a perfect example of a http://stackoverflow.comSO question (and is actually a duplicate of that https://stackoverflow.com/a/1335836/1290438answer) ;
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/620/digital-io-pin-as-groundDigital IO pin as ground is a good example of a https://electronics.stackexchange.com/EE question
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/611/what-are-the-flash-array-flash-table-macros-in-this-codeWhat are the FLASH_ARRAY/FLASH_TABLE macros in this code?, SO again
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/615/how-can-i-sense-very-high-temperatures-with-arduinoHow can I sense very high temperatures with Arduino? is again a topic for https://electronics.stackexchange.com/EE SE
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/564/how-to-trigger-an-alarm-when-toilet-paper-is-lowHow to trigger an alarm when toilet paper is low? would be a good question for https://electronics.stackexchange.com/EE SE, or maybe it could be a good example of the need of a "DIY"/"hacking" Q&A community site. Somehow the "opposite" of the reverse engineering site.


In the end, when I get through the list of all the questions I see no questions that are really 100% pure arduino topics. The questions could have been asked either on stackoverflow, on electrical engineering, on programming, and if we were closing the beta, I'm pretty sure we could move 99% of the questions on the other existing sites...

Maybe the only Q&A community site that's missing is a general abstract "DIY/hacking" community that given a problematic suggests a hardware and software solution to solve it, giving the best options to solve this problem.

In the end, Arduino is a nice prototyping tool, but it's far from being the only one, and it's not good at doing everything. The ST, PIC or MSP boards have their strong points as well, and shouldn't be excluded by the name of the Q&A forum. The only way I'd consider an arduino Q&A site, would be to turn into an arduino-tag aggregator from the other existing sites.

Reading https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5/why-is-arduino-se-different-ee-se-reduxthis topic, makes me feel that SE/EE has a problem in the way it is working (when they downvote/offtopic arduino questions), where actually the tag system can be used for filtering out or favoriting the newbies/arduino questions. And I've been answering questions on SO about arduinos, and saw no real problems over there.

And the shopping questions gap should not be filled by a product-oriented site (because the problem stays with the ST, PIC or MSP prototyping boards which also have their own environment of shield-like/accessories), but with a "DIY/hacking" community that would actually fill the void between EE and SO, and be a good place for the "varied" audience a site such as this one here would get. And in the same time I fear that questions for embedded design will be made offtopic on SO or EE to be moved on other product sites, whereas questions about 100% alternative hardwares to arduino or RPi will still be offtopic on those sites, while not gathering a community big enough to build a product Q&A community.

And with new Arduino board like the Due, the Yun, or Intel's Galileo, the gap between Arduino and RPi/cubie/beaglebone boards is getting more and more blurry.

So, here am I asking your opinion: 


how relevant do you think is Arduino SE?
don't you think it'd be a better idea to create a "hacking/DIY/inventing" community to talk about ideas and suggest paths to build a solution to a problem and fill the gap that product-oriented sites like RPi and Arduino do?
how to deal with alternatives platforms, like MSP/STM/PIC for MCUs or Beaglebone/Cubieboard/Gooseberry/OlinuXino... boards?


In the end, I'm here to share my knowledge, and that's my main motivation in participating to whatever Q&A site, the hackerspaces ML I'm on, or even on IRC. But I strongly believe that a concern-oriented Q&A site is way better than a product-oriented Q&A site. If the arduino community want to build a support forum, they can make their own Q&A site like the https://together.jolla.com/questions/Jolla community did using AskBot.

That site seems to be rather popular/active.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not participating at all on RPi.SE, and I don't like the RPi for many educated reasons. But I'm a user of the beaglebone, the cubieboards and a few others which makes me "an expert" (I mean a guy who can answers lots of questions because it's my daily job), for which I still have to ask/answer questions on SO, SU/SE and EE. And now that the latest high end Arduinos are leaving the MCU world to the OMAP world, making them RPi-like boards.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5and the "paper roll" question is a good example of a bad XY-problem question. I have a problem, I want to solve it, it's hardware+software, so I ask on Arduino.SE. What if the best solution is using a RPi-like board? or another MCU platform..?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@zmo But if I own an Arduino board, then I am constrained to a platform.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it's not because I own a screw driver that I shall use it as a hammer!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I don't understand this splintering either. The original site, Stack Overflow, was specifically not split into a Java site, a .NET site, a Python site, a Scala site, a COBOL site, a [Forth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29) site, a PHP site, an SQL site, a jQuery site, a JavaScript site, an Android programming site, a C++ site, a Ruby site, a Perl site, a Flex site, etc., instead relying on tagging for some degree of separation (e.g. excluding the horrible PHP questions from view).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/13763/can-we-make-a-general-diy-siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5zmo: That's like saying that someone should be open to using a CNC machine instead of a drill press. **If one user wants to know how to do something with one platform, then they should do it with that platform if it's possible.** //cc @asheeshb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPenguin - often times an experienced operator of a milling machine is precisely the person to explain why trying that operation on a drill press is highly dangerous.  Problems are frequently general cross vendor technologies, and by in effect "hiding" questions here, lower quality answers tend to result.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chris I agree totally that if it's not possible to tell the OP that. For example, if they want to do a *true* AI bot with Arduino, then we should inform them that that's simply too much for a little AVR chip. However, if they want to do a simple web page with Arduino (which is very possible and fairly simple) and already own $100 worth of Arduino parts, there's no reason to make them use a RPib2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5anyway, I think we can correlate the spread of stack overflow topics on other Q&A forums having an effect on the lower quality of questions and answers everybody is witnessing on the main site.


















Area 51 provides a http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/58150/arduinosnapshot of site stats averaged over a two week period. How are our stats changing and progressing over time?



Moderators have aggregated analytics available to them via the mod tools. Such data is not available to users. The Area 51 page provides the data at the current time instant but does not show the trend over time. Are the numbers going up or down? By how much?

This post attempts to keep track of the data at different times, thereby providing a general idea of the site's growth. See similar efforts going on at other sites:

The point of this post is not to compare us to any other site, and nor to provide an analysis of the numbers (for now). It is too early to start analysing numbers.

ok, let's answer to your opinions and elaborate on my point:

@AnnonomusPerson: I can't disagree more with you when you say There are plenty of questions that wouldn't fit on any other site:


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/626/webserver-on-arduinoWebserver On Arduino Even though this question includes the keyword « Arduino » which makes it specific to that platform, it could be asked on a non existing Q&A about hardware and software hacking that would be a balance to the proposal of the "embedded dev" proposal ;
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/140/how-can-i-communicate-arduino-to-matlabHow can I communicate Ardunio to Matlab that question could have perfectly been asked on SO, even though it would have been closed by lack of reseach of the OP and because there are dupes:


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5003548/interfacing-arduino-with-matlab-for-image-processing/5004931https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5003548/interfacing-arduino-with-matlab-for-image-processing/5004931
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18795171/matlab-and-arduino-does-anyone-know-how-to-establish-a-connectionhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/18795171/matlab-and-arduino-does-anyone-know-how-to-establish-a-connection

https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/261/serial-data-showing-up-weirdSerial data showing up weird is not a real question, even though I do not deny it could be useful, I'm not sure the way it is being asked will actually help people looking for answers: this is https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/101992/xbee-transmitting-garbage-characters/102008#102008an example of "serial data showing up weird" question on another topic which shows how differently things can be asked ;
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/362/where-can-i-find-a-central-repository-of-all-available-arduino-librariesWhere can I find a central repository of all available Arduino libraries? is totally borderline imho, and even on arduino.SE I would tag that question as "too broad". And btw, there's the new library format being worked on that will lead into a pypi/apt-like registry for arduino libraries. This is being discussed and will be ultimately solved ;
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/233/are-there-any-good-and-maintained-libraries-for-using-ds2482-i2c-to-1-wire-bridgAre there any good and maintained libraries for using DS2482 I2C to 1-Wire bridge? well I would tag that as too broad/primarly opinion based… Because in the end the answer to the question is where the OP went: update other's code or write it yourself.
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/122/what-are-the-steps-involved-in-porting-an-arduino-libraryWhat are the steps involved in porting an Arduino library? it would be, imho, a borderline but acceptable question on SO ;
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/323/how-can-i-adapt-the-dallastemperature-library-to-accept-another-1-wire-classHow can I adapt the DallasTemperature library to accept another 1-Wire class? that one would be a perfect fit on SO, or maybe because it may need some datasheet reading, on the embedded developers Q&A site still in proposal ;
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-are-or-how-do-i-use-the-power-saving-options-of-the-arduino-to-extend-batWhat are (or how do I use) the power saving options of the Arduino to extend battery life? basically, this question is laziness of reading the datasheet where all that is well explained, though it could be asked on the non existing hardware and software hacking Q&A, or the embedded dev Q&A that is to come, or even on EE.SE.


it took me more than two minutes to get to the point, and yes, it can be fun to create an arduino Q&A, but I don't see the coherence of multiplying product sites on Stack Exchange, whereas we're not addressing all the concerns.

@AsheeshR, I hope that you will be able to build a community here, and maybe become the official Q&A of Arduino, I'm not trying to mine your project, guys… But I think that Arduino is just a trendy and nice brigde between hardware and software world.

But the Arduino stack is full of overhead and boilerplate, to make it nicer, but that in the end makes it difficult to move from the "funny hack" to something used more "seriously". There are other frameworks that are worth being included in the Q&A realm the same way you guys do for Arduino, and there are other platforms on which you can run the Arduino framework that are not 1:1 copycats of the Arduino.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5to value more my point about this forum, what to think about [that question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22251070/memory-segmentation-error-using-mpide-and-uno32-pragma-config?noredirect=1#comment33826841_22251070) which is talking about the PIC32 using the Arduino framework and pin compatible with arduino, but asking something about sleep modes which is not handled by the Arduino framework. It's not a good fit on EE or SO, but it's neither on Arduino.SE! It deserves the embedded dev forum proposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First of all, **calling our site a forum is insulting to many users across the whole *network* of *Q&A sites*.** That's like calling an espresso machine a drip coffee maker. :) Another note, there was a lot of decision making at SE whether to allow this or not. Last Arduino beta, it failed for a reason you're proposing. We would've gotten shut down way before this if there wasn't unique territory here. Of course, there's going to be overlap on other sites... EE and SO have some overlap. **That's inevitable.** A better question would be *how can we avoid overlap*. (Edited my answer a few times)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well, coming from a strong usenet background, where many *forums* are dign ancestors of SE's Q&As, I can't consider calling a Q&A site an insult. The web-only php-bb like "things" where an insult to the whole concept of communication! I'm not going to fight against a moving train, I think I made my point quite clear, and I don't think I'll be able to accept any answer, except if there's one answer that gets a lot more points than the others ;-) About the *how can we avoid overlap* I think the answer would be to keep on separating Q&As by concern and improve the tag filtering accross sites! :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey! I'm not the one who get's offended by that... although most people just like users using the technical term. Your point IMHO isn't clear. There is a ton of overlap between SO and EE. SO is getting to big: half of the Arduino questions are about circuits and they aren't closed or answered. They "fall between the couch cushions." There's still unique questions here that can't fall into any other site (including, but not limited to shopping questions). Also, SO isn't focused on programming *errors*, it's about coding in general.


















Some SE sites in beta have slightly customized favicons. They are motifs instead of letters, like for example https://poker.stackexchange.com/Poker and https://chess.stackexchange.com/Chess. I think 'AR' doesn't really relate to the site. Could it be changed to something like this?

Generic Infinity Symbol



or the Official Arduino http://arduino.cc/en/Trademark/CommunityLogo#.Uxsnsx-BVWMCommunity Logo 



or the official logo itself (This is trademarked by Arduino)


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could we get a more interesting favicon?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The minus is on the leftb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TheDoctor Thats in the official logo which is trademarked and, as best I understand trademark law, SE cant use it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I frequently confuse this proposal with the Arkansas.SE proposal. +∞b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We might want to add the outline of a board for our logo, but that may be too small. A LED?


















We've already looked at https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114/who-are-the-notable-bloggers-in-the-arduino-community-and-how-can-we-get-them-iWho are the notable bloggers in the Arduino community, and how can we get them involved?. One blog not mentioned was the http://blog.arduino.ccArduino Blog itself, which is a big influence in the community. If we could get a link on the blog, we could get a lot of traffic and new members  because the blog is read by many people. 

Do you know (or are) a blogger on the Arduino blog? Do you have a friend who knows the bloggers of the Arduino blog?

A mention on the Arduino blog would go a long way in taking this site forward.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does anyone know anybody on the Arduino Blog?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Zoe Romano](https://twitter.com/zoescope) seems to be the main author on the blog.


















You sure can! A new "infinity logo" should be showing up on computers near you soon.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When i first saw the new icon, i thought, Infinity SE??!!?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is it black?  Isn't everything Arduino blue?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AwesomeUser This is the meta site, where pretty much everything is grayscale. It's standard for favicons to be black here. On the main site, the logo is in fact blue (although that's actually because blue is the default color for Stack Exchange beta site logos).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why didn't I realize that.  I feel stupid now! :pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AwesomeUser Don't feel stupid! It's a perfectly reasonable thing to think if you're coming in with an Arduino mindset.


















Yes, I think they should be allowed if the code relies on some Arduino-specific stuff, such as function calls or something related to hardware behaviour etc. The reason is that those elements may not be familiar or useful to non-Arduino programmers, so the question/answers won't have much value on the generic code review site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. Code can utilise platform specific features, which is pretty much our scope, and may not be of interest to people outside of this domain.


















This is an observation based on https://reverseengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/q/20/189mine and https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/q/12/31203others' experiences across Stack Exchange.

We should vote positively as often as possible! Also, we should encourage others to do the same!

Every Stack Exchange site will eventually end up with a different "base level" of voting --- that is, the expected number of upvotes for a question of a given level of excellence. (This effect occurs because people see a good question, but already with a certain number of votes, and think "oh, I would have upvoted this, but it already has enough".)

It's easy for us to affect this "base level" by encouraging high levels of upvoting now. We're setting the standards, and this really will have an effect.

The rationale for wanting the base level to be high is:


It provides better positive feedback to good contributors. 
This generates more reputation in the system, allowing more users to contribute in more ways as they gain privileges across the site.
More reputation also means there is more rep to go around i.e. bounties. These are very good for the site in general, as bounties lead to the generation of even better content. 


However, this does not mean that you simply upvote everything you see. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Vote Early, Vote Often!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And an important 4th point is that it would help raise the chances of the beta to succeed, as the current number of site users with high reputation is still very low.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was just wondering about the same topic yesterday. Although generally (on other SE sites), I only vote for questions and answers that I find relevant and useful to ME, I decided to broaden my view and upvote what I judge relevant or useful to someone else.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfpoilpret - I went through the same thought process and ended up at the same conclusion. So, I think the broader interpretation is the correct one - upvote the questions and answers that are good quality and belong in your site. Then you are encouraging people to keep up the good work.


















We got a https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/145/37new favicon almost two days ago that looks like an infinity symbol. Unfortunately, this isn't showing up in a lot of places, including the dropdown:


  


chat (including the icon on the tab):


  


and pretty much everywhere on http://stackexchange.comhttp://stackexchange.com, e.g. http://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#newesthere.

This is 100% reproducible on Chrome, Firefox, and IE on two different computers, one of which hasn't even been to Arduino.SE before. I very highly doubt this is a caching problem.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New favicon doesn't show up in many placesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's probably just a caching issue. Try using a different browser and see if it's any different.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PeterR.Bloomfield That's what I thought at first, but no. Reproduced on Firefox, Chrome, and IE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would wait a bit longer if its a server caching issue. If it isn't fixed by then, I'll try to fix it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson It's not caching; see my edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, not caching.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TheGuy I said *server side*. IIRC there's a lot of caching on the server side.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Annon I didn't think server-side caching was possible...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TheGuy I meant like that it needs to be updated on multiple servers and they haven't all been updated yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson Nope, that wouldn't be the cause of this. Servers serving up different content would be fixed in ~15 minutes (can't find the source for this). It's not part of [the sprites file](http://cdn.sstatic.net/img/favicons-sprite16.png?v=2a2968ded8b1ccc425e160db793c03e1) so that's probably the reason... there may be other places it isn't used, too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most of this is just caching. Try doing a hard refresh on http://cdn.sstatic.net/arduino/img/icon-48.png and you'll see the new icon.

The sprite image does appear to be missing the new icon though: http://cdn.sstatic.net/img/favicons-sprite16.png?v=ca9619587f38f6088409bc18c44b605b


















Yesterday I have seen https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/221/what-can-i-do-if-i-run-out-of-flash-memory-or-sram/239#239one of my posts deleted by one moderator with one comment to justify deletion.

I don't deny the justification for deletion (my post was little more than a link to a very good reference URL).

HOWEVER, there was no prior notification or warning, hence I was given no chance to improve my post before deletion.

Since I could still access it, I did perform edits on this answer, but it looks definately deleted, is that correct?

Hence my question: should we accept that our moderators exercize censorship so easily, and without any prior warning?

Shouldn't there be rules of conduct for moderators regarding censorship? 

For example, I have seen a few answers with rather rude language being there for long before being edited, and I did not understand why moderators took so long to edit it (I had myself commented to the poster that he should edit his post, which he clearly did not care about). 

A problem I see with such beahvior is that, if moderators start getting too keen on easy-going censorship, then I doubt the site will be able to keep its participants for long.

Indeed, it is important to keep in mind that Stack Exchange sites are here for people to help each other, and this is "best effort", some people just don't have enough time to write lengthy answers with all details but feel they can still help with their "simple" answers.

But I will force myself to do it if this happens again.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The mods just delete the competing answers to get more rep.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Particularly with the kind of new site that this is, it's going to be necessary to accept that a lot of questions will best be answered with a link to offsite resources which are far more established as parts of the arduino world that this site is - specifically, resources that people should probably be reading *before* posting questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisStratton - One of the reasons why the main StackOverflow site is successful is because it is the best reference; because lots of users invested the time to write useful, informative, questions and answers that were substantively *better* than Google's top result. The best answers here would include (if license allows) or summarize the key parts of the off-site information.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`If you're ever unhappy with a mod's actions, feel free to ping us from the chatroom` @PeterR.Bloomfield - how do you even do that? I can see the chatroom, but I don't see how to address a question to moderators in that way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this how? You go into chat, choose your favourite moderator (heh) and then try to start a new chat room with that moderator?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NickGammon See the chat FAQ section on [Notifications](http://chat.stackexchange.com/faq#notifications). It's worth noting that the pings don't always work when someone hasn't been in the chatroom for quite some time (which unfortunately is often the case for me these days as I don't have as much time for moderator duties as I used to).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There was nothing there about `ping` in particular (except ty**ping**) but don't worry. Hopefully I won't have to use it. :)


















This whole situation from a moderator's perspective:

(I wasn't the one to delete this answer.)

Yes, it does seem like it might have been handled differently (i.e. turned into a comment). However, here are some basic reasons to justify that:


You can get the answer undeleted by either flagging (you have enough rep) or by creating a new answer.
You seem to be an active user across the network, with 6K rep on SO. It would seem like you should know that link-only answers aren't acceptable here.


Code of condut: It might also been an accident. I'll be the first to admit that moderators aren't perfect. Do we need a code of conduct? No. We have superiors that if we need to be removed, we can be removed. If you don't like one specific action, you can bring it up here (Why did this answer get deleted) or ask us on chat. A code seems too much work, and it can't be enforced. It'll have to be a "honesty policy" type of thing, because the mods can't legally release all of the data to enforce something like this.

Your edit did greatly improve the quality, so I undeleted it and removed the comment.




  For example, I have seen a few answers with rather rude language being there for long before being edited, and I did not understand why moderators took so long to edit it (I had myself commented to the poster that he should edit his post, which he clearly did not care about).


Why didn't you flag it? It seems like we take care of 99% of flags in the first hour and a half after they are flagged. We can't reread every post every time someone adds a comment. Also note: one of the incidents with swearing were when we didn't have mod yet and couldn't do anything about it. There were several cases of this.

If you want to flag and add a comment, go ahead, but with most cases like that so far they required moderator attention.

First off, let's look at your answer:

I think you should really read https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225370/your-answer-is-in-another-castle-when-is-an-answer-not-an-answerYour answer is in another castle: when is an answer not an answer?, written by Shog, one of the Community Managers for Stack Exchange. In this, he says:

Strip the markup, and this is what you're left with:

i think you should take The tutorial HERE! This will help you a lot

Is there even one tiny speck of information there? No. Even the
title of the page being linked to would have provided something to
go on, but that was entirely too much work.
So let me be clear: this sort of response is not an answer. If
you see this, flag it. Moderators, if you see it flagged, delete it.

Yes, your answer was a bit more than just a link, but not much more. The mod who saw this "answer" realized that, and deleted it and left you a comment. Sure, it could have been left undeleted and just had that comment... but is there really a difference? You just flag for undeletion whenever you've improved it. You see, we really can't have bad answers on the site, and might just be left around for days upon days, making the site look bad.

Hence my question: should we accept that our moderators exercize censorship so easily, and without any prior warning?
Shouldn't there be rules of conduct for moderators regarding censorship?

You have something fundamentally wrong in what you're thinking. Censorship and deletion are two different things. Censorship is when it's material that you think the world should know, but the people in charge think it's bad for the world to know that. Deletion on Stack Exchange is simply saying Oh, this is a bad answer or a bad question. If it gets improved, it can be undeleted. However, it's not a good enough post as of now.
Regarding rules for moderators - there are https://stackoverflow.com/legal/moderator-agreementsome rules that a mod has to follow. However, the main thing is just use your own judgment. If a mod mistakenly does something, either another mod will bring it up to them or you can flag it as other to bring it to their attention.

For example, I have seen a few answers with rather rude language being
there for long before being edited, and I did not understand why
moderators took so long to edit it (I had myself commented to the
poster that he should edit his post, which he clearly did not care
about).

Again, there's something different you could have done. You could have edited the offensive content out of the post. That's why there's an edit button at the bottom of every post. There's some things that the community can handle themselves, and editing is one of them. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/Moderators are supposed to be human exception handlers, not the person who does everything for their site. So, if you see something you can fix, fix it! If you can't fix it, and you need a moderator to do something, flag it for their attention.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I never denied the fact could have had some more content, but I felt this specific article was useful for everyone to know, and I could not just copy its content as that would be called plagiarism. I just complained about the "no prior warning". Regarding the second point, I am against censorship myself so I would not edit that specific part of the answer; I use edit only to improve answer contents (review typos, grammar, or add some more details). For me the best way as to let the poster know about it and let him fix his post himself, which seemed a better way, although it did not work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfp It isn't concidered plageism if you cite your source and you rephrase it.


















In the interest of openness, I would like to say that I had flagged the answer as NAA based on an accepted policy for link only answers that holds across the network. I completely agree with the moderator action taken in this case and I do not think there was any overreach here. The problems on letting poor content stay up are far more severe, than the effort that may go into an early deletion and undeletion after improvement.

I flagged it after giving it 12-18 hours, which would have been sufficient time in my opinion to go back and write a proper post. In any case, you are a 6k user on Stack Overflow, so I expect that you would be aware that such answers are considered very low quality and are in general not-acceptable. A recent post by https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/200868Shog on MSO, reiterates the same.

Moreover, there is an answer draft feature available. Any answers that you are working get automatically saved by the SE editor every 45 seconds. If you intend to improve on an answer later, type a draft, work on it, and then post it when it has sufficient content to qualify as an answer.

I don't mean to be harsh, but there is no excuse for posting poor content, especially if it doesn't even live up to very basic quality standards. If you were extremely pressed for time, and yet wanted to help (as all of us do), then you could have posted your "answer" as a comment, and later come back and formed a proper answer, or let someone else develop an answer based on your findings. After all, the intention is to generate and share knowledge, and that would easily be served this way as well.

https://arduino.stackexchange.com/tourThe Arduino Stack Exchange Tour Page

There are a few fields that we can update and change in that page. Here are the things we can change:
1.)

Arduino Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for developers of open-source hardware and software that is compatible with Arduino. It's built and run by you as part of the Stack Exchange network of Q&A sites. With your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed answers to every question about arduino.

2.)

How to prevent unicorns from eating daisies

(We can change this to any question with 25+ votes: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/564/how-to-trigger-an-alarm-when-toilet-paper-is-lowThis one?) We only have one question available: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/40/what-are-the-other-ides-for-arduinoWhat are the other IDEs for Arduino?
3.)

Ask about...

Specific issues with arduino
Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered

Don't ask about...

Anything not directly related to arduino
Questions that are primarily opinion-based
Questions with too many possible answers or that would require an extremely long answer



There are a few other fields in different locations that I'll talk about later. However, I feel like we should personalize them, making us feel like "not the average beta." What should we change some of these fields to?
Submission Format:
## Update to #[1/2/3]:

Please put different fields in different answers. We can then vote on an individual idea, not a combination of them.
Note: Markup is only available on #1.

I know we all agreed that pure programming questions belong in StackOverflow. But I was a little sad today that we had to put on-hold this question, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/837/check-to-see-if-all-the-values-in-an-array-are-larger-than-x-and-set-them-to-zerCheck to see if all the values in an array are larger than x and set them to zero. Here's what the OP claimed to argue against closing/migrating his question:


  well , Im using it for and lcd connected to an arduino, but its ok u can deleate it I figured it out –


That made me rethink the issue. So I'm posting this new answer so you can also think about it.

In that particular case, the OP had a very simple programming question, that most of us here in Arduino.SE could have answered in less than 5 minutes. Granted, it was a pure programming question that, under current guidelines, should have been put on-hold and prepared for migration to SO. And one of the mods diligently have done so. As expected.

But my thinking is that everybody lost a little with this behaviour:


The OP didn't get his question answered. Instead, he was told his question doesn't belong here because of a guideline he doesn't even know about. For new users, it's common to interpret that as "you don't belong here", because he doesn't know all the context we are in.
The OP has an Arduino board and will have plenty more questions. But now he's confused as to whether his questions are welcome here. So, we probably lost an active user because of a rule that we forced ourselves to follow.
At least in this beta phase, we need the questions. It was an Arduino question, but we gave that up.


Rethinking the matter, to me the issue whether pure programming questions are on topic here is the same as an Arduino question that involves some electronics design posted on EE.SE. In that case, the question is on-topic on both sites, and it's up to the user to decide where to post it.

In summary, the new interpretation I'm proposing is that pure programming questions are on-topic here as long as they come from an Arduino context. These should not be migrated to SO. That's because everybody wins if it was posted here and we keep it here. We have the expertise to answer it, for sure, because they are likely to be about C++, the libs we are so familiar with, and other Arduino details that we are specialized at. 

By keeping the questions here, we save the OP the trouble and ansiety of having his or her questions migrated. And one day, as our site grows, we will be able to answer those questions better than SO.

What do you think?

In fact, I probably would have left the question open if it had actually mentioned that it was for an Arduino project. What we want to avoid is giving people free-reign to use this site as a beginner's version of SO. As a side note, it's worth mentioning that the OP had already posted the question on SO, and someone had incorrectly advised him to ask here instead. It seems silly to keep the question in both places.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[See response here](http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/29/when-should-an-arduino-programming-question-be-moved-to-stack-overflow/37?noredirect=1#comment374_37). cc @PeterR.Bloomfieldb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for "everybody lost a little with this behaviour:"

Not really.

Is there a tag for each build number of Windows on Super User? No. That's because there are too many versions.


  Is there enough difference between IDEs to support an IDE version tag? Would it be useful or would it just get in the way?


There's a reason they call them "minor releases." They're... well minor. Most of the differences between versions deal with simple bug fixes, compatibility with new boards, and a few other libraries. IIRC the serial library was updated with Arduino 1.0, but I'm not sure. However, that was a major release (i.e. the first number was changed to signify a big change), so it had a few large changes. I'd imagine that nobody uses something below 1.0, it's kinda like asking should we put a Windows ME tag on Super User?


  I've only been playing with the Arduino for a relatively short time, and until recently, it's been very sporadic. I asked a question recently which got the response to try out the latest Arduino 1.5.x as I'm (still?) only using 1.0.5.


Overall, it's not really necessary. Comments work fine... even if the OP says that they have the newest version a common response might be:


  Double check that you have the latest version (maybe try the new x.xxx beta version?) and try reinstalling the IDE and any libraries you imported.


I don't feel it's necessary, if it's that important it can be in the body of the post or in the comments. One thing people forget a lot is the purpose of tags: to make finding related items easy. If we split them up, people will have to subscribe to fifteen different tags instead of one. I like the idea of having fairly specific tags, yet not too specific so it's that perfect balance that makes finding data easier.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't call 1.5 a "minor" release personally. For me a tag could make sense if the question is about a specific feature of version.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfpoilpret Yes, it was a bigger release, but still there's no need to add one hundred tags and make every user tag their question with their IDE version, even if it's not applicable. Plus, not many users know their IDE version off the top of their head. You're forgetting the purpose of tagging. It's to help find a topic quickly. **If I need to find all IDE questions, I don't want to have to enter fifteen tags in the search bar.** Comments, as they stand, work fine when we need clarification.


















While I cannot see the answers at present, in my experience of moderation over the past year, I have seen that sometimes people really don't know about Stack Exchange policies on self promotions. They are genuinely trying to answer the question, and an answer sometimes does happen to be an off-site resource being developed by the OP. As long as the post isn't blatant spam ("Buy handbags CHEAP HERE!!") and is an attempt to answer the question, the first response should be to comment and then delete with the not an answer flag. 

Also, note that the spam flag comes with many network wide restrictions on the user account, along with a -100 penalty, so it should not be used lightly and certainly not be used for something that could be considered a valid attempt to answer, albeit poorly written or sounding like an advertisement.

Yesterday I could briefly see one of these answers to my question, but couldn't retrieve it later on. I remembered the name of the site so I looked for it -I had no time to check it thoroughly though- and that seemed to be a valid attempt to answer my question. I would like to mention that "with great power comes great responsibilities" and moderators should maybe use this power sparingly and open a door for discussion first. In general, I think that "shoot first, talk after" behavior may be harmful to this beta and potentially turn newcomers away.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfpoilpret There was no other activity besides a comment, and **both answers were advertising her company... only disclosed in their *profile*** (not really read). 1 answer wasn't even a true answer to the question. There's also a policy about not doing all self-promotion. It seemed a little forced. I don't know of a place online where it *is* acceptable to just promote your product. Can Google place flyers on cars if they didn't know that it was illegal to do so in some areas? No, and the user has 18 SE accounts with 580+ rep on SO. She's not new.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Honestly, do you really think **ALL** SE users are aware of SE policies? I'd be surprised if this number could already reach 10%b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfp It's no new concept... It's actually illegal to put flyers on cars. Why could you put ads as answers online? Most users don't know because it's not applicable to them. And 35+% have fewer rep than her.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPerson My post questions whether the "ads" were really *ads*. If the ad was relevant, then it could easily be rephrased to look more like an answer and less like an ad. While we don't want bad content on the site, we also don't want to delete everything without giving a chance to the OP. And [biicode](https://www.biicode.com) seems to be a relevant answer to the repo question. If the answer was just a link to a blog listing a set of tools, then that could be deleted as a link-only answer. But, this was? a link directly to the tool itself, which is however lacking, a valid answer.


















What are the specific requirements for qualifying as "involving" Arduino?

There is a LOT of latitude there. 


What if a project just uses the optiboot bootloader?
What if a project is compiled using https://github.com/Robot-Will/StinoStino
What if a project is compiled using the https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/pull/123"Bare GCC" Stino option I implemented, which disables most of the default arduino interrupts, and requires that the programmer implements int main(){} themselves?
Note: You can still use the Serial libraries without the default interrupts via this option. Does that qualify?


I have lots of project that are basically what I describe above. Optiboot bootloader, compiled with Stino, the only "arduino" thing I really use is the Serial library, and then that's just for debugging purposes. I think I could probably reasonably argue this is within the bounds of the rules, and yet I don't think it's realistically eligible.


For that matter, what about editing the arduino source files? I could make a project that looks exactly like a simple arduino project, that does something completely different by modifying the template folders. That would satisfy the "use the main arduino libraries" requirement. You should probably clarify that the arduino files have to be stock.




Realistically, I can't really see this contest even really working without any hardware requirements. I think a much better contest would require the use of one of the actual arduino boards.

Also, most of the competition was thought of assuming *good faith* on the part of members of our community, which is why the submission criteria are quite flexible. If there is a *next* time, feel completely free to participate in the  organization and formulation of the rules regarding the event.


















Another question:

Does adding better pictures (by replacing the existing pictures) count as a "major" change? I'd like to take a better camera to work tomorrow and get better images of the boards in my post.

The images would be substantially the same, just with less blur and glare.

I think a blog could add some value to the site.

One thing off the top of my head is a question like this: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/955/basic-electronics-resources'Basic electronics' resources [on hold] as a blog post than Q&A.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could also be a place to present projects/libraries (something like the contest showcase but maybe more detailed)?


















I think it's a good idea. But how will it work? (Specially in terms of when this community grows) Maybe a system of posts proposals and a group of reviewers or something like that? Or are you thinking more about having a reduced set of commiteds writers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We will need at least 4-5 regular writers (who can function as reviewers), and keep the blog going at minimum 1 post/2 weeks. Plus, of course, anyone would be welcome to join in to submit ideas, posts, tools, projects, etc, that we may cover, or even submit full fledged articles that could be published as-is. All of this depends on whether there are enough users interested in contributing, in the first place :)


















No. Definitely later, but it's too early.

One post every 8/10 weeks if we have 4/5 people isn't so bad. With us three moderators, and maybe another user it's doable. I'd even be open to organizing and proofreading all of the content and uploading it as long as I have the content two days in advance. However, will people really read it? The Facebook page has only 7 likes. I know not everybody likes liking everything they see, however, it does seem like we won't get many readers per post. 

I'd estimate we might get 50 a month if we're lucky at this stage. I'd say that that seems too low. The point of the blog is to expand the community's scope beyond the actual site and generate regulars, but we still need to get a little more users to make something like this worthwhile. In the meantime, share links to our site, friends us on Facebook, or even tweet one of our questions. Try the approach that if someone asks an Arduino question online to ask it here and give them a link when it gets lots of high quality answers. They might join us and then promote us.

I may be total wrong, but not many of the smaller betas have blogs. We're the third smallest community on the site, and I think we need to grow a little more to add something like this to make this effort successful.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I get 100-200 pageviews per month on my blog and I post less than once a month plus I dont publicise it; so your 50 views estimate seems rather pessimistic. Plus, a fair part of what we are doing is an investment a few months down the line rather than for now. Any useful content out there, irrespective of numbers, is good for us and the community. While I agree views are important, that should not be the sole driving factor here. The sharing aspect that you point out, goes without saying.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We should be sharing irrespective of the blog or other initiatives. Also, [islam.se] got its blog roughly 6-7 months after launch. I agree that this is fairly early, and I had voiced the same opinion earlier. However, we are a rather active and enthusiastic community and I think that a blog *may just* work out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Asheesh True, it might work out with us being active. For the Islam thing, we're a *month and a half* not 6 months. I say wait a few weeks before starting something and try to get a little more users.* For views... I guess we should keep the focus more on Arduino than on the site to gain viewers. | *It seems like we shouldn't start out with a post tomorrow, but we can start now and figure out a system.

Arduino: Yes! You can!

It may be too short for some of the things, but for moto 2-3 words is perfect size. It is remmembered and pronounced easy. Plus if you start describing something to someone that isn't much into it already, you can lose his interest very fast. Generalized messages like that are more prone to engage a person to delve into the matter. Even if someone have sceptical opinion. 

For example: 


What, do you want to tell me, you can build a robot with it? 
 Yes! You can!
How about a plane or hellicopter?
 Yes! You can!
Hmm, how about to make my car or house talk?
 Yes! You can!
Sounds intriguing. I'll look into it... and thats my floor.


If we need to sell the site to more people, then we need to sell it. Not to desribe it.

The above example can be changed a little bit for questions about the site itself.


Can I ask there how to do a awesome X?
 Yes! You can!


It could be with different tone:

Arduino: For all of us!

Certanly at any case, it shouldn't be dry narrative.

EDIT:

I propose something like those or combination of them:

All things Arduino! Hardware! Software! People!
All things Arduino! Ideas! Hardware! Software!


or variation like that:

Everything Arduino! Hardware! Software! People!
Everything Arduino! Ideas! Hardware! Software!


I believe that it is descriptive enough, as it basically is summary of the site and still simple and short to be easy remembered and to stuck in the head of people. If we try to be specific, we always will omit something important or we will make it too long. Also on the picture linked by  Annonomus Person, most sites have description about one row, so I believe it will fit there nicely.

P.S. If you like it, or you agree with the general idea, please do post your own opinion or your own sugestions and/or variants. More people participating, the better.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A great idea: it encourages the user and it does imply a call to action. However, I disagree with this: *Certanly at any case, it shouldn't be dry narrative.* Yes, it shouldn't be dry, but **we need to describe who we are, too. It should be a little bit longer that can be cut down into different parts.** Also, it might be formed into the site switcher "snippet" ([image](http://i.imgur.com/Gf8kLBf.png)), and "Yes, you can!" doesn't fit at all. You should try to add something else to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, I aknowledge the shortcomings for something so short, to be description. But the core of my post was, that in this case it should be little bit (or more) like marketing, than pure engeneering. "Site about small form factor open-hardware board for easy development etc." - this kind of description simply will never work very well, if at all. No matter how short or long it is, or how acurate or not it is. This was what I meant by "dry narrative" But you really got me thinking about it now :) I will update my post with new suggestion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice edit: (this is a tedious process: I updated my answer four times already) but have a few suggestions: 1.) *Ideas!* We don't really supply/discuss ideas here, but I guess it *could* work... 2.) Would you really say "Arduino! Hardware! Software!" to a friend? I love your more modern approach, but it seems like we need a combination of yours and something like mine so we can make the more boring text (for things like the site-switcher) but use yours for advertising: a slice-n-dice is what most sites use.


















SE sites are supposed to be experts sites, hence even if someone has a specific question that may be useful only to him, this question is worth answering as any other question (this is my personal viewpoint).

Also, how can you be so sure that a given question would be interesting to just the OP and nobody else? No one ever knows.

I would also like to add that, given the current number of new questions created per day, the time has not come yet when we should wonder if we must limit this number further.

Since Arduino.SE beta is still far from the expected achievements, I would rather avoid too much censorship on questions or answers: we must attract people here, both people who have questions and those who can provide answers should not be turned away for some reason that may sound obscure to them (at least to newcomers).

Make no mistake: I don't say any question or answer can be left as is even though it may be not "good", but I just say that we should relax a little bit our expectations on questions and answers "quality", given that such "quality" assessment is really much subjective in general.

For me closing a question is like using an H bomb to try to cure a pandemia; there are many other ways to make a question (or answer by the way) better:


add comments to suggest changes to the OP (a lot of us are doing that already)
based on comments, directly edit the question if the OP did not do it yet (I do it sometimes)
downvote the question if its quality does not improve after several days
threaten the OP (in comments)
close the question


Please note that I find it pityful when I see comments where a moderator says "welcome" and then a couple of hours the same moderator requests to close the same question.

My conclusion is that this site needs a graduated response to poor quality.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*we must attract people here... [don't close things that aren't allowed on other sites]* I totally disagree. If we have to allow lower quality content to get new users, **then we're doing something wrong.** We won't graduate if we only get the expected numbers by allowing low quality content. That'll never happen. Sure, I don't think we should turn off as many users as possible, but now that I look at it more, it seems too broad and partially opinion based. Part of the [how to ask](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) is make it relevant to others.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You did not read my answer carefully, I said quality is subjective; my view of qualit for questions and answers is obviously lower than yours; it seems YOU are always **overreacting** to all questions and answers that may not be of topnotch quality. As a moderator, I think you should be more... moderate!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dully acknowledged; you're right. There are other tools that could be used. However, other members of the community agree with me. It got closed recently. Also, the community has powers to close/reopen at will, so we should use it.


















I've used SE for some time now, but only signed up when the Arduino section was established. In my opinion there is the official Arduino site which caters for the advice and recommendations type of question, and SE has built up it's reputation by being a straight forward Q&A site. Look at the 'Hot Network' questions down the right hand side of the screen, all precise questions and not a lot of latitude (embellishment maybe) with the answers they will receive. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So you're suggesting that we don't allow these questions? Where do you think we should draw the line You're right: we have built up a reputation for being straightforward, but that doesn't mean we can't do this in a straightforward way...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think questions where everybody who is signed up can give a different, yet valid, answer should be allowed. The questions need to be specific is perhaps what I'm trying to say. In the initial example, the questions are too vague. What I think is a good piece of hardware you may have had a nightmare with...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Honestly I find the arduino site poor in terms of recommendations; it looks more like a list of stuff you may use, with not much further explanations or experience. If you want deeped insight then you need to check the forum which is very big mess in general.


















So we have a Twitter account, http://twitter.com/StackArduino@StackArduino. However, it hasn't tweeted, has no profile picture, and isn't linked to anywhere. Why is this, and can the account be "activated"?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why isn't our Twitter account tweeting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are more upvotes on this question, than there are followers on the Twitter account :)


















Now it's /questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed.

Changes:


Edited question and renamed to https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-optimizationcode-optimization
Added synonyms: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-optimisationcode-optimisation → https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-optimizationcode-optimization


I've declined to do anything with the vague https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/optimizationoptimization tag. Since the question was edited, it's an orphaned tag. If there's another type of optimization that comes up (i.e. energy), we can change add synonyms for the different spellings.

The reason for that is if I would've added https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/optimisationoptimisation → https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-optimizationcode-optimization and https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/optimizationoptimization → https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-optimizationcode-optimization, any time a user adds either of those tags, it will, without warning, replace the tag to https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-optimizationcode-optimization. IMHO this is a major flaw in the system. It should warn the user.

A quick note: from searches, it seems like spelling it with a z is the most common way, but is still widely used. However, since SE is a US based company, we'll stick to US spelling. I know that Stack Exchange has users and countless countries, but it's simpler to stick to one version of English spelling, the one that's built into the engine/code base.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Adding a synonym for [tag:optimisation] --> [tag:optimization] shouldn't result in it being re-tagged as [tag:code-optimization]. It may suggest it as a possible existing tag, but it shouldn't automatically change it (unless there's a pretty serious bug...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peter Haha, oops editing it now. I meant [tag:code-optimization] for the second tag in the paragraph. See updated post.



















  For me it is reason enough to not look into the details of the question


I agree. It's the responsibility of the OP to give only as much information as necessary to explain the issue. This question is a little different than most that we see like this, but still full output may not be necessary. In this example, there are a lot of duplicate lines that can be removed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am especially concerned about the fact that the majority of the question content will disappear in little under a week, rendering it useless to others. If the expiration was unlimited or the content was available on a platform SE can control, then the issue would be entirely different.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think both issues are related: if the OP has made a minimal investigation, then he should be able to limit the amount of input to put into the question, thus he should not need pastebin.


















I would suggest we set up a policy regarding use of pastebin or equivalents:


comment to the OP requiring to reduce code/output size to a correct amount and edit his question accordingly (within some early deadline, e.g. 2 days)
[optional] if someone can help with the question then he could edit and paste back the necessary code into the question
if after the deadline, nothing has changed, request to close the question (with maybe an additional comment to clarify why)
after the pastebin code is not available anymore, delete the question (moderator)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How have the people at stackoverflow solved this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jippie - StackOverflow requires example code in the question itself; not at PasteBin, JSFiddle or some other site. There are programmatic checks and close reasons for questions which don't contain their own example.


















First of all, we as a community should guide our beginners. The past few weeks I've been wondering if a guide to formatting and asking good questions. The help center only goes so far. We should be able to post this whenever a new user doesn't follow these "standards."

One thing that we should teach is how to use coding conventions. White space helps out reading if done correctly. We should teach how to use the site formatting tools and enable syntax highlighting. We can help them along the way with most of this with edits. How this relates the the question is: we should add a section to it explaining to post code inside the question.

If a question that has too much code, we should add a close reason to the system for no prior effort for not locating the part of the code that isn't working. This close reason would apply to the question you mentioned. It is not acceptable to post one thousand lines of code and then expect us to fix it.

However, I do not believe we should delete these questions with lots of code. We should first move the code to the question, and only delete if it expires and we don't have code.  The OP could still debug the code and go through the process of reopening if they wanted to. Deleting will just scare away new users. We can create guides to help them, but we shouldn't scare them away, nor shoold they make us do all the work.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"One thing that we should teach is how to ..." I'm so happy that for once it is not myself who sounds like the grumpy old man ;o) I do think you have a good point though.


















We've been getting a lot of questions recently when users dump hundreds, or even thousands (yes, this has happened) of lines of code into their question without even narrowing it down. This is simply not acceptable. We have lives, too, and we can't always find the problem by skimming code.

Some things that they could do:


Create many methods so everything flows and it's easy to read
Follow one coding convention throughout all of the code... this code is hard to read (not that it really does anything) because it has different styles:




void setup () {
one.function();  }
void loop ()    {
delay ( 500 ) ;
digitalWrite (5, HIGH); 
}


Although this one is minor, it seems only helpful to possible answers to stick to one coding convention. Also, if no convention is followed, it sometimes shows that the OP copied a bunch of code and mixed it up, and when it didn't work, they copied it to our site. Don't get me wrong, not all of these questions are this way, and I'm not saying if they followed a coding convention that it would be a good question. Unless I'm wrong, it's usually expected to show prior knowledge of what you've tried, and not doing anything doesn't follow that practice. We're a site targeted at newer users, and I can see these questions becoming common. I may be overreacting, but I just am genuinely concerned about the quality of some of these questions.


With many methods, they could send data to the serial window between each function that's called in main() printing out variables. Then, they could narrow it down to a few lines of code that mess everything up.


It's hard to explain this to a new user, but SE's expectation is to include in your post what you've tried. I don't want our site to turn into a wasteland of questions that're unanswered. Even 200 or 100 lines of code IMHO is too much... even if it's a 40 line sketch it would help a lot to narrow it down to five or ten lines. If a user can't narrow it down to a portion of their code, then they are probably talking a too big of project.

So what can we do about this? I've been thinking that we could add this to the help center somewhere, or create another meta post tagged /questions/tagged/faqfaq, and show new users it. We could add a few examples to that post explaining how to narrow down a problem.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can we encourage new users to narrow down their problem? Could we improve the help center to fix this problem?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lets not force a specific set of coding conventions on people. I personally follow BSD style, and would not like to be asked/told to use a different style philosophy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Asheesh I wasn't saying we should enforce a specific coding convention. I (although I didn't emphasize this as well as I though) meant that people change coding conventions in one sketch. An accident is an accident, but really, four different styles? It seems sometimes like they copied code, edited a bit, and when it didn't work they dump 300 lines into their question and ask "how to fix this code." I may be being too critical, but as far as I know you're supposed to show prior research on SE, and many of these questions just *don't*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally I'd like to see comments on people their scripts. That way we'd get an idea of what it should do right at that moment and we can see if someone misunderstand a command.


















If you search for arduino in SO, you'll see there are tons of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/arduino?sort=newest&pageSize=15new questions in there. Should we flag them to be moved to Arduino SE?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tons of new arduino questions in SOb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Be careful with the migration - unless something is highly specific to unique aspects of Arduino or too indistinct to survive there, there are a lot more experienced embedded engineer eyeballs on SO than there are ever likely to be here, so moving questions can easily lead to fewer and lower quality answers.


















One question that has paticuarly caught my eye is https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1493/using-multiple-laptop-battery-packs-to-power-everythingUsing multiple laptop battery packs to power everything. It seems more like about batteries than Arduino. The OP doesn't even mention if he's using an Arduino, just that he's building a robot and his question was rejected on EE.

Although the OP never mentioned it is using Arduino, he probably is to post it here. Still, why would it be acceptable to make it on topic by saying it's for an Arduino project? On SO you can't ask about an Excel spreadsheet if you say "it's my budget for buying hardware so I can code." 

This is not to decide the future of that post, it is to make a clear policy of when an electronics question should be closed. This is an essential part of our scope and I feel like we need to get this clarified before moving on to more important issues. What should we do?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When should we close electronics questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It can be a tough call - in the course of writing an answer for http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1490/calculating-location-with-4-piezos I was very tempted to flag it as unrelated to arduino.  But ultimately, I realized that the ATmega A/D would be a serious limitation - so in a way it does.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For that specific question, the OP mentioned he asked on EE first but it was deemed off-topic there 5I really wonder why by the way). You're wrong when you say the OP does not mention Arduino, he did it in his very first sentence where he mentioned he's building a robot with multiple Arduinos.


















Some people treat Arduino as the hobby/amateur electronics SE so anything that wouldn't belong in EE but mentions Arduino goes here.

We need to make a decision:

Accept the fact that not every question is appropriate in one SE or another. There will be questions that do not belong anywhere. Questions like this would be closed as off-topic because they have almost nothing to do with Arduino.

OR

Let this community be amateur electronics where we help with all aspects of projects that involve Arduino.

I'm in favor of the first option. I think we, as mods, need to draft a "What topics can I ask about?" post and let the community make suggestions on changing it.

Also, for option number one, where would the voltage regulator question stand? Off topic? I kinda like this rule of thumb: "If you don't need to know anything about Arduino, then it's off topic." However, that might be a little too tight of a scope...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, we have to limit the scope while ensuring we aren't restricting it too much.


















TL;DR everything is going to continue as normal.




  So what's next?


Nothing special.


  Is the Beta going to be extended (how is that decided and by whom?)


Yes. Sites may stay in beta for 2-3 years before any decisions may be taken. The Community Team reviews every beta site every 2-3 months, and looks for any problems or issues. If there aren't any ominous posts from the CM team, that usually means the site is doing fine, and is progressing towards a graduation.


  What will happen if the Beta is not extended?


This will be a long time away, if at all it gets to that.


  If the Beta is extended, how can we improve Arduino.SE achievements to meet SE expectations?


The statistics are not absolute criteria. A site may be kept in beta, even if it meets all the criteria; a site may be launched even if it meets 3/5 of the criteria. The numbers are there just to guide the community on some generic goals. The CM team knows and understands that each site is different, and they look for continuous stable growth, rather a set 3-4 parameters. The graduation process is very fuzzy. 

However, sites should try to stay in the green on atleast 3 to 4 of the 5 parameters shown on A51.

Is there some location on A51 (or elsewhere) where I could find out more about this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfpoilpret There are a few posts by [Robert](http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/users/48/robert-cartaino) around many other metas. You will have to search around to find more. I will link back if I come across anything recent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfpoilpret I've been watching these parameters for a while now and it looks like things are picking up now. Visits a day is steadily growing - it just went over 500 from `Needs Work` to `Okay`. Great new! Right on!!


















No one really can nuke https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wireswires. There is a system background process that is ran daily that cleans up tags without any questions.


Tag it https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wire-librarywire-library so you can get it past the system (and it's much less ambiguous)


As far as what to do to prevent this from happening, I did this this:


Synonymize https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wireswires ← https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wiringwiring, because someone wouldn't type "wiring" when referring to the library. The system will automatically rename everything tagged "wiring" to "wires."


This way, if someone types wires or wiring, they will get wiring. If they type wire, it will have an option for "wire-library" and "wiring." This will fix the problem.

We should leave https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wirewire alone. It's way to ambiguous to be synonymized to one of the two types of wire.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have tagged the question [tag:wire-library] and have edited the tag to provide some useful information.


















Okay, here's the problem: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming is really vague. I'd think it would be much more beneficial to use either https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++/https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cc/etc. Additionally, do you think we should keep the sketch tag, as it seems to be very similar to programming (with an exception of sketch size, which is its own tag)? However, there still might be some applications that would be appropriate to use sketch...

Take a look at some of the tagging I've seen that use https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming:


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++, (other tags)
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/javajava, (other tags)
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming, (other tags)


The programming tag seems very ambiguous. In some cases, you have to assume which language they're using.

So the solution that I feel appropriate:


Edit the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sketchsketch wiki to say something like this:


  For questions about coding your Arduino, please use the language tag (https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++ is the official language for Arduino). Use this tag when talking about the concept of a sketch, such as the actual file, not the code.

https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming: retag all non-c++ questions, perform a merge (i.e. automatic mass retagging), and edit the wiki like this:


  For questions about coding your Arduino, please use the language tag (https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++ is the official language for Arduino). Use this tag when talking about Arduino coding in general.


With the merge, we might have to move a question or two back to programming, but that shouldn't be a big deal.


So what is your input on this? Any suggestions? Is it fine as is?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we nukify the "programming"/"sketch" tag(s)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Closely related question: http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/111/when-should-we-use-the-c-tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Peter Yes, I did look at that one before I posted this one. The tag seemed fine then, but it seems like now that it's used pretty much whenever it's not electronics. IMHO tags are designed to be specific enough that someone can subscribe to a tag and get a small range of questions that they're interested in, but not too specific that they have to subscribe to twelve different RSS feeds for hardware interrupts. I think that separating topics like C++ and [insert another language] make the feeds more useful, especially since I'm not that interested in coding with Java.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One problem I see is some people may program with Arduino IDE without even knowing they use C or C++. Also, for beginners, the difference between C and C++ is not always obvious.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jfpoilpret Yes, that is a good point. I kinda feel like we should rename the "programming" tag and use that for standard IDE code (i.e. `setup()`/`loop()`).


















Here is the way it makes the most sense for me:

https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming should be for questions that require a knowledge of Arduino-specific methods and other code, like delay(19), TCNT2, and void setup(){}. It might need to be renamed to https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-codearduino-code or something similar.

https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%2b%2bc++ should be for questions that


involve pure C++ code, e.g.

#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
}

involve advanced C++ coding techniques that a mediocre Arduino programmer is not expected to know, (e.g. pointers), or
can be answered by someone who knows C++, but has absolutely no experience with Arduino code, e.g.


  Whai dosnt dis codez werk?

void setup() {
    digitalWrite(2, HIGH)
}




Other language tags, like https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/matlabmatlab and https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rr, should be used in any question that is related to those languages.

I kinda think we should rename programming to make it clear it's for standard IDE code... ideas?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPenguin Is that necessarily bad? If I want to see all coding-related questions, I don't want to favorite [programming], [matlab], [r], [c], [c++], etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5True, but I think we should add another just tag for the code with the standard Arduino bootloader and libraries. That way someone who wants only standard Arduino code questions can favorite that tag and someone who wants all code can favorite just one tag.


















The Electronics Stack Exchange has a built-in button to a free version of Circuit lab. It's not a bad little tool for creating simple circuit diagrams. I don't see a way to do that in the Arduino Stack exchange, at least not directly. I had to cheat, create a throw-away question in the EE Stack exchange, export it to a picture, then post THAT, which is quite convoluted.

If not, could Stack Exchange add that feature to the Arduino boards? It would be very useful and appropriate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you use Circuit lab in the Arduino forumb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a duplicate... Personally I don't think the SE team will do anything until we graduate out of beta or show a real need for this. I'm not quite sure if we will get this or not... :/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can start a question or answer in EE.SE, then draw the circuit, then copy the text insert to arduino.se, without saving the EE.SE question. Disadvantage is that you can't save the circuit. I am quite disappointed that Arduino.SE doesn't get a C/lab module (or similar.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is the Arduino SE in beta, and what does it take to graduate? And given that the Arduino is a hardware development platform, it seems obvious that circuit diagrams are a necessary tool.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPenguin, the thread you linked is not really a duplicate. It was a question on "How do I create circuit diagrams on the Arduino SE." My question was specific to wanting Circuit Lab. I marked it as a feature request, and I think it has merit as such.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DuncanC the other question is *also* a feature request. I'll still poke someone higher up though, if that would make you feel better. However, since we're still in beta, they usually don't grant us features like that unless we show an extreme need for those tools. We're in beta because, to add new SE sites, it goes through *Area 51* where users can post and vote for new proposals. When it meets certain requirements, they use a template and launch the beta site. There really isn't a *real* set of requirements as it is determined on a case-by-case basis: SE wants the site to not fail.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnnonomusPenguin In the discussion at the time I wrote my question, I was strongly adviced not to pick a specific solution (called Circuitlab) but make it a generic request for a circuit editor.


















This comment from one of the best contributors to EE.SE sums up the attitude of some:


  When are the ardweenies finally going to learn they don't belong here until they are ready to learn about the underlying electronics!?


Fair enough. It is often frustrating to answer questions from absolute beginners. I think most beginners now start with Arduino, and actually half of Arduino.SE questions could be accurately characterised as beginner EE.SE questions. So that is where Arduino.SE is different: it is forgiving of beginner questions.

Which brings me to another point of difference. If Arduino.SE is a starting point of many beginners then I don't think we should be too strict with what is and isn't on topic. For example, questions about programming a computer to interface with an Arduino over serial should be welcome.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is that the EESE folks now use the existence of this site as an excuse to dump beginner questions which even tangentially mention Arudino - regardless of the fact that the questions are entirely about "understanding electronics" and not at all about Arduino.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisStratton yea I've seen that a bit there. I would love to see Arduino.SE expanded to include all kinds of systems like Launchpad, beagle bone, etc. I don't know what it would be called.. "Hobby electronics" isn't right because so many engineers now use these. For example, the undergrad students in my lab and IEEE student branch use Arduinos and other similar devices to make some pretty complicated stuff. Perhaps "macro-electronics'? What do you reckon?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We already have a site which covers all of these topics in a sound technical manner - it is called EESE.  It's merely desperately in need of a change in local management to bring it back inline with the stack exchange mission.  The system isn't designed to support duplication, so the problem isn't the lack of duplication but that one site has been allowed to veer so far off-mission.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5EE.SE has a few (and I emphasize 'few') vocal curmudgeons who, while being competent to extremely competent in their specialties, can be intolerant to outright rude if someone rubs them the wrong way. I even had a moderator get his fur up when I pointed that out that there was a (small but noticeable) degree of contentiousness in the group. I'd like to see A.SE not mirror that aspect and kick questions that were kicked to us, back to them. There's no point in starting or aiding a p**sing contest and if - as I'm reading here - [continued...]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5... A.SE is trying to attract members, we'll need to keep our boundaries just a little softer and welcome folks who may well become solid contributors if they can just find a home.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem with soft boundaries is that the mission then becomes inherently at odds with the structure of the SE system.  It's not designed to support distinct "serious" and "beginner" sites for the same topics.


















I posted a question to the EE stack Exchange on how to put a horizontal bar above a character. 

The https://electronics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3878/how-do-you-make-a-complement-symbolanswer I got was to use MathJax, which I had never heard of. The markup in that post works perfectly in the EE SE, but not in the Arduino SE.

Can we get something like that for this forum? We're always posting about digital pins, and frequently need to interface with chips like ADCs, flip-flops, and clocked logic chips that have inverted pins like (not)enable, (not)busy, or (not)q (where all of those things should have a bar over them.

Seems like a facility for math markup would be a boon on this Arduino board.

I have noticed that there are a lot of questions that are like "How can I make my Arduino send data to my R program?" "How can I make my Arduino send data to my C++ program?" "How can I make my Arduino send data to my Processing program?" "How can I make my Arduino send data to my Matlab program?"

Because the Arduino part of the question is almost always the same (How can I make my Arduino send data to a computer), should we make a canonical "How to send data using serial?" question, and close others as off-topic?

Unfortunately we can't change that. All Stack Exchange sites use the same design during their beta phase. If/when we graduate to a full site, we'll get a custom design.

With that said, the difference between highlighted and non-highlighted seems reasonably clear to me. Perhaps you need to adjust some display settings on your system?

Alternatively, you could use a browser add-on which lets you write a script to modify the design automatically on-the-fly (e.g. GreaseMonkey).

https://robotics.stackexchange.com/Robotics 
Quite a number of Arduino related questions are already being asked there, so there is a lot of overlap in scope.

I am starting to wonder if we should close questions that are asking for tutorials.

These questions often lead to either link only answers or an extremely long answer. Should we close these questions?

If you need more than two pages or so to completely answer question, that's too long. Now, if it's a page or two *elaborating* on stuff, that's an entirely different matter.


















I've noticed quite a few questions of that style, where people are basically asking for links/resources. I think that kind of thing is outside the scope of the site, so it should be closed as Too Broad or Off Topic (whichever is most appropriate in the context).

(As a side note, perhaps we need an additional Off Topic reason to cope with such circumstances. Currently, the only Off Topic reason is "not about Arduino".)

The aim of pretty much any SE site is to become a resource in itself rather than a collection of links to other resources. Links may be included for background information or further reading, but they shouldn't form the primary content of any answer. We also shouldn't be posting long-form tutorials, as that doesn't fit the Q&A format well.

If an edit is possible, I will edit them to make them on topic, although some of these questions might be way too broad. I'm not touching the ones asking for a library (since I think we've pretty much decided that they are OK). If anyone wants to help, [these questions are the ones that aren't closed (and include the word "tutorial")](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=tutorial%20is%3aquestion%20closed%3ano).


















For those who don't know what a canonical question is, view http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/this blog post.

Anyway, can we brainstorm some ideas for ones? I feel like they could be a great addition to our community.

https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1233/should-we-make-a-canonical-how-to-send-data-using-serial-questionThis question already talks about a canonical question for sending data via serial

However, what other topics could we do? Does anyone want to write one? I feel like we need someone to get the ball rolling and then we can let others edit it (as a community wiki).

The nice part about this is one person could start it and then others can help build it. As it grows, we can start closing duplicates that are covered in the canonical question. In addition, chat can be used to distribute the work between people by collaborating effectively.

Some topics ideas:


Uploading errors
Web servers (how to control [] with an Arduino [])
...whatever else you can think of.


To do this, ask a fairly broad question (that, of course, can't be closed as too broad), answer it yourself, and (optional) flag for a moderator to make the question CW.

However, now is a good time to talk about the quality of our site. Even if we had 100K visits a day, we still would need to have good quality and a good core group to help moderate the site.

A friendly reminder built in: this is your site that you moderate. Please, feel free to welcome new users, edit poorly formatted questions and answers, and just vote. In addition, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privilegeslook at your privileges that you are granted (based on your reputation). You have more power than you probably realize, so don't be afraid to talk on meta or https://arduino.stackexchange.com/reviewreview items in the review queues. Recently, not many users have been stepping up to these tasks, so make sure to do so or our site will never graduate.

Now, it's your turn to say what you think could be improved? Is our tagging system outdated? Negative tone? Chat rooms should be improved? I want to hear what you have to say!

What we can take away from this:


We need to do a better job editing new posts to make higher quality (which might help some with SEO).
We need to answer more questions (hard to really improve).
We need to close questions efficiently. This is just more of a close a post when you see an off topic post kind-of-thing.

A good starting point would be for us to attend to the review queues, that are starting to pile up with review items.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ricardo yes they are, and I think skips are part of the issue. However, we should remind people about them definitely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Wake up atmel-328 with external interrupt.: Needs improvement.` - I had another look at that. I think the question is more-or-less unanswerable. There is no schematic, no code. The OP also mentions a "server" with no details about that. I'm going to close it as "too broad" - maybe the OP will clarify what it is all about.

Questions are being sent
EE -> Arduino and
Arduino -> EE 
without adequate reason
and even yesterday
EE ->Arduino -> EE.
At least it got back to EE which it should never have left 
BUT there are usually intelligent people who have a literally blind hatred for Arduinos  who go out of their way to make life hard for Arduino users and to abuse them and trash Arduinos generally. 

The intended ethos of the SE sites is not well enough understood. In one recent example (last few days) a user double posted on two SE pages and somebody voted to close on one page where they had adequate rep and stated the question should be closed on both as punishment for double posting. That MAY have been an EE - Engineering crossover but the same ill will exists between EE & Arduino.

Better promulgation of the Stack Exchange treatment and behaviour rules' is in order.

I think that our "answered percentage" is more than 72%, but we tend to use comments to answer some easy questions. This site is pretty useful and I learned a lot visiting it almost every day, but we should use more the answer box, correct me if I'm wrong.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. I often see answers shortly posted as comments to the question, without providing further explanation. It is important that people try to answer and provide some more details about the roots of the problem instead of just mentioning "do that, it will work".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps some people post brief answers in comments because they don't feel it's up to the quality of a "real" answer, don't have time to discuss it in more detail, and yet don't want to leave things completely unanswered. I think it's fair, if you can expand on such an explanation, to create an answer based on that comment. If you have only a little to add, mark the answer "community wiki" so you don't appear to be unfairly taking credit for a small contribution and perhaps others will add more to it.


















The "Featured" tab only appears if there are featured questions to show. Currently, I don't think we have any active bounties, which is why the tab isn't there.

Also, as far as I know, the tab appears on the main home page and under "Questions". It doesn't appear in the "Unanswered questions" section.

Today I first bumped into a question about the Intel Edison, and just now one about the Raspberry Pi. Apparently the word "Arduino" doesn't make it clear that this is about, erm, Arduino.
How can we make this more clear (if possible), and keep questions about other platforms out?

(I flagged both questions for migration to http://electronics.stackexchange.comhttp://electronics.stackexchange.com)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can we make it even more clear that this is a site for Arduino?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All SE sites have blatantly off topic questions from users who think they're on topic... I think most new people perceive the scope a lot more loosely than it actually is--myself included. The hard questions to steer people away from are the questions that have an Arduino element but are off topic (like programming a display app on a computer that communicates with an Arduino).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By the way, isn't there a SE site for Pi question and shouldn't any such questions be migrated to that?


















We've had similar issues with people asking Android questions in the past. I'm not sure there's much we can do to stop people from making that mistake. Part of the confusion might come from the fact that all Stack Exchange sites have exactly the same design during beta.

As a side note, the Intel Edison isn't necessarily off-topic here. It's http://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/Productsofficially certified as an Arduino-compatible product. Obviously it depends on the context of the individual question though, as it can certainly be used in non-Arduino ways too.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "officially certified" is of course a bad joke. Their own Arduino is so poorly documented that it wouldn't pass any certification at all. And have you read the 4 requirements for certification? There's nothing about compatibility.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just flagged  as off-topic. As far as I can see the Intel Edison is just leveraging (pfft, is that a word?) off the Arduino name. It - at best - seems to be "compatible with the Arduino IDE".


















An answer doesn't have to be concrete, but it should be at least a "lightly packed gravel" answer. As for your question, you're walking on the line. If you put a ton of research into your question, figure out most of the parts of the design, and ask a well-written question about the parts you cannot figure out, it's probably not going to be closed. However, if you just add two sentences to the body, it's a lot more likely to be closed. The point is, we cannot tell if your question is too broad without seeing it.

What do I do then? Let's break it down. First, figure out your design objectives. You're never going to achieve the fastest, so figure out how fast is good enough. How much can you spend? How big will this be? Will it have any cargo or other sensors?

Then, let's look at a bit more specific stuff:


Chassis: Steel? Plastic? Wood? Candy canes? Look at your tools and resources and pick that out. This is essential in how much this will weigh
Sensor System: Do you have the budget for an array of sensors so you can build better algorithms? How will you mount them? How fast can you sample them?
Motors: How will you drive them? How will you power them? Servo, stepper, or brushed? Closed or open loop feedback?
Board: How many things do you need to attach? Power usage constraints? How will you communicate with it? Do you need an ARM board?


You get the point. If you didn't specify enough information, I could tell you to try one of http://rockettestgroup.org/meeting/37/DM3%20Static%20Test.jpgthese if you don't specify, and I doubt that you want to attach something explosive to your Arduino! :)

The thing is, design questions are really hard to answer and they take a long time to get answered. If you put the time into your question, people will be a lot more willing to answer and you're a lot less likely to get your question closed. Furthermore, you get more specific answers that're more useful to you and you get a sense of pride when you realize that you designed most of this without any help. Just remember: we're here to help you along the way, not do everything for you.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"We're here to help you along the way, not do everything for you."
That's what I was looking for indeed. And it's true, it should be that way, asking "How to make such a system" is way to broad and people should indeed do some research themselves or atleast write down what they already know.

But Stack Exchange isn't really for "discussing"?
Or well the World Building SE has some very broad questions, of which no answer is correct, but sometimes one is the most 'probable/plausible'.
However you're right on that you would need more details if you're actually going to start the project.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FuaZe the thing that separates us and Software Recs or us and WB is that, although their answers are nowhere near concrete, it's still possible to answer it in a few paragraphs. Your question would require a lot of research and a really long answer to answer the question fully. Tastefully subjective questions are actually encouraged because they make interesting questions. So: your question would be OK as long as you focused in on a single issue (or a few related issues) that could be easily answerable.


















I fear that as the very nature of Arduino is that of the beginner - that's why it was created, after all - that an increased integration with either SO, EE, or both could sink the ship completely.

There are people asking question on ArduinoBeta everyday who have no clue about programming or electronics whatsoever. Even the basics, despite there being so many tutorials knocking around on the internet. Thus, they don't know that a simple edit or rewording is going to get them a better result from one of the full-blown sites.

ArduinoBeta needs to be nutured by a careful and patient few, at least for now. I get a little annoyed by the migration of questions from SO/EE to here just because it has an Arduino tag, especially a question that has been well laid out and is worthy of somebody's time to answer it. That will only stop as ArduinoBeta grows and sheds its Beta skin.

I stumbled across ArduinoBeta - don't remember how - and was surprised by how quiet it was. It hasn't taken long to spot some regular contributors who are no doubt like you or I; specialists in something, adventurers in something else and a downright liability in others, but if the masses from SO or EE start flooding in then the potential over-complication of answers may begin, through nobody's fault. Eventually the Askers will stop coming back, and never bloom into contributors.

Perhaps let's just let the stumblers stumble. I think a rapid addition of some https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1245/can-we-get-some-canonical-questions-goingcanonical questions may serve to up the general level, but then there will still be the task of teaching newbies how to use this site.

Additional:

I don't really like to name names but https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4512/olin-lathropthis user is precisely the reason we need to protect ArduinoSE from grumpy outsiders. His scathing comments in response to https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/75317/atmega32u4-vs-atmega328this question, about AT328 vs AT32u4 with regard to the Arduino community are damaging and vindictive towards anybody that would dare utter the word 'Arduino' in EE.SE . He is a respected member of SE and I don't question his knowledge or expertise one bit, but if he can't accept an new ethos in a particular field he's that makes him a bad engineer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I cannot see how to reconcile the essence of SE communities - that of users that come back and have a long-term improvement trajectory around a common interest, gathering badges and rep - with the idea of "perpetual novices". The more one uses ArduinoSE, the less beginner she is, and thus less "fit" she is to be here. Perhaps I got it wrong, but I think this surmises the (sort of) discomfort I feel when I think about it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(well, it has already been said that Arduino is a gateway drug into darker realms of programming and electronics... :o)


















I've been browsing the unanswered questions, partly because http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/58150/arduinoArea 15 says:


  71% answered: Needs Work – 90% answered is a healthy beta, 80% answered needs some work.


However I've found some "unanswered" questions really were answered, for example: 


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/12127/crash-when-using-stdqueueCrash when using std::queue. That had a perfectly good answer by Edgar Bonet, however he did it as a comment, not an answer so it didn't count.
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/8857/what-could-cause-interrupts-from-mcp23017-suddenly-stop-workingWhat could cause interrupts from MCP23017 suddenly stop working? - the OP worked out the problem and acknowledged that in a comment, however the question went "unanswered".
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/10321/attiny85-programmer-with-arduino-error-yikes-invalid-device-signatureAttiny85 programmer with Arduino error Yikes! Invalid device signature - again, answered in the question comments, and acknowledged as such by the OP.
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/11863/after-putting-arduino-uno-into-dfu-mode-it-is-no-longer-recognised-by-pcAfter putting Arduino Uno into DFU mode, it is no longer recognised by PC - the OP is asked for clarification but doesn't respond so the question lapses.


It seems to me unfair that these questions go into the "29% unanswered" bundle when they really were answered, or the OP simply lost interest (probably got it answered somewhere else).

Does this seem right? Is there a way of fixing up these statistics in some way?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some of the "unanswered" questions don't really deserve that titleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Attiny85 programmer with Arduino error Yikes! Invalid device signature* - I don't think that one ever got answered as the OP was vague as to what worked and then went on to buy a proper programmer. Note I was commenting there.


















I've seen a few questions like https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13258/use-arduino-to-read-data-from-ibeaconthis one which seem so broad as to be meaningless.

My requirement is to read data from ibeacons near me using Arduino. Is it possible?

Well, most things are possible, with enough effort. Maybe not video editing on a Duemilanove, but you get the idea.
I voted to close that one because it was a virtual duplicate of https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13185/reading-ibeacon-data-using-hc-05-bluetooth-moduleanother post by the same fellow but in any case isn't this question a bit hard to answer?
I personally try to be helpful if I can, but questions like that seem to suggest that the OP has not done any research at all, and basically wants code written. In the second thread I linked he said:

My requirement is to read data transmitted from iBeacon, is it possible using HC-05 or I have to shift to HM-10?
Please help.

Am I being too harsh? Or do we need to encourage people to try a bit harder with their questions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is a question "is this possible" too broad?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The referenced question is crystal clear to anyone who knows the first thing about the technologies in question.  Those who don't understand it probably aren't in a position to write useful answers anyway.  Compatibility of radio modems is relatively binary - they either work together or they don't with little room between. The first referenced device (HC-05) is incompatible no matter what someone does, while the second (HM-10) contains one of the two most widely used chips for that purpose, meaning that it merely comes down to the question of what firmware has been loaded into that chip.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Well, most things are possible, with enough effort. Maybe not video editing on a Duemilanove..." Challenge accepted!


















In cases where there's already an answer in the comments (or edited into the original question by the OP), we could copy it into a https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/community-wikiCommunity Wiki answer, with an appropriate acknowledgement. That will show up as an answer, but will prevent reputation going to the wrong person.

In situations where a question can't be answered due to lack of information (and the OP hasn't responded for a long time), we can vote to close the question as "Unclear what you're asking".

These steps won't solve the problem entirely, but it might help a little. What's important is to get the community involved in Review tasks so that problems can be dealt-with quickly. The other moderators and I aren't really supposed to do that ourselves (we're only supposed to deal with exceptional cases). I see the review queues are getting rather long again though, so we may have to step in to help things move along.

Fundamentally, the way to get skilled and knowledgeable posters to answers Arduino questions is to discontinue this site and put those questions back where they belong and where - as you have observed - there are already pools of knowledgeable people to answer them.

Unfortunately, the existence of this site serves as an excuse for dumping questions from more appropriate settings such as Stack Overflow and Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange, even when the details of those questions are far, far more appropriate to the respective subject areas of those sites.  The test is simple - if a question would belong had it mentioned some other MCU or embedded evaluation platform, then fundamentally it still belongs even if it mentions an Arduino, and pretending otherwise is just uselessly fragmenting things.

Apart from oddities of the IDE and the like, there are few problems that are uniquely Arduino - rather, most issues that come up are classic ones encountered across the whole of embedded, programming, and electronics work.  Flush a question to the "Arduino backwater" and you can't get help from the person who solved the same problem on a PIC or ARM last week, nor can an answer contributed in the ATmega/Arduino context to an obscure site help someone solve the same problem on a different chip next week in the way it could if posted to the site that handles that topic for all other contexts.  

The solution is not to segregate the Arduino questions, but rather to push back against the bigots in certain communities, work with posters to improve the quality of questions asked in their natural and appropriate settings when the initial posts aren't complete enough to answer, and do our best to make sure that questions get useful, technically sound, and transferable answers.  A lot of questions here aren't even about Arduino at all - but rather about peripherals that could be used with any processor.

Hiding the Arduino stuff on this backwater of a site does none of the above - instead, it means that Arduino questions get few answers, often containing glaring technical errors, and it allows the bad behavior on other sites to continue unchallenged.

I have to agree, thanks for caring!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(by the way, the very "radio silence" on this question is already a bad smell...)


















Stack Overflow has this as one of their custom close reasons:


  This question was caused by a problem that can no longer be reproduced or a simple typographical error. While similar questions may be on-topic here, this one was resolved in a manner unlikely to help future readers. This can often be avoided by identifying and closely inspecting the shortest program necessary to reproduce the problem before posting.


I think that something like this would be helpful for our site. Do we want this close reason for Arduino SE? Should it be rewritten? What do you guys think?

One question that I would like to close with this proposed close reason is this question: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/11738/arduino-uno-code-ignores-variables-selectively/11788#11788Arduino UNO code ignores variables selectively (It'd also be helpful for using the wrong baud rate)

I saw a question about an hour ago, it looked reasonable. It was about passing an array of values to a function. I answered it, it took 10 or 15 minutes, including making up some example code.

Half an hour later I go to check on whether I made any typos, but couldn't find any history of the question at all! Not even in the "moderator tools" list of deleted questions (ie. "recently deleted").



It wasn't listed in my "all actions":

  const int num_;
  const int * values_;

  public:

  // constructor
  myClass (const int num, const int * values) : num_ (num), values_ (values) { } 

  // other stuff here

  // demo
  void printThem ();
};  // end of class myClass

void myClass::printThem ()
  {
  for (int i = 0; i < num_; i++)
    Serial.println (values_ [i]);  
  } // end of myClass::printThem

const int NUMBER_OF_VALUES = 6;
const int myValues [NUMBER_OF_VALUES] = { 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77 };

// make an instance of the class with the wanted values
myClass foo (NUMBER_OF_VALUES, myValues);

void setup ()
  {
  Serial.begin (115200);
  Serial.println ();

  foo.printThem ();
  }  // end of setup

void loop ()
  {

  }  // end of loop




So, did I dream it? Did I answer a question that came to me in a vision?

I couldn't find any trace of it, until I remembered the browser history:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgOLi.png

There it was! The question did exist. Clicking on that link in the browser history revealed the question:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/1K2yD.png



And my answer:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/TGrMD.png

Now I'm pretty pissed off. I've seen this sort of behaviour before on other sites, but I thought StackExchange was supposed to be a knowledge base of good questions and good answers. Not to get an answer and then delete the question and the answer.



So what's my question? 


Is this acceptable behaviour? 
How do you deal with people that ask a question, wait for you to answer it, and then delete the question?
Why is the answer not listed in "all actions"? I did an action. I answered a question. I expect that to be listed.
How can they even delete the answer as well? On the Arduino forum, if you delete your question the answer still stays there, and then a moderator tells the person not to do that again.




Moderators: Please undelete the question, undelete the answer, protect the question from further deletion, and have a word with the OP.

This is the sort of behavior I have come to expect from the average Arduino beginner but the sad thing is that the user who did this is rated in the "top 2%" of Arduino Stack Exchange users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have undeleted that question. I can't see a valid reason for deleting it.



















  Is this acceptable behaviour?


Yes and no. If there was a reason for deletion, it may be OK. However, there doesn't seem to be any reason the OP would delete. Otherwise, I'd say no. It's really dependent on the situation.


  How do you deal with people that ask a question, wait for you to answer it, and then delete the question?


Flag it for moderator attention.


  Why is the answer not listed in "all actions"? I did an action. I answered a question. I expect that to be listed.


Deleted posts aren't listed in that section.


  How can they even delete the answer as well? On the Arduino forum, if you delete your question the answer still stays there, and then a moderator tells the person not to do that again.


We're not the Arduino forum, so there's that.

The OP can delete a question if it has only one answer with no upvotes (in this case they could delete)



For now, I've undeleted the question/answer and left a comment to ensure that there isn't some lingering reason the OP wants the question deleted.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for that, however the fact that I had to hunt down the link in my browser history shows it would be easy to "get away with" asking a question, getting a good answer, and then deleting both the question and the answer. The rule that he can delete a question if it has only one answer with no upvotes lets him get away with this concept of treating StackExchange as a method of getting free, private consulting. I suggest there should be a time interval before he can do this - so other people can at least view the question/answer and perhaps upvote the answer.


















I think merging could be useful.

We've certainly found that there's lots of people with questions about Arduino. However, being Arduino-specific means we have rather awkward and unhelpful boundaries for what is considered "on topic". For example, newcomers to the field don't necessarily understand what constitutes Arduino stuff and what is just general electronics or embedded systems.

That being said, coming up with a sensible boundary for a new merged site will be tricky. The major issue is that a lot of this stuff could easily be covered by the Electronics SE. However, as we've seen, some EE regulars are often not newbie-friendly (and can be downright hostile against Arduino and the like).

A while back, I proposed a "Makers and Tinkerers" site on Area 51. The idea was that it would be something like EE but for hobbyists and occasional users (rather than professionals or serious enthusiasts). It didn't gain any interest though, so I didn't pursue it any further. Perhaps it's something we could try again?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We have similar problems on *Robotics*, but have both [custom close reasons](http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/a/190/37) and [copy pastable text](http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/a/177/37) to help mitigate the problems.


















This is a copy of https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1283/37my answer to https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1281/37Camil Staps' copy of this question over on Robotics



Although I am open to the idea, my current preference is against a mega-merge of Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Embedded and Robotics.

As I said in https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1280/37my answer to https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1279/37Embedded Systems StackExchange (suggesting merging Embedded and Robotics):


  Having had a look at the questions on the site and http://meta.embedded.stackexchange.com/a/72/186only been able to identify one, I don't think that any kind of merge would be appropriate, but we should certainly suggest (using http://meta.embedded.stackexchange.com/a/72/186that answer) that any questions which are on topic here be migrated here.


I think that part of the problem here is that people seem to think that there is something wrong with a site which is asking good questions, getting good answers and accumulating page views and users, but hasn't yet graduated.

In fact, there is nothing wrong with this situation, and Stack Exchange have finally woken up to the idea that some small, niche sites will never reach graduation criteria, but equally will never disappear, and that we need to handle this state of 'https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites#comment840165_257614perpetual beta' more gracefully.

See https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257614/138432Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites and https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/257652/138432Should we rename or remove the "beta" label?

As I mentioned in a comment on http://meta.embedded.stackexchange.com/a/73/186Andrew's answer to http://meta.embedded.stackexchange.com/questions/69Closing this [Embedded] site on Friday, August 14


  The problem is that merging four sites with four scopes and four communities risks destroying all four. In particular, a clash of cultures and alienation of existing users is a big risk. Ultimately any stack exchange site needs to stand on it's own and now that permanent beta is the rule rather than the exception, we have to accept that small workable vertical sites may well be better than broader based, artificial amalgams. In essence, a strong & growing community, even if it is small, is preferable to a weak diminishing one.


In the long term, I hope that perpetual beta sites will start to get https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/259143/138432some of the benefits of graduated sites, even if it isn't worth Stack Exchange spending time and development resources on a custom site design.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5By maintaining a seperate arduino community, what you create is essentialyl a debug/troubleshoot forum for arduino. There is no real definition of arduino besides their simplified peripheral library and the platforms its been ported to. 90% of the questions on this site have no inherent reason to use the arduino besides availability. By expanding the scope to allow for all embedded platforms it allows for the community to grow and solicit questions and answers across platforms


















Personally I would vote not to, on the following grounds:


On the figures quoted, the merged site would go from around 10 questions per day (here) to 30, however of those 30 only 10 would be relevant to people interested in Arduino. This effectively dilutes the number an Arduino-enthusiast could answer (percentage wise). There might be some cross-over (eg. from the Embedded Systems site) but I couldn't view it to check, because it was in closed beta.
I've found this site here (the Arduino one) quite friendly, and reasonably helpful to newbies. That is probably one of the reasons it needs to exist. The Arduino is https://www.arduino.cc/marketed as being intended for anyone making interactive projects. This is one of the reasons why I think a tolerance for beginners is important.
I've found some of the other StackExchange sites a little less friendly to newbies, with posts being closed within minutes of being made as off-topic, irrelevant, already answered, and so on.




Having said that, it looks like a merge between Embedded Systems and Robotics with this site would be the least disruptive, especially if the Robotics site normally talks about Arduinos.

I'm the least in favour of the Raspberry Pi being merged. It is a different processor, it uses a Unix operating system, and is generally quite different to an Arduino. Also, some of it is closed source, unlike the Arduino.



An alternative would be to simply suggest to the (relatively small number of) users at Embedded Systems that they find a new home here.

We're shutting down on Friday, but if you would like to have a look around at embedded.SE, you could drop me an email at info@camilstaps.nl and I can invite you to the private beta.



















  For one, your "percent answered" rate is among the lowest in the network ...


Would you be able to clarify how to fix this? I went through some old questions (as you https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1270/some-of-the-unanswered-questions-dont-really-deserve-that-titlenoted) and found:


Some of them are "impossible" to answer. For example, we ask "which Arduino?" and get no response.
Others were answered, but in comments.
Others were properly answered, but the OP did not accept the answer.




Can you explain what we can do to reduce the percentage unanswered, to get a fairer score?


For ones with outstanding queries, does "vote to close" or "flag for moderator attention" help? In other words, do closed questions count as unanswered ones?
I can of course copy and paste a "comment which answered the question" into an answer, at risk, of being accused of taking someone else's credit.
What do you do with questions which have a perfectly valid answer, which the OP doesn't bother to accept?




I have a feeling that if I sit here and "vote to close" 300 questions I'm going to be told to "stop doing that, it's annoying". Maybe not.

The thing is with these sort of questions (and I see this on the Arduino Forum as well) that people want their questions answered today - and they even spray the same question onto:


Arduino Forum
Adafruit Forum
EE StackExchange
StackOverflow
Arduino StackExchange
Personal messages to anyone who has a lot of posts 


Then when they get an answer somewhere they lose interest in all the other places they asked. Their job is done, they move on. Meanwhile we have an unanswered question because they didn't provide basic information.



Can you clarify exactly what makes a question show up in the "unanswered" list?

Obviously:


No answer (but not closed?)


However what about:


Answered but answer not accepted
Answered with upvotes but not accepted


Suppose I go and answer 50 questions with no current answer. Does that reduce the list by 50? Or do I have to hope the OP accepts the answer, and/or that two (or more?) other users vote up my answer?



(Added)


  I chatted with your mods for a bit, because I did suspect that your topic might naturally lean towards a lower answered percentage.


Yes, quite. Some of the questions are about some of the newer Arduinos, connected to some interfacing chip we may not have heard of, and from that to some new-fangled GPS gadget just released last week.

So the chances that some, at least, of the questions are hard to answer is high.

It's a bit different to (say) Cooking SE, where people are unlikely to say: "roast pork? - never heard of it!".


  ... advocated gaining reputation by improving on others' incomplete contributions ...


I've been going through some of the old questions, and as far as possible (which isn't all that far) converting what appear to be "accepted" answers (in the comments) into real answers. I've naturally given credit along the lines of "As so-and-so posted ...".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Answering your last question first, because it affects the others: the SE software considers a question "unanswered" if it has neither an accepted answer nor any upvoted answers. (There's actually a reminder of this definition in tiny print in the sidebar of the [main Unanswered page](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/unanswered) if you ever need to look it up again.) So, as long as a question has a decent answer posted, the community can get it out of "unanswered" status with a single vote, whether the original asker is super active or abandoned the site right after posting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Before I posted this progress report, I chatted with your mods for a bit, because I did suspect that your topic might naturally lean towards a lower answered percentage. They didn't disagree, and that's fine; as I mentioned, most of the other sites near the bottom of the pack are also graduates. (They're no secret; you can check them out at the [all sites list](http://stackexchange.com/sites#percentanswered).) So, no need to go on a closing spree (which would indeed be annoying). Voting more may do the trick, and is good practice anyways! And now for the other solution I alluded to...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Long ago, when Stack Overflow was just opening its doors, Joel Spolsky (one of the co-founders, and current head of the company) actually [advocated gaining reputation by improving on others' incomplete contributions](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/09/15.html). Of course the community quickly decided that was rude when done to "steal rep," but I don't see anything wrong with improving the unanswered percentage by reposting some comments as answers, if they are suitable standalone answers. Might help to give the commenters a chance to do it themselves first and/or use CW.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've responded to your comments in the main reply. Thanks for clarifying.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`the SE software considers a question "unanswered" if it has neither an accepted answer nor any upvoted answers` - what if I upvote my own answer? Is it answered then? I found an [unanswered question](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/8539/serial-communication-from-os-x-app-to-arduino-mega) pop up a moment ago. I thought my answer was reasonable, but it sits there with no upvotes, no acceptance, no comment even. Should I upvote it to put it out of its misery?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The system doesn't let users upvote their own answers. If it did, everyone would, both because it'd mean rep for free and because why would you post an answer if you didn't believe it was good? If there's a _consistent_ pattern of good answers not getting upvoted, then that is a serious problem with site culture that needs to be addressed.


















If there isn't enough information to answer the question then I think "Unclear what you're asking" is a suitable close reason.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed - though a more effective mechanism for disposing of questions which have been abandoned in this state for months could be useful.  As an aside, questions questionably migrated from other sites where they are also on topic sometimes get stuck in this state if the asker does not follow the involuntary relocation of their question here.


















After reading https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-septemberDesign-Independent Graduation is on for early September! I have another response. :)

I see from http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/58150/arduinoArea 51 that we are now getting 10 questions a day.

Thus the main issue for not graduating is:


  The primary reason is the lack of high-reputation users on the site. 


I gather from the link above that there is some talk about gradually raising privilege levels (or maybe just deferring the time it is done). Isn't this viable? I gather that, right now, the privilege levels are 20% of that of a full site.

And, of course, not many people have 20 k privilege (like, zero). However as time goes by, people who consistently ask or answer good questions will get increased privilege. It would seem reasonable to let us graduate, then bump up the privilege levels at (say) every 4 to 6 months, until they reach the levels of the fully graduated sites. 

eg. 20% / 40 % / 60 % / 80% / 100% of normal.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now you're getting into better-as-a-separate-meta-post territory, but this has been discussed before. (Don't have a link handy at the moment but if you're really interested I can dig for one later.) My first reaction to a "sliding scale" for privileges is that it would be horribly confusing to users, both in the sense that there would be poor consistency across sites, and that people would show up to a given site and have a privilege one day but not the next, and have it again the following day, then lose it again later on...


















I don't really like auto-fixups. There are times when they drive you insane. You may overlook borderline cases. For example:

" , " should be replaced with ", " because there are no cases where there should be a space before a comma

Maybe in some comma-delimited file:
1234,  , , 5678



Double and triple exclamation marks and question marks also could be auto-replaced.

How about:

I tried to upload code to my Mega, but found it wouldn't upload when I had "!!!" in it:
     Serial.println ("Furnace too hot!!!");




Names of boards like "Arduino UNO" should fix themselves automatically.

Posts like your question would become impossible because you wouldn't be able to express the words "Arduino UNO". For example, you may be wanting to explain that UNO is the wrong capitalization to someone.
For example, what if someone posts "How come you corrected my spelling to Uno when it has UNO printed on the board?".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Everything in the quote, link and code tags could be ignored. The replacing should be really specific. Like only capitalising Arduino, Arduino model name first letter. The filters can be made really safe and I am quite sure the amount of errors reduced would be greater than the amount of errors created.

A couple of days I flagged https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/15981/consulting-and-inserting-a-string-into-an-array-if-it-doesnt-exist-arduino-idea question  because it was an almost exact duplicate of https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/15988/consulting-and-inserting-a-string-into-an-array-if-it-doesnt-exist-arduino-ideanother - and my "vote to close" was not accepted because the "other" so-called duplicate had not received an up-vote. Since I couldn't vote to close it, I flagged it. I mean, this was a clear cross-post.

The post was clearly a copy-and-paste by the same guy, who had made two accounts with similar names. (He claimed he couldn't log into one of them).

The response to my flag was "declined - flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention". Well, I don't know how else to deal with a cross-post if the system doesn't let me "vote to close it".

Then the thread was in fact closed by a moderator:


  This question is an exact duplicate of:
  
  Consulting and inserting a string into an array if it doesn't exist (Arduino IDE) 


So why do I get the flag declined: "flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention" - when in fact the moderator did intervene?

Now when I go to flag other things I get this message about how my other flags were declined, and maybe I should rethink things before I do any more flagging.

  because the "other" so-called duplicate had not received an up-vote


It's not the question that needs an upvote, it needs an upvoted or accepted answer.

This isn't meant to need random upvotes to close a question, but rather to make sure they both have a real answer before closing (I presume it is to prevent similar questions being closed that may appear duplicates on first glance that are slightly different).


  The post was clearly a copy-and-paste by the same guy, who had made two accounts with similar names. (He claimed he couldn't log into one of them).


To be honest, I forgot about this (newer) rule when I declined your post. From some digging on SE meta, it seems as it would've allowed you to close it if it was the same account.

If it wasn't by the same author, the best route would've been to let it wait until one of them got an answer.


  Then the thread was in fact closed by a moderator:
  
  So why do I get the flag declined: "flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention" - when in fact the moderator did intervene?


This decline reason is for cases when a user who is not a moderator can do the action. That does not mean that, since the moderator already saw the instance, that they can't act upon it. It's designed as a nudge to say, "Hey! You don't need me to do that. Let someone else with rep who isn't a mod handle that instead."

I mean, answering one of them just rewards the cross-poster (whichever one you answer). `This decline reason is for cases when a user who is not a moderator can do the action.` - maybe I didn't read it properly, but as far as I could see I was powerless to do anything except flag for moderator intervention. And thus, neither could anyone else.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is not a resolution to the problem.

Now I'm not one to quibble over minor matters (I'm quite a laissez faire type of chap), but I recently made an edit to a https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/14782/im-looking-for-a-way-to-serially-communicate-with-a-multi-mesh-arduino-slave-netquestion, which I was surprised to see rejected, especially when I saw the alternative accepted edit.

The edit that I proposed was the following:


  https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZGu0.png


I saw that it was rejected by the community for reasons of a subsequent edit,


  https://i.stack.imgur.com/g7h5e.png


To which I thought "Fair enough, I must have missed something, my edit was not sufficient", and was going to leave it at that. However, curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to have a look at the replacement edit. 

Imagine my surprise when the edit was merely to substitute a period for a comma, making it even more grammatically incorrect, whilst ignoring the obvious typos.


  https://i.stack.imgur.com/skXuy.png


I understand that the OP has the overall say so when it comes to edits, but also there is the point of once you have posted something to SE, it also becomes a bit of a community effort to keep everything "spick and span".

Now I know that I am a bit of a stickler for grammar and capitalisation, and that may put people's backs up a bit, but am I missing something?

Admittedly, I did miss the spiting (in the last paragraph) which should probably be splitting but I don't think that was the real reason for rejection.

I saw the review queue blow out by about 20 extra items today. As I worked through the "new user's answer to an old question" I noticed that the posts themselves were quite old, for example:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpG4C.png

Notice that this "new user's answer" is 8 months old! This is a bit late, is it not, to: "Watch for hidden gems, non-answers, and spam". 

That should have been done in January!

This post on https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/17905/suggest-me-some-good-seller-for-arduino-unoSuggest me some good seller for Arduino UNO HAS to be a troll. Asked by a new user, responded by three people, all very low reputation. 

What's the best "flag" to set?

I was going to choose spam, but they're not selling anything, although the answers provided very well might. So I chose opinion based answers. 

I personally don't mind opinion based stuff, although it's not in line with StackExchange generally, the question (if asked via google) would yield hundreds of websites and ebay auctions to see the stuff...

Likewise for questions that don't show enough research, which is a pet peeve of mine, I would prefer a better mechanism than closing the question for low quality or lack of research. I'd much prefer the question be hidden from view and the author given 24 hours to rewrite/edit it to meet a better standard. 

I realise that last point is beyond the scope of here, but what IS the best action for questions that show a complete lack of research, knowledge or personal examples of what they've done to try and resolve it?

I have noticed that low rep responders will often step in to answer a poor question. I'm not sure of the sociological reason for this - maybe because: no one with a high rep would want to answer a low quality shopping question, and so the low reppers step in, or; because they are all beginners too and have recently had to go through the whole "which one should I buy" process, and so it is fresh in their minds and they are eager to share their new found knowledge. I felt a little like this when I first started.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is actually quite common to see someone set up two accounts - ask a question on one account then answer it, advertising a product, on the other account.  That way it gets around the immediate "this is spam" knee-jerk response.  It takes them a bit more work but the posts do tend to stay around longer. I have seen it many times before.


















I'm really new to Arduino, though not to SE. What I've found so far in my perambulations on the web is that there's still not a lot of expertise out there, or that this expertise is not being shared in the same way that, say, Bicycle knowledge or Mathematical knowledge is being shared.

This reflects in part what you are describing: lots of new questions, not a ton of answers, no one stepping up to moderate or lead the community. Could it be the relative newness of IoT in general? Or is there a component of intellectual property protection that goes hand-in-hand with the hardware/product development aspect of Arduino that is a cultural shift away from the Open Source philosophy that was so seminal to the success of the original SO?

I do hope this takes off. It's such a shame when good beta SEs close down - I've seen a fair share.

My understanding is that the whole Arduino ecosystem is based on open source.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Or is there a component of intellectual property protection that goes hand-in-hand with the hardware/product development aspect of Arduino that is a cultural shift away from the Open Source philosophy that was so seminal to the success of the original SO?` - are you referring to the internal Arduino problems? Even if so, this hardly impacts on this site. Most people in the Arduino community are happy to share their knowledge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, not at all. I'm referring to the fact that many IoT projects have aspirations to go on and get productized. While the code side of things might be very open, I was wondering aloud if the productization side of things might account for a certain reluctance to help others get ahead. It was just a theory and certainly doesn't reflect my own attitude.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am presuming IoT is *Internet of Things*. I think it is in the nature of Arduino and microprocessors in general that people have such a wide range of ideas (many very interesting) that there is not necessarily a direction they can be "led" in. As for moderation (I am a moderator on the Arduino Forum) we try to keep discussions polite, and posts on-topic. After that is done, quite a few points of views are aired, and we all learn something. I certainly have.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you also have to consider that Arduino itself is an amalgamation of two different communities, software developers and hardware developers; and unless you were around in the 70's early 80's there hasn't been much crossover in the last 20 years.  Many of the questions that I see are, "I want to do XYZ with hardware 123", and most of the time there's not a good answer because no one has written a decent hardware library for 123, or if they have it includes only the most rudimentary functionality, that is difficult to expand upon without more driver development knowledge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Without having certain hardware or using it, it's quite hard to answer many questions. For example I have encountered so many weird things with the NRF24L01+ modules, I can help with it (I also somewhat help to maintain the related libraries), but with GSM and other less common things it gets harder. Certain hardware would possibly need better tag info so that people could read more about the hardware.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Those are some awesome perspectives - if I could downvote my own post I would, based on these insights. I definitely agree that it probably is more closely linked to the huge diversity - both in terms of skillsets and platforms, than any selfish desire to keep information close to the chest. Thanks for commenting!


















Can I ask questions related to Blynk in Arduino?

Blynk is an App that allows comunication between A Phone,Tablet and etc. with Arduinos and etc. Using USB or Internet (Ethernet Shield, Wifi Module and so on).

Simply put, if they can't be answered, they should've been closed already. Too broad is applicable if they don't have enough information in their question to narrow it down to a specific solution (you end up getting a lot of very scattered answers).

So, close questions if they can't be answered. They'll get deleted after some time automatically.

Hi everyone,

You may have noticed that I've not been active on the site for quite some time now. Life has kept me very busy, between getting married, moving house, looking for a new job, and moving house again!

Long story short, I felt it was only right that I step down as moderator, allowing someone else to take my place. I'll still pop in on occasion though, and hopefully I'll be able to contribute more regularly again at some point in the future.

In the meantime, I wish you all the best.

Regards,

As I mentioned in the https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2310/beta-progress-update-january-2016Jan 2016 beta progress report, one of your moderators asked me about stepping down a little while ago because things were getting busier in his life outside of Arduino SE. Actually, I oversimplified a bit there; two mods are leaving the team this week. I'm happy to announce that two other users have stepped up to replace them as new pro tem mods, though:

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please welcome your new pro tem mods!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Greeting everyone. Thanks for the honour of assisting with moderation of this site. And thanks to Peter Bloomfield and Sachleen for their work in moderating up till now.

I would say some caution is required. Just because the OP has vanished, it does not mean that the question is redundant/useless. I Just remember what I heard from a lecturer back at college, many moons ago: 


  If you have a question, but are too scared to ask it, for fear of looking the fool, then fear not. If you have thought of that question, then it is very likely that someone else has either already thought of it, and wants to ask it, or will do.


So, taking the example that you have just closed. The question may be a little unclear, due to the OP's possible poor command of the English language. It may, also, be unanswered, however, that does not mean that there is no answer in the post. In fact there are two comments, which offer short, and not in-depth, answers.

It is not the fault of the OP that the question does not have an actual answer as a posted answer. Many times one can see questions, with good answers posted as comments, for the shear quickness of getting an answer up there... The answerer may not be able to find the time to craft a perfectly worded answer, so just to get the OP on their way, the solution is posted as a comment. Often the writer of a very good comment is asked to turn that in to a answer, so that it may be accepted.

So, in short, closing a question that has answers in the comment, I feel, is a little short sighted, as someone else is probably thinking the same thing, and those comments could just give them the help that they require. I know that they have helped me in the past. 

Obviously, some questions are so awful that they deserve to be scrapped, however, in this cited case, I don't believe that it is. 

Also, these awful questions will generally get closed through the use of close votes. If no one has voted to close it, then it is probably not a good idea to take an executive decision to close it. Let the democracy vote the questions. As the docs say, a moderator generally has very little to do, until issues are raised. There is no need to go looking for work ;-) 

Instead of closing the question, why not turn the comments into answers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Someone could write about using two radios to listen to multiple channels at once but noone will do that (or at least has not yet done that) , plus it's always possible to get it reopened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When reviewing unanswered questions I have been attempting to turn comments into answers. Unfortunately, that means they are answers *with no up-votes* so the question is still technically unanswered. And I can't accept or up-vote my own answer (even if it is really someone else's copied and pasted).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NickGammon - I have *finally* fully understood your comment (better late than never), now that I have just read: "The Unanswered Questions tab shows questions that have no answers with a positive score nor an accepted answer. (That includes questions with no answers at all.)" from [Why does the “Unanswered Questions” tab show questions that have answers?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18870/why-does-the-unanswered-questions-tab-show-questions-that-have-answers). I had always assumed that an up-tick was required. Pᴀᴜʟsᴛᴇʀ2 just pointed it out to me in a chat on 3DPrinting.


















Many times questions get answered and answered well, but for whatever reason (lack of intelligence, age, language, understanding of how the site works, etc), an answer never gets accepted as the correct answer.

This seems to be a common problem on this site, mainly I think because of the clientèle that we have to deal with (blood from a stone springs to mind...) and that's making the whole site suffer IMHO.

So I am wondering if there is a way that we, as a community, could flag an answer as high quality (kind of the opposite of the low quality flag). With enough flags the answer can then be accepted by the community instead of by the OP (whom we never hear from ever again).

I'm thinking:


Can only be done on answers with > +(10?) votes
Can only be done if there is no accepted answer
Can only be done on questions older than (7?) days
Requires (5?) flags
You cannot flag your own post, but you can agree to your own post being flagged in the flag queue (so someone else has to have flagged it first)
You can only flag if you have enough rep (not my place to decide the level ;) )




Addendum:

Since the comments below have enlightened me to how the "not answered" is decided, another idea occurs to me - something that might possibly be implementable by the devs.

From time to time you come across a truly awesome answer that has no (or maybe one) vote. An answer that someone (* cough * nick * cough *) has obviously spent a lot of time and energy writing.  The kind of answer where you think "That's an answer and a half. It deserves more than just one vote".

I would gladly give up some of my own reputation to give that kind of answer 5 votes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions with good answers but none acceptedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As far as the addendum goes, you can sort of do this via bounties. The minimum spend is 50, and it doesn't actually impact the actual vote count. However I think awarded bounty is factored into how the answer is ranked on the page, and the rep goes straight to the user.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, bounty is more about "This question needs a good answer writing for it" as opposed to "This answer is stunning and is under-voted. I love it more than chocolate."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Except, you can award a bounty as a "you are awesome" gesture. I have seen it done on several occasions on other sites, I'm currently skimming through Meta to see if there are wait time requirements in these situations, or if you can just instantly award.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JakeC But not on an answer - only on a question. And it's not the questions that want more votes but the answers. It's not about giving Nick more rep, it's about getting the right answers to get enough votes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the kind remarks, Majenko, however I noticed practically all of your answers are lengthy and well-written as well. In fact when I come across an answer with lots of detail, diagrams, schematics, maths, etc. it is usually no surprise to find your name at the bottom of it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The frustrating thing is, I have an short answer on English Language SE about "crossing *the* road" or "crossing *a* road" which got me 21 up-votes. That's almost as much as my highest answer here, which took me hours to write. You seem to get heaps more rep on other sites, even for short answers, whereas long ones (including mine, Majenkos and others) are lucky to get a single vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: http://meta.arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1270/


















Interesting idea, but I thought things were worse than that. :)

I've noticed quite a few answers (including some of my own, heh) which do not get a single up-vote, let alone being accepted by the asker.

At least with an up-vote, the system (I think) considers the question answered (maybe with a couple of up-votes, I'm not sure). (Not accepted, but at least answered, so it drops off the "unanswered" list).

If people (like you and me) are not even up-voting each others' answers, I don't know where 5 positive flags are going to come from.

My suggestion at this point is, that those of us who post regularly take a look at answers (by others) and up-vote them if they look OK.

This will have the side-effect of boosting site reputation for everyone, so that more people can participate in voting to close doubtful questions, etc.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, this is a problem, and we're all (me especially) guilty of it :) I see you doing your part though, and I'm trying to do mine ;) I think a big part of the problem is that people come here having used the Arduino forum or other forums and expect it to be the same format - discussion - which it isn't. As a result they don't know about up-voting and accepting answers. Maybe we need a big-ass banner at the top of the screen "Don't forget to up-vote answers you agree with and accept the best answer for your questions."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've made a boilerplate: Was the answer helpful? If so, please [accept](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/accepted-answer) it by clicking on the "tick" icon next to the answer, and also possibly [upvote](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/why-vote) it. This indicates to other users that you found the answer useful, and it also stops Stack Exchange from periodically "bumping" your question in the hope of getting an accepted answer. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That is nicely written. Mind if I steal it? Maybe a boiler-plate commenting system would be good to have in the site - select from a list of pre-defined comments to leave people.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You are welcome to it. Having a bit of boilerplate makes you more likely to use it than just sigh and move on. I've got mine on my Leonardo boilerplate-generator. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice. I just installed QuickNote for Firefox - give me a notepad at the side of the browser window - great for copy-and-paste boilerplate :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course, I am using my own home-built keyboard (made from an old Amiga A500 and a suitable chipKIT board - who uses Arduino these days? ;) ) so I guess I could program it into there actually...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have a couple more, eg: Please *edit* your post and format the code using the code formatting markdown (four leading spaces). For help see [Markdown help](http://meta.stackexchange.com/editing-help). You should be able to do this by selecting the code and pressing `Ctrl+K` to have your browser do this for you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is currently where most of my participation lies. The amount of time I have to devote to answers is limited, but I still try and review questions that have unaccepted answers and ensure that the best answer has at least one vote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Much appreciated, it is, too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have added another idea that occurred to me to my question...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think upvoting is practical. There are right answers and brilliant answers. If both are upvoted, upvoting lost its value.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not suggesting upvoting all the answers. However if you find a question that has no answers with upvotes, then consider upvoting the best answer. If the OP disappears without accepting or voting, then it devolves to us to help others know which answer is a good one.


















I just want to echo what Nick Gammon has said and just explain my methodology for improving this. The system only considers a question as unanswered if it has no answers with a score greater than 0. There are a lot of questions out there with good answers, just none of them have been up-voted. So when I get a chance I go through and vote on answers that need

So my personal process for this is when I first open the site I scroll down through the Active list and look for questions bumped by the "Community" user. Per https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/48579these https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/184511answers on meta, these are exactly the questions that need attention, and one is bumped every hour. I spend a few minutes and look through the top few of them and vote where appropriate.

It's a thankless job, as there is no karma received for voting (although there are badges, I think), and it doesn't do much to address the general lack of engagement by the majority of the users here, but I does help the overall quality of the site in the long run.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is all good stuff. I have been using these sites for years, and even I didn't know how that side of things worked.  I now have a new task in a morning :)  It's just a shame I can't up-vote my own answers ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have added another idea that occurred to me to my question...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are no *direct* benefits from up-voting other answers (or questions) but the indirect effect is that the site benefits. For example, if a good answer has a few up-votes, then visitors are more likely to believe them, and thus the reputation of the site as a whole will improve in the wider community.


















This is a somewhat difficult spot. For a site like Mathematics SE, it's a no-brainer that MathJax support should be enabled, because nearly all posts use and benefit from it. Similarly, we'd never consider adding a chess game replayer to Ask Ubuntu; it just doesn't make sense.

Here, the distinction isn't so clear. It's obvious how circuit diagrams are related to the topic of Arduino, but the https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/38/list of posts that could benefit is pretty short as-is. And adding a package, even one that we already use on another site, isn't free; for example, see https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/252283/Nick Craver's (somewhat technical) explanation of testing MathJax on Stack Overflow. Granted, those are different dependencies on a different site, but the principle is the same.

The point of all this is, I haven't seen enough of a need for this tool demonstrated to justify enabling it. I realize the list is a bit old, and was probably forgotten about for a while, so I'm not formally declining the request just yet. If you're still interested in having a circuit diagrammer on Arduino, show me that it will benefit more than just a handful of posts!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see how MathJax is a no brainer for Mathmathics, but a decent circuit editor isn't to Arduino. The list of posts that benefit is far from complete. I think there would've been a lot more quality answers on this stack if those tools would've been available. A lot knowledgeable people are dismissed because of the lack of basic tools required for them to share their knowledge. Anyways I left this stack ages ago, I don't mind.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Because many questions here (based on a quick, non-scientific sampling) seemed to be purely about code or other issues that don't involve circuit design/layout at all when I was writing the answer. I might be sympathetic to arguments like "more questions would have included diagrams had the tool been available, and it was too much of a pain to include them any other way" but nobody's made such an argument or shown any evidence of that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**Hardware information isn't optional for embedded systems.** Without hardware information, many questions are left unanswerable. The four posts in [list of posts that could benefit ](http://meta.arduino.SE/a/38/) show various uneven ways that more experienced users have worked around the lack of schematic capture (and all four of those questions successfully *got answered*). That's not a list of *unanswered* questions that needed hardware information to become answerable. Wish I could come up with a good SEDE query for this...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unlike electronics.SE where about half of new questions are from experienced users, most Arduino.SE new questions are from "rep 1" users who mostly lack technical electronics background. On electronics.SE, new users are commonly prompted to "use CTRL+M to insert your schematic", but on Arduino.SE we're lucky if we eventually get a blurry cellphone photo of a breadboard, or a crummy fritzing build diagram. In some cases there's a reference to a specific "shield" make/model, and the hardware info must be searched offsite. **This leads directly to poor quality questions...**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag [tag:Arduino] is the single most popular tag on electronics.SE, but that community doesn't generally have the patience to interface with less experienced Arduino users or deal with the various quirks of the Arduino toolchain. Low quality Arduino questions frequently get migrated (dumped) into Arduino.SE, where the very tool needed to improve question quality is missing. Here there's a very small cadre of experienced users answering a wide range of posts from new users, and the lack of schematic editor hobbles the core users -- so the site struggles to graduate.


















The reply by Jake C is very interesting. Perhaps the user came here because of Google. I think a milder response is usually in order. Something along the lines of:


  So you want to make your ATtiny85 have a USB interface? I found quite a few pages about this when doing a search, such as https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.htmlthis one.


That is hinting that using Google may help (if the user hadn't already) but is not particularly condescending.

What does data-processing mean?

Although it's clear what https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/processingprocessing refers to -- and I agree with renaming that tag to clarify that it's about the processing language itself; tag https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/signal-processingsignal-processing and tag https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-processingtext-processing don't have any usage guidance. I'm leery of combining two already ill-defined groups of questions into another even less-well-defined group.

I took a look at the existing tagged questions, there's currently 25 questions tagged https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/signal-processing?sort=votes&pagesize=50signal-processing and 9 questions tagged https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-processing?sort=votes&pageSize=15text-processing.

I can guess that https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/signal-processingsignal-processing would include digital signal processing techniques (within the Arduino's capability), as well as analog filtering.

Browsing the 9 questions tagged https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-processing?sort=votes&pageSize=15text-processing, it's not clear to me what this tag actually means.


how an Arduino program(sketch) deals with strings of text input and output?
how the C pre-processor processes the text of the source code?
how the Arduino-specific language elements work?


Is https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/6660/program-got-so-many-errors-about-expected-or-before-eitherprogram-got-so-many-errors-about-expected-or-before-either really about text processing? Seems like this question turned out to be about why #define dw 8; should not have the semicolon.  Similarly https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/8470/arduino-program-got-error-expected-primary-expression-before-token-errorarduino-program-got-error-expected-primary-expression-before-token-error doesn't contain anything that looks to me like text processing. 

What about this question about https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/17774/any-way-to-use-f-macro-with-a-passed-variableF() FlashStringHelper -- that's useful and related to how constant string expressions are stored in an arduino program, but probably belongs in https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stringstring instead.

And for that matter, why isn't https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1013/how-do-i-split-an-incoming-stringHow do I split an incoming string in text-processing when https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/10557/how-to-get-string-parts-from-stringHow to get string parts from string is? I'd edit it myself if I was sure what belonged in that tag.

So since https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-processingtext-processing has only 9 questions, and 0 followers, and it's unclear how these questions are related, let's instead:


rename https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/processingprocessing to processing-lang as proposed by @Avamander
shore up https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/signal-processingsignal-processing with a clear tag wiki definition
dispatch the 9 questions in https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-processingtext-processing to wherever they really belong (maybe https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stringstring), then burninate https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-processingtext-processing.
add [text] as a synonym for https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stringstring


Re-tagging individual questions is a straightforward edit, but without a clear well-defined definition of what the tag is supposed to mean, it's harder to find related stuff.

I was looking at the achievements and I noticed that some might actually have a negative impact on the value of this SE website.


Vox Populi/Civic Duty (Use the maximum 40 votes in a day/ Vote 300 or more times)


May cause people to spam votes in order to get the achievement.


Cleanup (First rollback)


I'm not even sure on how to cause this, but I don't believe it's a good thing. Nor should we make people try to get a rollback (for the achievement) I believe.


Disciplined (Delete own post with score 3 or higher)


This is never a good thing?


Peer pressure (Delete own post with score -3 or lower)


This requires you to have a -3 post to begin with, so one could, purely for the achievement, attempt to get a -3 post?

It's all a bit theoretical but, the effect isn't easily spotted, so could be bigger than sensed.

(p.s. I found that all SE sites have these achievements, is this meta still the right spot to post this? Or should this be on general Stack Exchange meta?)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could some "Achievements" have negative impact?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a good question, however, I think this would be better suited on the general SE meta, as it is a SE wide query. I have flagged it for migration.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See [Which meta am I supposed to post on?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/89228/which-meta-am-i-supposed-to-post-on/) - it is fine to post here, and the SE team do read these posts. However if you (Paul) *want* me to I can migrate it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Peer pressure` - I haven't felt motivated to try to earn that badge. ;)


















I was going to make a comment as it was going to be a bit long.

This is more of a general SE meta topic seems all sites have these achievements available. 

Also badges don't equate to privileges which are earned by making meaningful contribution to each SE site.

So if there are people who want to go around sites asking stupid questions or spamming unimportant questions or answers just to earn a badge they will probably be the ones who have a low rep keeping them away from established user privileges.

There is also a good side to the achievements as it gives the incentive to other users to participate in the site and feel like they have been commended for that involvement. For example


  Vox Populi/Civic Duty (Use the maximum 40 votes in a day/ Vote 300 or more times)


This to me would make people want to show others that there are useful questions or answers on the site and cause that user to participate in site activities.

The one for giving someone a badge for a question with -3 votes I would think would be aimed at new users and others here and there so as to keep the site uncluttered from nonsense questions, thus another incentive to users or newbies to help keep the sites running smoothly.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that it's good when there will be more votes cast (I kinda have the feeling Arduino.SE has way less voting as on other SE's) but it shouldn't be because of an achievement. Your point of them not getting extra's, is very good though! You don't gain a lot, nor does the site loose a lot of value.
Which isn't for the: "Delete a 3+ question", when I saw it, I thought: "Hey, I could just delete one of my old questions.", which would be against the principle of StackExchange.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My initial thought was, that more badges would equal "a better image" of my account. Though, having good questions in your "history" might be better than that extra badge ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Paul the disciplined badge is quite odd, but only one person has it on Arduino.SE and 51 on EE.SE, and most are high rep users so they are not going to be spamming just to get badges. Stack exchange obviously saw the use of having such a badge, they have their view and many could have a different reason why that badge would be awarded.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nice! Actual stats! I was scared that it might be an unnoticed issue. But 1 one whole Arduino.SE is not very worrying. The badge is odd indeed. But does not seem to lead to worrying behaviour :)


















This is not a question (really), but recently I have seen a rash of 10-20 suggested edits, more or less each day, over the past few weeks or so, where the only change was to remove the "Thanks". Now, don't get me wrong, the "Thanks" shouldn't be there, there is a post on SE Meta about it, and I'll add the link if I have time to find it later. I, myself, have also just made edits where the removal of the "Thanks" was the only edit, but that is because the rest of the post was impeccable.
However, the "Thanks" was not, in 90% of these recent cases, the only thing wrong, and the images without description, spelling mistakes, bad grammar, poorly formatted lists and code formatting had been left as they were and were not corrected.
Initially I had clicked upon "Improve Edit", thus giving the previous editor the +2 rep. However, today I have been rejecting all of them, apart from one, as it just seems that lazy editing should not be rewarded.
I have some screen shots as example, but I do not wish to publicly name and shame, and so I will also not name the editor in question - it was the same person in each and every case.
So, I guess that there is a question after all... am I right, or just being a grumpy s*d?

I had paused the review of these edits for a moment or two, and by the time that I came back, I noticed that the remaining 4 or 5 had been approved anyway, again with just the "Thanks" having been removed, leaving behind glaring spelling, grammar and capitalisation mistakes, as well as one of the images not even displaying correctly (the markup was missing the preceeding "!" - note the text "TFT Front Image"). Here is a screenshot of the top of the post:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLML1.png
I do not want to sound like a nitpicker, but could we all try to be a bit more diligent in both edits and approvals, as awarding +2 points for lazy edits will only encourage more sloppy editing.
Addendum
I may be kidding myself here, but I like to think that if people see that their post has been fully edited, that they understand why, take those edits onboard and, hopefully, in their future posts, they then can craft a better, more stylistic (and hopefully easier to read) question or answer (without the "Thanks", typos, spelling mistakes, lack of capitalisation, omission of image descriptions, poor list formatting, question titles written in title case, lack of of code formatting (including the use of the <--language: C --> tag), bad grammar and what have you), or maybe, I have just been working in the field of documentation for too long...

Please be generous to people cleaning up. Really appreciated!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Avamander Don't understand how this new edit (8 mins ago) to this post helps?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChetanBhargava It is fairly common on SE to remove usernames from examples. It also avoids creating any negative association.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Avamander I got it, so the OP should have redacted the information in first place? Unfortunately OP is the one harping all about editing and missed the key about editing :-)


















I didn't respond when I first saw this because I wasn't (and still am not) sure. It appears there is nothing wrong with removing these "thanks!" lines, so don't worry about that part.

I asked other moderators, and it seems that all accepted edits award +2 rep, so a "simple" edit does not "steal" rep from a more complex edit.

I must admit there have been times when I edited egregious problems out, without checking for more subtle ones, for example:


Subject in all caps
"Arduino" misspelt as "Ardruino" or similar
Code not formatted
Rambling extra sentences like "hello", "thanks", "goodbye" and "it's urgent!"


However if you have time I think it helps to look more deeply and see if you can spot other things. For one thing, new posts by new users enter the review queue. If you just remove something simple like "Thanks" then that post leaves the review queue, and other problems might be missed. If you don't have time to check in more detail, perhaps postpone editing until you do have.



The bottom line is, the site looks better if we have good questions and good answers. Anything our more experienced users can do to help both of those causes will help improve the reputation of the site as a whole, thereby encouraging more people to visit it.

I have been getting this warning below:

Some of my previous edits were rejected by a biased user (or a "nitpicker" / "grumpy s*d" as proclaimed) that I wish not to name.

I have provided enough evidence and links on this meta site why the edits I did, were fair.

I think it is because we are "only" a Beta site. Once we graduate, I think more migrating options become available.

As a moderator, I can migrate to other sites, and have done in some cases. I usually ask their moderators first, and quite often they decline to accept them. However migration does happen.

I think there is some rule that Beta sites don't get to migrate to other sites. I'm not quite sure why such a rule exists (it would seem more logical for it to be the other way).

Sometimes users ask questions that basically shift the research and development work of a particular project or product into the hands of the community.

This problem is somewhat related to https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/203/how-can-we-encourage-new-users-to-narrow-down-their-problem-could-we-improve-thnot being specific enough, but bears another issue: acquiring free labour from the community without giving something in return.

It's a problem that isn't new, not even on StackExchange.
But I recognised it on Arduino SE too.

It goes without saying that SE is a platform where people get to ask questions.
Oftentimes without knowing in advance what is involved in finding an answer.
We all sometimes need a pointer to a solution or can make great use of someone else's experience.

But some questions have a certain smell that the poster would rather have others magically come up with a production-ready solution to their complex design ideas – and implement them too.

How should we deal with questions that basically just ask for free engineering work?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seeking help versus outsourcing labour for freeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 - There was one _blatant_ question that caught my eye recently, I forget if it was on SE Arduino, Pi or Robotics, that asked for some code to be written for the OP and then to be emailed to them (they provided an email address!). I flagged it and it has, fortunately, been removed. Another one, that comes to mind was a question that tried to get a software team together that could deliver a project. _That_ question went the way of the first... :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this an example of a "outsourcing labour for free" question? http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/22660/integrating-arduino-program-with-java


















You might have mentioned getting help with homework, and college assignments too. :)

On the face of it, this site is designed to answer specific questions, and when it is used like that, I see no problem if the question is being used by an engineer in some company, a high-school kid, or someone doing a thesis. Of course, this is in addition to hobbyists, and others who simply want to learn.

However overly-broad questions, like "I have an assignment to monitor heart rate - please provide the code for me ... oh, and a schematic" can simply be voted-to-close as too broad. This is asking for work to be done, not to have a question answered.

If there is doubt, asking for them to clarify what they have already tried can soon wiggle out people who are serious, from those trying to avoid work. For example:


What have you tried already? However see this: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/172758/what-have-you-tried-epidemic“What have you tried” epidemic. So don't post a comment "What you you tried?" on its own. It isn't helpful.
Where did you get stuck?
Please post your current code, even if it doesn't work
Please post your schematic
Please post links to your (proposed) hardware


We are not really supposed to answer shopping questions, or about which device is "best" to buy. These are too subjective.

Without being too snaky about it, we can also see what research they have already done. Sometimes I say "I see Google returns 100,000 results on a search for Arduino +yourIdea - in what way did those hits not help your project?".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I agree with this answer in general, it's the *too-broad* vs. *work-to-be-done* difference in particular that I'm contemplating about. A question asking for free labour really isn't necessarily too broad (and vive versa). Voting to close is a way to deal with the problem, but a rather subjective one as long as there aren't any tangible criteria. In the end I feel that the *too-broad* reason would be used inflationary – and the underlying issue still wouldn't be addressed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the simple answer is that we don't provide "free labour" - we answer questions. Thus "asking" for code to be written from scratch isn't a question that has a reasonable answer. However asking why a certain function doesn't turn on an LED is a reasonable question.


















Maybe this is not the right place to ask this kind of question (sorry i this is the case).

Anyway, the answer of Oded explain what I was asking. Thanks for you help.


















I usually add the C++ tag when I get the chance for one simple reason:

It activates syntax-colouring for the code.  

(assuming there is code posted)

It also activates syntax-colouring for any code in replies.

There is a way of doing that without the C++ tag, which is to paste this in your question or reply:

<!-- language-all: lang-C++ -->


Syntax colouring makes the code much more readable, and is useful to have when browsing someone's code in the question, and someone's code in the answer.

By the way, if you have done this and want to post something which is not code (like serial monitor output) you can also disable the colouring like this:

<!-- language-all: lang-none -->

If people did not abuse the C++ tag for every question that merely happens to contain some C++ code, the issue of this page would not exist, and the tag could properly be used for language questions.  As you point out, there is a correct way to do syntax highlighting - additionally syntax highlighting is hardly essential.  Last I checked the arduino IDE did not even support it :-;b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That was a while ago, right? It would make more sense if SE *automatically* switched on C++ syntax colouring in code in the Arduino section. Newbies won't know about the tag to turn on colouring (nor care, probably). And what other language would code be in?


















A bunch of those tags are not eligible for becoming tag badges yet - a tag must appear on a minimum of 100 questions to be considered for tag badges.

The tag badges you cannot track are those that are not eligible to tag badges.

I have recently posted about using a 2-Wire speaker with Arduino Esplora, however I couldn't tag it correctly because there was no arduino-esplora tag. The Esplora tag would be very useful in case anyone posts about an Arduino Esplora, and anyone looking to answer questions about the Arduino Esplora. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I believe that completes your question. You should accept @NickGammon's answer since it's also right (and the question is resolved).


















A tag should be created (from scratch) if you use it. It doesn't have to exist in advance.

I think that a question still "belongs" to the user even if it is migrated, as there is an over-arching Stack Exchange account, of which the accounts on individual sites are "children". Are you sure s/he didn't get any pings from your comments?

Maybe my update, has turned my question into a _non-question_, or in other words, has ended up answering itself. I am still not convinced though. I guess the only way to be sure, would be to ask K-Dawg, the OP of the original question, whether they received any notifications or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5At the risk of facing a harrasment law suit, these are [the comments](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35325751/static-sidebar-and-fluid-content-with-header-and-footer#comment60945675_35325751) that I have left for the user.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, very good. :)


















The Vox Populi badge is described as :"Use the maximum 40 votes in a day".
However I tried to get this one a couple of times now and I never got to more than 31 votes. Then I get the message "You have used all your votes for today".
It looks like a bug to me or there should be a requirement to have "XX question votes up/down votes" or a rep of ZZ to get to 40 votes?  

As to the "usefulness of the badge"
Well ... how useful are the badges anyway :-s.
I see a benefit in "appreciating other peoples effort" by upvoting answers and questions (and somehow in downvoting as well). After all this is a questions and answers site and not a discussion forum.  

For those willing to give it a try. It is quite some work to find 40 questions/answers worthy to upvote in a day.

Thanks for the clarification. With the current quality of questions this badge is not an option for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Downvotes count as part of the 40.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e540 Downvotes is not an option for me.


















I should warn you that if you up-vote too many answers in a day (particularly made by the one person) the system thinks you are vote-rigging and reverses the votes. I don't know the limit, but I suggest that you don't just find a single user you like and up-vote 40 of their answers. Or even two users.


  how useful are the badges anyway ...


I think they are just to encourage you to do things you might not otherwise bother with, like editing questions or answers to make them better.

I thin I'll just forget about stack exchange. We are not compatible.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No real harm done. I'm just back to where I started two days ago. As for the Vox Populi badge, it sounds like one of the harder ones to get because of all the voting rules. They are designed to stop voting abuse, but can be frustrating for genuine users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I spend a couple of days reading questions and answers to vote for good ones (not only your answers but based on author because it is easy and because some authors just give better answers).   
It seems that stackexchange does not appreciated my effort and reversed my work. So I'm not happy.


















https://arduino.stackexchange.com/review/reopen/15243This question is very vague, and they've provided a little more info, but really not enough. I'd like to encourage the user to get in and provide more info.
But if I click re-open, is my ONE re-open vote enough to re-open it? If i'm part of a concensus, then I'd gladly give it a go and if others thought so too then maybe he get's another shot. But on the face of it, it's not really there yet, and would only offer to re-open if others felt that "you know what, let's give the guy an extra chance."
I am new to this level and will "go with the flow". I DO WISH SE sites were more forgiving on vague questions as I know I've had my fare share over the years, but...
tldr;
What is the best course of action in this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok guys, I'm new to this level of review, how does re-open work?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5_That_ question, to which you refer, is actually really interesting, although badly worded and somewhat broad.


















No, it takes five close votes and five reopen votes to put a question on hold and reopen a question, respectability. If you think it should be reopened, then vote accordingly. If no one else agrees, no harm done. If others agree, your job is done.

If you're really not sure, it's best to skip it and leave the review to someone else.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5cool, I had no idea if it was 5 to reopen or not (I knew it needed 5 to close). I did skip it at any rate :)


















I'm not surprised the question was closed:


  hi guys How can I serial monitor repport send the atmega328 and save in chip? thanks. 


That's incredibly vague. In fact, it doesn't make sense.

OK, he edited it, but the damage was done. A lot of people didn't understand it, and voted to close it. Not one of them was a moderator, even. So it took 5 close votes to close it. Now he need to improve it enough to get 5 reopen votes.

You are, of course, welcome to cast one of those 5 votes.

These are the sort of questions I wish stack could help users with (well, not this vague, but) given the right push these questions  can pave the way to greater learning. Anyway, it's where it should be :) I didn't cast an open vote, not unless they were really going to try and have a go, but my question was more about the process. I didnt know about the 5 votes to reopen. Thanks again guysb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are trying to help, but we have to understand the question. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, it's all good. I understood that too. It was probably a very poorly chosen example on my part. It's a discussion I'd like to take elsewhere, but in essence, sometimes I do wish SE was more "how can I achieve this solution" as opposed to the strict Q&A style that it is. I know it's not. and I'm not debating the issue here and now. Cheers Nick! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Madivad - personally I agree with you. I have had a few questions closed as not being on topic, when all I was trying to do was get a solution to my problem. We are trying to not be too pedantic here (on Arduino SE) as we know we get a lot of beginners here.


















You have 30 votes per day. This is the limit.

And in addition to that, you get an extra 10 votes on questions. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/vote-for-this-question-or-the-kitten-gets-it/Read this blog post to find out why.


  You can vote 30 times per UTC day. You get an additional 10 votes on questions only.


I stumbled accross this little detail at the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-downdown votes privilege help page. So if you can only vote 31 times, try if you still can vote on questions.

It's already a work-in-progress. Stack Exchange is using a bot called SmokeDetector (affectionately known as Smokey) which goes through some fairly complex rules to detect spam. You can visit it here:

http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hqhttp://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq

It currently merely detects, and (if requested) sends a message to anyone who subscribes. Subscribed members can then flag the spam for moderator attention, or moderators can delete it immediately.

It does get things wrong from time to time, so that is why it doesn't automatically delete spam. For example, on the English Language part of SE recently, someone asked about expletives (eg. f--k) which were picked up by Smokey as as "offensive text detected in body of post". However in this case it was a legitimate post enquiring about whether certain expletives were appropriate in writing a novel.

Of course, there are other posts using words like that which are just for dating-site spam.

Training Smokey is an ongoing effort by a fairly dedicated team of coders. :)

Probably the closest you could get to automating things would be for a number of users, who are frequently logged on, to subscribe to the notifications. Then they could quickly flag as spam such posts.



As I write this, I got a couple of notifications from Smokey. One was an hour ago and one 55 minutes ago (I was eating dinner at the time). In that time the community had already flagged it, and it was automatically deleted due to the number of flags. So the current system works reasonably well.



Shortly afterwards I got a notification from Smokey. After only 22 seconds, a post had two downvotes. After 1 minute it had 4 downvotes. I had to hurry to delete it before the system got to it first. :)



IMPORTANT 

Don't downvote spam: flag it as spam - that activates the Stack Exchange automated system.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This certainly covers the "detection" part, but I'd still like to have a mechanism in place for obstructing submission. Maybe a "Are you sure?" page or two with the confirm button in different places using multiple submission techniques (to further hamper automated submission) would be useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Im sure you're aware of this, but I have to note that a spam flag carries an automatic downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It also must be noted that smokedetector is a community project run by members of the community - stackexchange itself currently has no hand in running it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The spammers are well aware of Bayesian filters by now, which is why a lot of spam contains complete nonsense, with a link to the spam in the middle. The nonsense (although looking like English) is supposed to give it a positive Bayesian score. Plus there are other techniques they can use which I won't list (I don't want to give them ideas!). These can be hard for automated systems to detect but easy for humans.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Maybe a "Are you sure?" page` - or a Captcha. However there are quite a few people (including me) that find Captcha's incredibly annoying. Plus they don't seem to slow spammers down all that much.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're not going to expect too many users with 102+ reputation to be spammers, so you could probably let them slide without presenting a captcha.


















Spam is a good thing and should be cherished :)

It means we are being noticed and deemed worthy of spamming.

The more spam we get the bigger and more important a site we must be.

I think the "come out of Beta" decision shouldn't be made on how many questions / answers you get, but on how much spam you attract ;)

(By the way: for those without my warped sense of humour, that's a joke :P )

Flag it and let a moderator take a peek. We have the tools to directly convert an answer to a comment (so that it looks like it was posted by the user who posted the answer) or delete the post altogether. We also have the know-how to properly respond to the user to educate them about Stack Exchange and its practices.

This one, for instance: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/18667/esp8266-returns-invalid-cause-4ESP8266 Returns 'invalid' - Cause 4

Right now, Aug 7, 2016, 8:31am EST, the Top Questions page says this question was modified 7 hours ago. But the newest time stamp on the question's own page is 8 months old.

I often read old, bumped questions with "modified x hours ago" stamps in the Top Questions list, only to find nothing new.

I'm aware that an unanswered-question bot occasionally feeds the current-question queue, but it doesn't add anything to the question or its answers. Does up/down-voting bump the question? Voting doesn't add any to the content, either, or at least what it adds is minimal and qualitatively different from an edit, comment, or answer.

Or is it something recent that has been deleted? If there is no new content, listing it as having a recent update just adds noise to the Top Questions list.

Listing an old question isn't unreasonable in and of itself, but perhaps the "modified x hours ago" is being applied too liberally.

Update:


  Where do you see this timestamp?
  That question seems to have fallen off the bottom of the page now, so let's take a more recent example:


https://i.stack.imgur.com/qR7vx.png

On the Top Questions page at 160809,1322 UTC, this question's listing says "Modified 1 hour ago, Community". But on reading the question page, the most recent change I see is stamped May 11-th.

I can only see "active yesterday" (a few hours have probably elapsed by now).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It was *bumped* by Community at 2016-08-07 04:44:45Z.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I'm suggesting is that while I understand the reason for bumping, it doesn't modify the content. Perhaps a different wording on the timestamp would be appropriate, such as "Bumped  hours ago"? That would alert folks who might go looking for "What got added?", not to.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where do you see this timestamp? I can't find that question with a "modified yesterday (or x hours ago)" message next to it. I can only see *active* yesterday. "Active" doesn't imply modified. Feel free to add a screenshot to your question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(Question updated)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After talking to the other moderators and Community Managers (a step up from a moderator) it appears that this is a limitation of the Stack Exchange software. In order to "bump" a thread it has to be marked as modified. So, working as intended, even if that is not perfectly ideal. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, thanks for that, NIck. Do you you know, can a question so stamped be assumed to have no changes or might one sometimes have new content?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose it is possible it was bumped because someone actually did amend an answer, so it could be ambiguous. Judging by the response I got (in my answer) this won't necessarily be fixed in the near future.


















More and more questions seem to be asking about ESP8266 programed via the Arduino IDE and running "Arduino" code, and quite a few about ESP8266 and NodeMCU.
1. Is it OK to ask about ESP8266 programed as an Arduino?
2. Should questions asking about ESP8266 programmed using LUA, etc. be closed as off topic?
3. What about questions about ESP8266 hardware are they off topic too?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is an ESP8266 running Arduino code question allowed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My initial reaction is "I'm not sure". We seem to be getting some questions that are only slightly related to Arduinos. I'm not sure what the boundary is for Arduino-related compared to general-electronics-related.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Essentially, you either have to allow questions about alternate hardware running Arduino-style software layers, or else ban everything that is not an ATmega-based solution.  Once things like the Due, and later Intel contraptions came on the scene the floodgates were opened, and at this point there is no entity who gets to say what is vs. isn't an Arduino in the worldwide context.  More generally, the question is evidence of why arbitrary subdivision of embedded topics into Arduino, pi, and everything else is demonstrably a fundamental mistake.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Ironically this question should be in meta` - it *is* in meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`at this point there is no entity who gets to say what is vs. isn't an Arduino in the worldwide context` - I think that's the first time I've been called an entity. :P However I'm inclined to agree with @ChrisStratton that the distinction between Arduino and not-Arduino is becoming rather blurred.


















For me, here are suitable cases:


Problem setting Arduino IDE to "talk to" ESP8266, possibly including wiring, as this is directly related to Arduino IDE
Problem connecting ESP8266 to an Arduino, be it a wiring or program issue, as long as the program in on Arduino side


However, the following cases are off-topic:


Issue with NodeMCU, lua language
Issue with ESP8266 API
Issue with connecting an ESP8266 to anything else than Arduino

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with all your points above but what about the case where someone has switched out an Arduino for an ESP8266, using the same (similar) code, IDE and peripherals?  If someone was trying to measure range with an UNO and ultrasonic sensor and then switched the UNO for an ESP?  I thinks its OK to answer questions where the ESP is being used as a stand in for an Arduino, but does anyone agree?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a matter of fact, ESP8266 and Arduino are 2 VERY different beasts, and having a similar program will not show the same effects (and defects). The case you describe seems dedicated to ESP8266 experts, not Arduino experts. For me this should go to EE rather than here, until some more specific site is defined.


















I think it depends on how you see "Arduino". Arduino started as Arduino.cc: a (open hardware) board and (open source) software provider.

However Arduino has moved on, and now the community "Arduino" is far more important then the companies (arduino.cc and arduino.org).  

The "core" of this community is the API the company Arduino designed. The community added lots of libraries on top of and extending this API. The community ported the API to other processors. Anyone porting this API/libraries to a other board adds the boards to the community.
As the Arduino API and many of its libraries are ported to ESP8266 based boards; implementations on these boards using the Arduino API and libraries belong to the Arduino community (but are not strictly speaking Arduino).  

As stackexchange is a community driven site I think it would be weird to pick the company card and not the community card. Therefore IMHO these boards should be supported here.  

Another way to look at it: if you ask this question for ESP8266 based boards; why don't you ask this question for Teensy boards or adafruit boards and other vendors? What sets ESP8266 apart that you ask it for ESP8266 and not for others? Do you realize that Paul Stoffregen (maker of Teensy) did lots (if not most) of the multi platform implementations in Arduino?   

Suppose we leave out all non real Arduino boards, ..... what with arduino.org versus arduino.cc .... Will we only support Arduino.org boards? Or Arduino.cc?
Do you really want to go into this discussion? I don't.  

For me Arduino is the Arduino community. I embraced ESP8266 just like I embraced Teensy and Adafruit. They are part of the community. Without them the company Arduino is nothing.

  Does up/down-voting bump the question? 


No, voting does not bump questions. https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/48578/226837Only answers and edits do.


  Or is it something recent that has been deleted? If there is no new content, listing it as having a recent update just adds noise to the Top Questions list.


No, it is a tool to move question with too few visits and answers randomly to the top of the queue. A small detail: You are not ordering questions by newest or hottest, but by 'activity' (in your screenshot). Here is an excerpt from the FAQ:


  
  The Community user will bump non-negatively scored questions that https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/48578/226837have at least one answer scoring 0 and none scoring more than that.
  
  
  Questions are https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/99690picked randomly from the top-viewed inactive questions.
  The number of unanswered questions bumped per hour depends on the site: 4 per hour on Stack Overflow, 1 per hour on Meta, and 2 per hour on Super User and Server Fault. The default for a new site is https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/1845111 per hour.
  
  


That should answer your question, as far as I understand it.

https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/7523/syed-zain-nasir?tab=profileThis user just awakened an ancient thread on https://electronics.stackexchange.com/EE.SE simply to promote his own article. He tried to make it look like it was not his article - obvious spam, nothing to see, please move along.

Now, I don't take kindly to spammers, so I checked his account here on Arduino.SE, and.. it's complicated.

Every post but two has a link to his personal website, often without further comment and almost never even hinting that he wrote them. He also doesn't mention the answers, but forces people to click through. So far, so bad.

What's problematic is that the information in the link may very well be good answers to the questions, sometimes the only answer. I'm not sure what to make of this. I don't want to flag all the posts as spam. Maybe a stern warning from a moderator is in order?

I know too little about the culture here at Arduino.SE, but I feel that something is not right with those posts.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Somewhat helpful but still spammy user - Not sure what to do about itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this to my attention! I have a quick question: how do you know that these are *his* articles that he is linking to? Most of them should be removed anyway as they are "link only answers," but I can't see anything to prove that the sites that he links to are his own. (Please reply to me using `@Anonymous` somewhere in your message so I'll get a notification that you replied to me.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5At the bottom of one of the linked pages (at least) are the words by the author: "I am Syed Zain Nasir". So, he is self-identifying as the author on the target site. It isn't as obvious on the SE posts he is linking to his own pages. Personally I usually say "my page ..." rather than "see this page" to make it clear I am referencing my own work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AnonymousPenguin Indeed, what Nick Gammon says, all the articles he links to has "By Syed Zain Nasir" in the top bar, and they end with "I am Syed Zain Nasir, the founder of The Engineering Projects (TEP)."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we might just comment on his answers and mention he should provide more details. Putting links (even to one's own posts) does not seem bad too me, as long as the articles are related to the question (obviously!) AND the content of the linked article is put back (in part, only the relevant stuff) into the answer. Adding a claim that the answerer is also the poster of the linked article might be welcome too, but not mandatory from my viewpoint.


















At last Arduino is back together again.

We seem to be getting quite a few answers flagged as "not an answer". Whilst some certainly were not answers, others seem to be flagged simply because they didn't fully answer the question, or were a bad answer.

If we look at the pop-up box for flagging we see this:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHMjq.png

Notice that the flag needs that the answer does not attempt to answer the question. Examples could be:


Gibberish
Someone saying they have the same problem as in the question
The original poster (OP) clarifying the question in an answer rather than editing the original question
Asking a new question as an answer
Someone seeking clarification of the question (this should be done as a comment on the question)
Someone commenting on one of the other answers




However these are not suitable for flagging as "not an answer":


Bad answers
Wrong answers
Incomplete answers




In these cases you, the user of this site, have options available to you. You can:


Add a comment explaining why you think the answer is wrong
Vote the answer down (preferably commenting why you are doing this, so that a third party will understand why an answer got down votes)

A good method is to leave a comment to educate the OP that what he/she has done is not in-step with the Stack Exchange system. After all, the aim of this site is that the community builds up and educate other users, in order to improve the overall quality of the site. 

We then leave it up to the OP to do the right thing; revert the question back to the original and post the solution as an answer and accept it.

As an example, @Chris Stratton posted this eloquent https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/21309/error-while-loading-libtinfo-so-5-solvedcomment:

When was the CircuitLab feature (and its icon) added to arduino.stackexchange?

I've been seeing this trend where people, who post questions that are related to problems with their code, just post the part of their code that they think is "pertinent" for the public. How should I respond to that? It's getting quite annoying and I don't know if any of you are seeing this too.

It's a well-known problem. I set up a web site a while ago: http://snippets-r-us.com/Snippets R Us! to address this issue.

I've seen plenty of times a post that "this must be the problem" (posting a couple of lines of code) and "this can't possibly be the problem" (omitting a whole lot of code).

A useful comment you can make is:


  Please post a https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcveMinimal, Complete, and Verifiable example

Our beloved chatroom: "Pin 13" is frozen (due to inactivity).

Can we re-open the chatroom?

Theoretically, we could start a new chatroom, but that wouldn't be a very neat solution (it can be hard to find anything back, if we keep making new "Pin 13"'s.

Can we avoid getting it frozen?

How to avoid getting the same problem in the future? Can a room be pinned, or made as default general chat of a certain SE? Or do we have to program an Arduino to post random links to it every now and then? ;D

Should we even?

The room is frozen, since it was inactive. Theoretically, this means that the room seems to have little function.

Though I believe that it can be usefull to have a general chat.

But it may be inactive from time to time.


















I've unfrozen it.


  How can it be beloved and inactive at the same time?


Dat Ha has a good point. It has gone recently for 32 days without activity.

If it goes for 14 days without activity it is frozen automatically. I suggest you chat away in it from time to time to stop that happening.

My question was also: 'should we even', if anyone has an interesting topic, he/she could create a room specific for that topic. But it feels a little odd to not have a general chat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems the Arduino users aren't all that chatty. I think a lot of other parts of Stack Exchange have quite active chat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a lot of foreigners and one-time visitors, very few seem to stay.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah well. It's a bit of a different environment to (say) cooking, where if you are interested in it you are likely to stay and discuss things. Being an environment for newbies, the Arduino SE tends to attract people who just want to get their homework done. Of course, this isn't everyone.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it happened again



















75% of users on this site turn up, ask one question, get their answer, and are never seen again.
22% of users on this site turn up, ask one question, don't bother waiting around for an answer, and are never seen again.
2% of users on this site are those that show an interest and either want to help others or have an inquiring mind that wants to learn more.

(Statistics source: the back of my sofa)

Of all the users on the site maybe 3% would find it useful. 1% of those would use it to whinge about the 97% that never come back, the others wouldn't even know it was there.

So what use is a general chat room? Most chat discussions are related to a specific question/answer and thus are between just a couple of people for a short time, and those chat rooms can be created at will as they are needed.

But it's not the only one, probably also why the beta takes so long or question quality is low on average (afaik)? I'm not sure if and how we can improve it, I think it's because Arduino is specifically aimed at hobbyists. Which also isn't something that could/would/should change?  The main point was that I thought it would be weird to just give up on a general chat because of it, but a general chat also needs a topic from time to time. (And in that case we could use a designated chatroom aswel)


















Can we get the commonly used close reason of "shopping questions not allowed" added?


  I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because questions seeking recommendations for specific products or places to purchase them are off-topic as they are rarely useful to others and quickly obsolete. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/Instead, describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve.


That text is taken direct from the ElectronicEngineering SE. Their https://electronics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp pages have:


  and it is not about …
  
  
  a shopping or buying recommendation
  


It does make a bit of a grey line with our help files:


  On topic:
  
  Board recommendations. Make sure to include detailed information about the project you are doing and your requirements. If your question is too vague, it may be put on hold.


Asking which board would be best for a specific job, or finding out the differences between boards, I would say is fine. Asking where to buy something from, or a vague "I can't buy X because I can't find it in my local shop, what could I get instead?" should be closed as off topic.

This gives a definite reason why the question is closed, not just vague "too broad" or "opinion based" or "unclear what you're asking".

The blog post linked in the close reason text above (and copied http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/here so you don't have to scroll up) gives a good discussion about the sentiment behind it.

We do have a Hardware Recommendations SE these days where users can be directed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are required to consult with the community before adding more close reasons, so let's wait and see what others think. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NickGammon I have fleshed the proposal out with more detail.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NickGammon: `Do you have any recent questions that warrant this?` Here are some not so recent but still.... http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/18277/buying-arduino-parts-different-manufacturers, http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/20524/ball-launcher-machine-what-parts-to-get, http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/6769/help-with-parts-identification-from-arduino-starter-kit-from-aliexpress, http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/11640/arduino-stepper-motor-standing-desk-help/11641#11641b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Finding them is not that easy, since they often get closed for other reasons (I know I close them for other reasons - sometimes even using the text above) - so they disappear from the listings. We don't suffer as much as EE, which on an average day has two or three just on the front page - often more. I shall flag them up here as they arrive though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One just cropped up: http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/32603/ir-laser-speckleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And another: http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/32610/gps-module-to-a-bluetooth-transmitterb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's really tempting to have this reason, on the other hand there are a fair number of posters whose key problem is that they bought the wrong thing (classically a bipolar bridge motor shield, or in some cases, an Arduino for a problem where it is not a resonable solution) so an outright ban on shopping questions may not always be unproductive.  Many of them can be closed as off topic since they aren't really about Arduino but about something else - like that laser module one.


















It seems we moderators have the power to add a new reason for closing as off-topic, although it needs more than one of us to approve it.

To guide us, please vote up Majenko's suggestion if you approve of it (and vote it down if you don't). Comments or replies can also be used to argue for or against this proposal.

IMHO, too many questions are closed for being "_Unclear what you are asking_" when, in reality, it is perfectly clear what is being asked - it's just that "_Unclear what you are asking_" is being used as a catch-all where there isn't a better alternative.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sempaiscuba By all means vote up my answer as a way of approving it, also Majenko's (if you haven't already). What is the specific wording you want to add?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I'm quite happy with the wording for this reason.  I just think that before we add one new custom close reason, we should try to get consensus on what _all_ our custom close reasons should be.  This [answer](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2592/33608) to another question here on meta illustrates the problem I was talking about.


















Arduino, along with a couple of other subjects, are quite precise. I mean, all programming questions mostly consern the Arduino IDE and I find that the Arduino.cc's tutorial section rubish.

After looking at what Stack Overflow has in there documentation section, I would find it very convinient and great if we can import that into this site. It has many GREAT tutorials that could solve around 5% of the questions on this site (just a guess, no actual numbers).

And if we, as the Arduino comunity put a little more effort into it, we can turn it into the (maybe) greatest Arduino tutorial book / site out there. I see a lot of benefits for it. Mostly that We can share a lot of knowlage without having to ask a precise question.

So who's with me?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should Arduino SE get a documentation section?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Beginners tend to not read documentation, but certainly I agree in principle that good documentation is very important. I'm not sure if the SO documentation project can be used here, but if it can it sounds like a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would suggest that it could be a prominent part of the tour so people would know about it.  Like the programming tag and Prettify and the Markdown Editor Help section.  (And we should have a LaTex tag if that's what it takes to be able to copy answers from EE SE to here without the need to reformat our math into FORTRAN 77b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can make an answering bot: it automatically google the question and offers the first search result from this site as answer.

I'm not sure documentation per se is going to be useful. As Nick has noted reading documentation is something that many of our incoming users ("Ardueenies") are averse to doing.

Another thing they seem averse to doing is searching. The number of duplicate questions we get seems to be rather high. So instead of spending our time on documentation, it may be better to put our efforts into crafting "FAQ" questions where we cover, in detail, a specific topic. Then when we get a question that asks what that FAQ question covers we just close it as a duplicate pointing to the FAQ question.

This has proved successful on EE, especially for the question "What power supply do I want" or "Will my power supply blow up my project because of too many amps" and similar that seem to get asked about every 15 minutes. They all get almost immediately closed as a duplicate of "https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/34745/choosing-power-supply-how-to-get-the-voltage-and-current-ratingsChoosing power supply, how to get the voltage and current ratings?"

Questions that people ask all the time that could be covered by this kind of thing (please suggest more):


I have added a shield that has pins in all the Arduino's holes. Can I still use some of them?
Can I run my Arduino of XXX power supply?
Can I use an external power supply for my Arduino and still plug it into the USB? Will it blow up?
How do you merge two k0d3z together? Will do you it for me? plz?
How do I communicate between my Arduino and my PC / a Website / Neptune?
What is the extra 6 pin header for on the Uno R3?


The list could go on for miles I am sure. Building up a store of these good quality in-depth answers would not only make life easier on us, since we would have to write less answers in the long run, but also would help the people asking the questions as they then get handed a well crafted, well thought out, detailed answer to their question instead of a half-arsed answer that we can't be bothered to flesh out because the same question has been asked time and time again and if only they'd spend the time doing a little searching, reading, and thinking about what they have found they would come up with the answer themselves.

FAQ comes to mind.  I am amazed how many times I post a question on Google only to be directed to a 3-year-old answer posted in EE SE or here.  Maybe in the tour it could be made clear that we are not a free software-production service.  Even better, perhaps automate the "Welcome ... take the tour" thing also.  That way it doesn't look like any particular one of us is trying to act like a gatekeeper.  (Mea culpa)


















https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2412/should-arduino-se-get-a-documentation-sectionHere is a question that is already asked with a similar intension. But i am trying to be more specific.

Let me explain how my question is different. Even-though they are towards the same goal, the linked question seems to be very generic and would invite a wide spectrum of answers. This question explains why we need a documentation for arduino, with example.

FAQ is of course the best thing for beginners. but looking at the bigger picture, just like we have documentation for C#, which is indeed helpful because it is more understandable and generic than the QAs.

The number of questions unnecessarily increase(Not an issue..) if people don't find the exact question(even-though people find similar ones).
just like how i need to ask this question.

Consider a situation where i need to interface some new module to my arduino, i am looking into Arduino SE and find find questions that are related. like "How to connect my XX module?", "I have tried this code to interface XX module but is not working" etc. but, a beginner would be more interested in a more descriptive document which would help him do his job from the beginning, till the end.

hope i am making some sense.

This is really why I find it great if specific SEs such as Arduino, Pi, (cooking?!?)..... should get documentation. Though we might get more "useless" questions, making some stuff clear is very important.

  Should I post this code modification as an answer myself? 


It seems odd for someone to "answer" a question by editing the question instead of posting an answer.

If you think the edit helps you might make an answer yourself, attributing it to some anonymous editor.


  Also, who are these anonymous users?


That's another odd thing. Perhaps the fact that the question was migrated from another part of SE explains that bit.

Someone clearly is trying to (possibly legitimately) edit the question. See  [here](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/22263). I have rejected it again, to be on the safe side.

Well I've left a comment on the question. However, it is odd that, as they have an account that it still comes through as anon user...

This question, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/34127/how-to-compile-the-bootloader-mega-2560-to-57600-speedHow to compile the bootloader mega 2560 to 57600 speed?, by a new user, has four close votes, but no comments.

Yes, it is a terrible question, as it stands, and yes, if it was from a seasoned user, then it could/should be voted to close without  comment, as they should know better.

However, as this is a new user, who probably doesn't understand how SE works, a little prompt in a comment, won't hurt. Yes, they should have read the "tour", but when you are looking for an answer, and you are new to SE, then having to wade through the tour, is the last thing on your mind.

I've left a comment, and if no update appears after a few days then yes, it should be closed, as the user has probably disappeared, found their own solution, or no longer cares.

The point I'm trying to make is that, if you are reviewing, and see a bad question, check to see how long the user has been on the site and bearing in mind that we were all "dumb" new users once, just give them a nod in the right direction...

I would go further ans say that comments should even comment on experienced users posts if they are not up to scratch. The reason: new users read these posts, so while you might not be educating the OP you will educate all those reading it!


















I realize beta sites don't have ads on the site, but I'd like to put one for the site on rotation at https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/ (they are being renewed for the year now).

If not and someone wants to whip something up, please do -- leave a comment if you need a bit of time, otherwise tomorrow I will.  Technically, the ads can be replaced after posting although that may be limited by when it crosses the upvote threshold.

I'm new (approx 2 months) to the SE community and right now I'm active only in two of its sites: Arduino beta and Electrical Engineering (EE). But I'm already amazed by how opposed the cultures of these two sites are.

EE has a somewhat wack-a-noob attitude and is very unforgiving of users that don't show any research effort or previous work before asking their questions. After reading a lot of posts from EE meta, I think the reason for that seems to be a widespread concern that valuable contributors will fly away out of frustration if the quality bar is lowered, thus making the site worse off. That looks like a legitimate concern for an already stablished site to me, although they sometimes push it too hard.

And then there's the Arduino site, where the concerns seem to be very different from those in EE. After reading Arduino meta, my feeling is (correct me if I'm wrong, please) that the two main concerns here are "graduating from beta" and "attract and being friendly to users that might not have any experience in electronics and/or coding, and who get bashed in EE and/or SO". Both concerns seem perfectly legitimate to me, but do they lead to be excessively tolerant of poor questions/answers?

Maybe this is not the right time to be worrying about valuable contributors flying away out of frustration with poor questions/answers by new users that shot their questions, take their answers and run to never come back once they got what they want (often leaving unaccepted answers behind). Or is it? Is the desire to graduate from beta allowing too many poor questions/answers go through, and ultimately hurting the graduation of the site by silently driving away valuable contributors? What do you think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does a (legitimate) desire to graduate from beta lead to be (excessively) tolerant of poor questions and/or answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It depends on what the aim is of the SE. On Arduino.SE we aim to help anyone interested in developing/discovering Arduino. These people, very often are beginners. Once you go professional on microcontrollers, you'll most likely not use Arduino and even place your questions on EE.SEb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you. However, there are begginers that ask good questions and some that don't (maybe just because they don't plan to be around for too long). Should those two kinds of begginers be treated equal?


















[Terminology note: in this answer I'm using the word "clone" as the original poster used it; most of the devices he and I are discussing would be called "derivatives" in the https://blog.arduino.cc/2013/07/10/send-in-the-clones/Arduino taxonomy.]

Yes, clones are absolutely on topic. "Arduino" most often refers not to specific hardware devices but the ecosystem that allows people easily to play with a lot of different hardware and software, usually (https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/command-linebut not always) using the Arduino IDE. Much as "PCs" quickly evolved to a general set of platforms with a lot of characteristics in common rather than a specific set of machines built by IBM, Arduino from the beginning, with opening of the specifications and designs, been aimed at this; the https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introductionofficial introduction states:


  All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs.


The commitment of both Arduino (the company) and the semi-official (SparkFun, AdaFruit) and unofficial community to this is demonstrated by:


https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/StandaloneInstructions for building a clone* on the official Arduino site itself.
Different form factors both https://store.arduino.cc/product/A000005official and https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14083unofficial.
Microcontrollers ranging from slightly https://store.arduino.cc/product/A000069(ATmegta2560) to moderately http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark(ATtiny) to rather https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp32-thing-hookup-guide#installing-the-esp32-arduino-core(ESP32) to greatly https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero(ARM Cortex) different.
Libraries offering similar functionality amongst https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerialofficial releases, http://arduiniana.org/libraries/newsoftserial/unoffical libraries that become official, and http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.htmlother unofficial libraries that are suggested in official library documentation as alternatives.


I personally think one of the most beautiful projects I've even seen in the the Ardunio SE is https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/30694/31794Nick Gammon's torch locator, which involves nothing at all found on arduino.cc except the IDE, yet shows so much of the spirit of what Arduino is: useful real-world interaction, a good smidgen of hobbyist-level EE knowledge (the analysis of the expected lifetime), and "we don't need no ARM CPU running Linux to do this." (The original question also hits many of these points, too, particularly with the novel application.)

Arduino has always been about experimentation and playing with not just the official things supplied by Arduino itself but with almost anything anybody can make that can be fit into the ecosystem. "Clones," made for many different reasons, and ranging from almost exact copies to very different things, are clearly a part of that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you meant ATtiny rather than "ATmini". Good answer +1!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes! Thanks for catching that. I've edited the post but, for things like this, you should feel free to edit other people's posts, too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I normally would do an edit but, unlike the regular Arduino Stack Exchange,  that feature is disabled for me on meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, so it is for answers not your own! Thanks for pointing that out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@CurtJ.Sampson - don't re-edit your past **misrepresentation** of the Arduino website into this.  What you link is not instructions for creating a "clone" - but rather a functional alternative on a breadboard.  The actual Arduino policy on "clones" is here: https://blog.arduino.cc/2013/07/10/send-in-the-clones/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am using "clone" in the sense the original poster used it, not in the particular and strict definition used on the page you referenced ("there may be cases where a clone's features, layout, and/or spec deviate from the norm"). As I said, if you have an issue with this, make your own answer to claim that what the original poster and I are talking about are not "clones."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisStratton: I've removed (again) the change you made to my answer and added a note explaining that the original poster and I are using a fairly loose definition of "clone." (We have good reasons for doing this.) Please don't re-start your edit war.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmmm, might sound petty, but I think I would have to agree with @ChrisStratton. The link is not how to make a clone (as in a *Chinese clone*, for example) but how to build a *Barebones* Arduino on a breadboard. The term **Clone** is generally used for a commercial rip off, whereas the term **Barebones** is generally used for an ATmega328 on a homemade PCB, stripboard/vero/ breadboard. I would assume that the former is the sense in which Peter (the OP) meant by *clone*, and certainly how I read the question - until I saw your answer, which IMHO uses the term "clone" rather misleadingly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline So what if I make a rip-off of the Arduino design, change it by building it on a breadboard per the article on the Arduino website, and sell that commercially? Is that a "clone" now? If "clone" dicussions were disallowed, would it be ok for me to discuss that breadboard here because I built it myself, but not ok for someone else to discuss that exact same breadboard if I'd sold it to him?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You would be selling a barebones Arduino kit on a breadboard, not a clone. You have not cloned an Arduino board design, with the PCB that it entails, per se. There is a lot more additional circuitry on a Arduino board (be it Uno, Mega, Micro, Mini or what have you), than there is on the barebones/standalone breadboarded version that you link to. Besides, I never stated that we can't, or should not, discuss clones here. I own exclusively clones, never bought an original. The issue is that you call the standalone a clone, when it isn't. *Nowhere* on that page is the word "clone" even mentioned.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline That it's on breadboard instead of a PCB, has different parts, whatever, all come under "there may be cases where a clone's features, layout, and/or spec deviate from the norm, whether by mistake or by design." If you have an issue with calling things like that "clones", you need to take it up with question poster, not me, since I am simply using the terminology he used in the question. If you interpret his terminology differently, you ought to post an answer of your own explaining things in that light.


















Our current "How to ask" box reads:


  How To Ask
  Is your question about Arduino?
  We prefer questions that can be answered, not just discussed.
  Provide details. Share your research.
  If your question is about this website, https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/ask it on meta instead.
  https://arduino.stackexchange.com/helpvisit the help center »
  https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askasking help »  


It provides only general guidelines, as does the "asking help" page to which it links. (That page says, e.g., "be specific" without providing much guidance on how to be specific.)

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisitionDreyfus model of skill acquisition indicates that novices will not be able to well follow general advice and guidelines and instead should be presented with specific things to do; as they increase in expertise they will then be able to start applying more abstract rules and guidelines.

In answering my first couple of dozen questions on this site I've seen some particular recurring patterns with simple fixes, such as poorly formatted code and lack of background information, that made answers more difficult and time-consuming for me. I believe these problems could be mitigated by providing some much more specific direction to novices asking questions. Further, I think that in the course of following this advice novices might be lead to do a bit more research that would make there questions better, though I admit that might be more hopeful thinking than reality.

Should we add more specific advice aimed complete novices and, if so, how should we do it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Encouraging Better Questions: Adding Specific Points to "How to Ask" Boxb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're assuming people read that information. It seems to me that no one ever does...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I totally feel your pain. (Actually, no I probably don't, really. I would guess I don't feel even 1% of your pain. I don't even know if I _understand_ 1% of your pain.) Nonetheless, I'm willing to do further writing in the (possibly naïve) hope that this might help, if someone who has the power to change these things thinks it's worth the effort. If you think it's not, I'm willing to accept that, too. I've only been around a month or so, so it's hard for me to judge.


















I propose we do the following:


Create a "Question Checklist" help page (hopefully with a better name) that provides a list of clear, simple and very specific actions that beginners can take to improve their questions. (See below for my initial go at this.)
Change the "How to ask box" to add, "Review the question checklist page before posting your question and ensure you've fixed all applicable issues."
Change the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/askingAsking page in the help center to say, at the top, "Before pressing the post button go through the question checklist page to see if there are any easy improvements from that list you can make. This will increase the chance of your question getting a response."


Here are some things I think should be on the checklist:


Have you been following a guide or other documentation? If so, provide a link to it.
Do you talk about a specific Arduino board? If so, provide a link to a product page for that board.
Do you have a specific device attached to your Arduino, such as a sensor or network interface? If so, provide a link to the datasheet for that device or the chip on it. If you can't find the datasheet, at least provide a link to a product page.
Are you calling code in a library? If so, include a link to the documentation for that library (perhaps https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Librariesone of these, perhaps something from elsewhere).
Have you included code in your post? If so, make sure that it's nicely formatted to be easily readable.
Do you have more than 20 lines of code in your post? If so, remove extra functionality that you can remove that still leaves the problem behind (i.e., the remaining code still demonstrates the problem you're having). Make sure you test your new, smaller code to confirm it still demonstrates the problem.

Not sure if this is the best place to ask, but

The Arduino icon no longer appears on https://arduino.stackexchange.com/https://arduino.stackexchange.com/ although it is on this Meta.

One user was kind enough to send me the list of SE sites that support MathJax (LaTex), and I see Arduino is not among them.  

This means that when I learn something relevant on EE SE and want to use it on Arduino SE I have to reformat all the equations back to the basics.  

I would like to request that Arduino SE add this capability.  

Here is the list.  It sticks out like a sore thumb that Arduino is not among the dozens that can do it:

I just hope somebody gets off the dime and makes it so we are compatible with the EE SE.  They have a lot to offer us.  Sure, they argue more than we do, but that's because they had to endure 5 years of college to earn the title of Electrical Engineer.  And afterwards a lot of them have had decades of work experience.  It is a great SE.  And all I want is to be able to copy (with attribution, of course), some of their solutions over here without having to convert it to FORTRAN.  ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just successfully got LaTex to work on a WordPress site, and it was free.

  INTEL DISCONTINUES JOULE, GALILEO, AND EDISON PRODUCT LINES
  
  http://hackaday.com/2017/06/19/intel-discontinues-joule-galileo-and-edison-product-lines/Reposted from Hackaday
  
  Sometimes the end of a product’s production run is surrounded by publicity, a mix of a party atmosphere celebrating its impact either good or bad, and perhaps a tinge of regret at its passing. Think of the last rear-engined Volkswagens rolling off their South American production lines for an example.
  
  Then again, there are the products that die with a whimper, their passing marked only by a barely visible press release in an obscure corner of the Internet. Such as this week’s discontinuances from Intel, in a series of PDFs lodged on a document management server announcing the end of their Galileo (PDF), Joule (PDF), and Edison (PDF) lines. The documents in turn set out a timetable for each of the boards, for now they are still available but the last will have shipped by the end of 2017.
  
  It’s important to remember that this does not mark the end of the semiconductor giant’s forray into the world of IoT development boards, there is no announcement of the demise of their Curie chip, as found in the Arduino 101. But it does mark an ignominious end to their efforts over the past few years in bringing the full power of their x86 platforms to this particular market, the Curie is an extremely limited device in comparison to those being discontinued.
  
  Will the departure of these products affect our community, other than those who have already invested in them? It’s true to say that they haven’t made the impression Intel might have hoped, over the years only a sprinkling of projects featuring them have come our way compared to the flood featuring an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi. They do seem to have found a niche though where there is a necessity for raw computing power rather than a simple microcontroller, so perhaps some of the legion of similarly powerful ARM boards will plug that gap.
  
  So where did Intel get it wrong, how did what were on the face of it such promising products fizzle out in such a disappointing manner? Was the software support not up to scratch, were they too difficult to code for, or were they simply not competitively priced in a world of dirt-cheap boards from China?


So it's goodbye from Intel then. I just knew they didn't have any real staying power. Another "We'll have a slice of that cake, thank you very much. Oh, we don't have a clue what we're doing with it. What's cake?"

If you read the comments under the original posting you'll see the main consensus is that it's Intel's abysmal documentation (i.e., none unless you are buying $10bn worth of chips from them a year) that was the main cause of their failure.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pah! Don't you just hate these fly-by-night mavericks?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Que lastima*... lol.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Intel strategy leaves much room for... "*surprises*"... at present, to say the least [along with an enormous euphemism].


















It's been a long road (over 1200 days, and that's just counting this most recent attempt at building an Arduino community), but I have good news:

Arduino Stack Exchange is graduating!

Congratulations to all who participated, especially the moderators and regular users who gave so much of their time and effort. Reaching "mature community" status is a big milestone, and you should be very proud.

After you graduate, there will be some changes around here. Graduation works in two phases. The first phase starts now, and includes the following benefits:


You will no longer see the "beta" label attached to your site's name.
You will become eligible for question migration paths to/from the rest of the network.
You will be able to participate in the next round of community ads. There'll be a separate post here on meta soon about setting those up; if you don't know what community ads are, check out https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9463/community-promotion-ads-2016an example of how they'll work over on Code Golf SE.
You get to enter the line for a community moderator election. Based on the number of other sites waiting, your election should happen in August.


Later, the site will still receive a full custom design from one of our staff designers, which will be packaged with an increase in the amount of reputation needed to access each privilege. It's no secret that our backlog for site designs is long, so instead of making you wait to receive all the parts of graduation at once, we wanted to https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754/feedback-requested-design-independent-graduationgive you the things we could give you now. We think we've hammered out most of the bugs in the process, but there are still likely to be some left. If you come across anything out of place, please report it on https://meta.stackexchange.com/Meta Stack Exchange using the [graduating-sites] tag.

This community has reached this point because of your generous contributions. Together, you've created a valuable resource that helps a lot of people, including many who never type a word of their own on the site. Congratulations again on all you've accomplished!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Congratulations, Arduino SE is graduating!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5:-) Great Job, guys!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5About time!

Congrats from the Electrical Engineering SE :) I was wondering why it took so long lol. Maybe question migration will be easier for the both of us ;)


















Arduino.SE is graduating. Woohoo!

When a site graduates the reputation required to earn certain privileges eventually rises. My question is: will users lose privileges earned under beta rep thresholds, as their rep will be below the new thresholds? Are earned privileges kept after graduation?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Arduino.SE graduation: will users lose privileges?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is what happens when you make an overly narrow site for a subcategory of questions which belong on EESE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisStratton - this is what happens *when a site graduates*. You have this "problem" whether or not it is an "overly narrow site" (as you put it). See [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58587/reputation-requirements-compared) and [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/139432/reputation-privileges-when-a-beta-becomes-a-fully-fledged-site/). Trying to tie this to the sort of questions that might be asked on EE.SE is just a long and irrelevant bow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, Nick, the specific issue is cause by graduating *with too small a user community* which is in turn caused by *having a site with too narrow a mission*.  This is beyond obvious to anyone willing to take an *honest* look - which no doubt will be hard to those who've become caught up in this ill-conceived project to arbitrarily split off a small portion of EESE topics.


















Yes, I believe that the "full site" privileges will apply once we get the site design (which as Alex said could well be months away).

For reference, here is the current https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesprivileges list. Compare to the numbers for a full site such as https://electronics.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesElectrical Engineering Stack Exchange.

There are 29 users today who would have access to "edit questions and answers" (2000 rep).

One of the reasons why we took a while to graduate was that, https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2310/beta-progress-update-january-2016in January 2016, the Stack Exchange people noticed that we had very few people with enough privileges to do things like editing.

In the meantime, before we get our site design done, we all have time to increase our reputation. I notice that quite a few people have quite healthy rep levels, even though they only joined around 6 months ago. You could probably expect those to double in the next 6 months.


  Later, the site will still receive a full custom design ...


The word "later" is pretty open. We may well have a year to bump up privileges before the new levels are activated.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe the SE people are concerned about not having enough people with editing privileges, but I'm far more concerned (qualitywise) about having only 16 users today able to close questions (3,000 rep).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, but since the rep changes are likely to be 6 months away, there are a number of people (like you) who could double their rep in that time, and reach that threshold. All SE sites which graduate are likely to have similar issues, and they seem to have survived.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is fundamentally a demonstration of why Arduino should never have been a distinct site.  The pool of expertise to provide good answers, and the pool of high-rep users already exists on EESE; by creating an Arduino site, questions get shifted to disfunctional backwater and certain notorious curmudgeons on EESE get a migration option / closure excuse they've developed an impressive track record of abusing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps the "notorious curmudgeons" are why people prefer to post here? Arduino is targetted at beginners, some people on EE.SE don't seem to be able to accept that fact.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Example of a similar thing: [English Language Learners Stack Exchange](https://ell.stackexchange.com/) vs. [English Language and Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NickGammon Stack Exchange rules are Stack Exchange rules - same here as on EESE.  Arduino is not only about beginners, and beginners use many things other than Arduino, so the association is illogical, and counterproductive as it artificially divides similar questions which should be being handled together.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For people concerned about the reputation/privileges issue I'd like to make a suggestion: Make a little more effort to upvote good answers. A big problem I see with this Stack Exchange is that generally the people asking questions have no interest in accepting answers or upvoting. The main way for people to gain reputation here is upvotes from the regulars.


















There's only one way to find out.

I think guys that doesn't know the Ohm's law and doesn't know how to program are beyond redemption. And they want help building an intergalactic laser shooting robot by 2:00 PM, fast! 

No amount of help will do any good for them. They are people that don't make any effort learning; they come here to have someone solve their needs.

This kind of posts degrade this site quality. They are not good for the OP and for the rest, it is just junk, pollution.

I vote for a quicker and stricter repeal of junk posts.

I have seen some ironic, rude and not that inviting/welcoming comments and how is this hurting the SE Arduino's reputation?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Programming is hard; so is electronic. You need years of study to reach just entry-level skills. You can't replace years of study with random tips & advices from Internet. People that think so are *dilettantes*, persons who takes up an art, activity, or subject merely for amusement, especially in a desultory or superficial way.


















What level of knowledge do you demand from users asking questions? What's the minimum standard required?

I think the minimun for programing is: You must able to download and install a IDE, write, compile and correctly run the http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTestFizz Buzz test (with output thru Serial Monitor). This test doesn't require any electric skill.

For electrical: You must know Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Law (KCL, KVL). You must be able to calculate voltage and current in simple circuits with resistors, leds and buttons. You must understand serial and parallel connections.

Moderators resolve issues like spam or abuse, where things happen that fall outside the normal voting tools available to all trusted users. I would not expect a moderator to close a question because the user doesn't have enough knowledge. I would expect the general community to possibly do that by down-voting or voting-to-close.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmmm - (referring to the thread in question) a question isn't really off-topic because it is full of logic errors. It's off-topic if it asks about (say) a Raspberry Pi. Can you reword this question to concentrate on the **moderator** aspect? For example: *What would you do if two users start insulting each other about not having sufficient knowledge to post on this site?*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will keep my question as it is. I'm really interested in the candidates' opinion on the subject, even if it's not a direct part of their duties.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough! I'll post my suggested question as another one then, since I think the concept of two users flaming each other is a good one to ask about.


















I don't think there can be any fixed rule, you have to go with you gut.

Normally I wouldn't up vote all answers, because it neutralises the vote if you vote for them all, but sometimes all the answers are good and you have to.

Personally I would down vote the answer "use a pull up resistor".  It doesn't explain why and that's more important.  I come here to learn things, and if I can share what I know, an instruction to do something fixes the immediate problem but doesn't fix the long term problem.

BUT that's just my opinion and you should go with yours. :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like your criteria: "instruction to do something fixes the immediate problem but doesn't fix the long term problem"



















  Must I upvote every good answer or only the best one in a question?


You don't have to up-vote anything. You might do nothing if, for example, the question and answer are not in your area of expertise (eg. the ESP8266). Sometimes people ask questions about some device I know nothing about. Therefore I can't say if the answer is good or bad, so I move on without voting.

If there are two or more answers I would be tempted to up-vote the better one. Sometimes they are both good so I will up-vote both of them.


  Must I upvote a correct answer in every question I look at?


No you don't. However remember how the reputation system works. Other users get reputation when you up-vote, and that helps them to get more tools to work with the site (like editing questions).

Up-voting also helps the person asking the question (they will probably choose the answer with the most up votes), and also others who look at the question later.



Down voting is useful if you think an answer is clearly wrong (or maybe doesn't even clearly answer the question). In those cases you can also add a comment (although you are not required to) explaining why you think the answer is wrong. These comments can help other people understand why an answer has down votes.



For really bad answers (like spam, or abuse) you can flag them for moderator attention. However don't flag answers that are just wrong, voting down is the correct approach there.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Help Center left things unexplained, like what "flag" means. I thought "flag" is something you do when you don't have the "close" option due low reputation. In the Help Center main page there is no "flag" entry. Now I know.


















Regarding why something has to be flagged/closed, do you believe that the actual system (a fix list of reasons) can be improved or changed for a better one? Can we, for example, add tags from a list, like we do posting a question? Such alternative adds flexibility without compromising the current classification.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This thread is for *questions to be asked of prospective moderators* at the forthcoming moderator election. Asking if we can add tags from a list is not something that a prospective moderator could usefully answer. This is, quite simply, a question that can be posted here on Meta as a question in its own right. Questions for moderator candidates are things like "if (x) happened what would you do?" or "would you be available to moderate on weekends?" - that sort of thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nick There are *moderators*, elected, and "moderation tools", gained after 2K. That's confusing. You are right, I'm wrong. Anyway, I have never seen any of the candidates here, and I can't vote for people unknow to me. Where you, Majenko, CodeGorilla running for the post, I will happily cast a vote. I think I have nothing to do in this process.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Going to adapt this into something more inquisitive towards candidates as opposed to suggesting a change to the system directly.


















I felt like questions with accepted answers were upvoted less often here than on other SE sites, so I decided to have a look at the Data Explorer:

select count(distinct Id) from Posts where Score > 0 and CreationDate > '2017-07-01' and AcceptedAnswerId is not null; --35
select count(distinct Id) from Posts where CreationDate > '2017-07-01' and AcceptedAnswerId is not null; --116


So, about 30% of questions with accepted answers were upvoted recently. I compared this with some of my other SE sites. 

Here's Electrical Engineering SE:

select count(distinct Id) from Posts where Score > 0 and CreationDate > '2017-07-01' and AcceptedAnswerId is not null; --359
select count(distinct Id) from Posts where CreationDate > '2017-07-01' and AcceptedAnswerId is not null; --748

which is about 53%.

So, we're a little bit on the low side. I wonder why this is? 

I'm a noob here myself, but I'd like to see more activity in the Arduino SE.  I just figure that if a question is good enough to be left open and receive an answer, with the OP active and polite enough to accept the answer, then in most cases giving the OP a little encouragement with an upvote on the question would help to encourage more participation. 

Also, this was a good excuse to play with the Data Explorer :)

Great use of the Data Explorer!



I've noticed that, in general, reputation creeps up fairly slowly here, compared to some other sites. I've got a lot more reputation for a handful of answers elsewhere (eg. English Learners SE) than I do for the same number of answers here. Quite often an answer isn't upvoted at all.

I think this is partly because of a mentality of:


I have a problem in my code, I'll ask here on Arduino SE
I've got my answer, kthxbye!


A while ago I was posting comments under answers along the lines of:


  If this helped you please up-vote it, and even accept the answer. This helps others know that the answer works.




You can help too by up-voting answers when you see them pop up (if you think they deserve it). I look for questions that Community (the system) has brought back to the first page, because no-one has accepted the answer, or voted for it. If the answer looks helpful, I vote it up. This helps stop old questions bobbing up all the time, and also helps other users know that someone thought the answer was OK.

It also helps give the person who answered some rep, which will help them get more https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesprivileges from Stack Exchange (like being able to delete answers, etc.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I 100% agree with everything you said here but I would like to point out that the topic was about upvoting questions rather than answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oops! *slaps self*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think good/correct answers not being accepted is a bigger problem, because it left lot of questions as *unanswered", which not true. I don't see how upvoting a question serve any purpose at all, because how many up-votes a question got it's not a criteria for anything.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"I don't see how upvoting a question serve any purpose at all". @Look Alterno, reputation points bestow privileges that allow users to more effectively participate in improving content. If someone is consistently asking good questions then they would likely also do a good job of reviewing other user's questions. Getting that sort of user up to the reputation points required for these privileges certainly has the potential to benefit Arduino Stack Exchange.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*how many up-votes a question got it's not a criteria for anything* - it is, though. Say you do a search for "working" and sort by votes, then the most up-voted question appears at the top. So, out of a set of questions which might ask similar things, the most up-voted question can be selected as the best question "of this sort". This can help you select the "best" question which might ask something you want to know, which also hopefully will have good answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Nick Different people have different search habits. I search with Google, not inside Arduino.SE, so I don't see *upvotes*. And, like many, I only look at first page results.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regardless of your search habits, the up-votes have a meaning on the site. That was my point.


















I think one factor is that we simply get a higher percentage of low quality questions here that are unclear, don't provide enough information, or are poorly formatted. We may eventually badger the author or edit enough to make the question upvote worthy in the end but by that point I don't feel the need to reward the author.

I suppose a better approach would be to simply evaluate the question as-is without regard for the history.

I do think this makes it even more important to upvote the high quality questions we do get.

For example, [Majenko](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/4143/majenko?tab=questions), who has the highest rep currently, has answered *1,795* questions! But he has asked *no questions!* You (per1234) have asked no questions. So voting your questions up isn't going to encourage you. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Low quality questions often don't get great answers, and even when they do, may not attract future visitors who benefit from and upvote those  answers.


















My name is Avamander. You can find my nomination post https://arduino.stackexchange.com/election/1#post-43763here.


  
  A question is flagged as "off-topic" because it only peripherally involves an Arduino. For example "How do I get my Arduino to turn on a motor using a transistor?". Should it be closed altogether, migrated to Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange (where they are used to questions about transistors), or left here as a good beginner's Arduino question? Alternatively would you dismiss the flag and let the community handle the question via down-votes or vote-to-close?
  


I know what the intention is by asking this question from me, these questions are interesting to solve as it's hard to say what exactly counts as an Arduino. But in this case, that specific question is Arduino specific. The transistor is an important part, but not what turns motors on by itself. I would dismiss the flags, comment why it's Arduino specific and also mention to use up- and down-votes if people think the question is bad because that's another topic.


  
  A question has a lengthy number of comments under it suggesting various possible solutions to the asked problem. Once the number of comments reaches 20 the system (Community) automatically flags it suggesting that the comments be moved to chat. You move the comments to chat as suggested, and then get a complaint from a user that "valuable information is now hidden away in chat rather than under the question where it should be". How do you respond?
  


If the comments are important to solving the issue I would possibly keep them there because it does cause confusion when some key detail is only in chat. Moving to chat should happen if there's really a lot of discussion  going on maybe not directly related to solving the question. But if I already have moved the discussion I would probably respond that I'll keep that in mind for the next time but this time solve the issue in chat. Chat opening on hover would also help, but that's not in my power to add.


  
  A question is flagged as "not an answer" because it basically only has a link in it. The question is "Where can I find the datasheet for the Atmega328P" and the answer is a link to the datasheet. There is a school of thought that https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answerslink only answers are not good answers. However in this case there isn't really any other way of answering the question. Copying and pasting a huge datasheet into the answer isn't really an option. Also see https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/92505/should-i-flag-answers-which-contain-only-a-link-as-not-an-answerShould I flag answers which contain only a link as “not an answer”?. As a moderator, would you delete the answer, or let it stand?
  


I would close the question, for two reasons, answers are all going to be a link-only (with no good solution) and the datasheet is not hard to find. Google in this case will always have a better result and maintaining such question is just a waste of time.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Amount of answers is irrelevant, one good and one bad doesn't equal 0. I would warn if the amount of arguments gets too high (assuming nothing banal or offensive though), delete after it isn't toned down or when it's flagged by someone else and lastly warn the user(s) privately if it might be needed.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


I use the moderation chat and discuss. Maybe there's something I don't know about the question or the asker.


  
  Regarding why something has to be flagged/closed, do you believe that the actual system (a fixed list of reasons) can be improved or changed for a better one? If you do, how do you propose it could be accomplished?
  


The current system is good, it allows one to add their own reason. One small improvement that could be made is a button in "Reopen" queue to let the user know they're on the right path with their edits, possibly just adds a comment.


  
  What level of knowledge do you demand from users asking questions? Do you believe there's a minimum standard required?
  


I don't demand anything, this is Arduino SE, people have usually just started with electronics and programming. Maybe only knowing how to use Arduino IDE and being literate would suffice.


  
  What would you do if two users start insulting each other about not having sufficient knowledge to post on this site? Assume that both users have flagged each other's comments as rude or abusive.
  


As I am not omniscient, it is quite likely I can't determine and even shouldn't be determining which of the users is right. I would possibly convert the discussion to chat, tell them to discuss calmly (and without insults there if there were any), if that's not possible (knowing user's history), a warning and deletion of the comments.


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  


10k or even 20k reputation is hard to achieve with retention being as low as it is. Main benefit would be for example the ability to retract edits, quickly deleting spam and doing other more dangerous tasks like migration/deletion/conversions.


  
  In your opinion, what do moderators do?
  


As much as needed, as little as possible. A moderator should use moderation tools only for things that are exceptional.

Alternatively would you dismiss the flag and let the community handle the question via down-votes or vote-to-close?
  


Most of these types of questions, although they might also be a good fit for Electrical Engineering, should stay on Arduino as long as they are related directly to Arduino. The transistor question probably would stay since knowing the current and voltage characteristics of an Arduino are essential to answering the question.

On the other hand, if the question was about the thermal characters of a transistor that just happened to be connected to an Arduino, we could consider moving that question to Electrical Engineering. Likewise, if a question asks about the specifics of the syntax for a for loop, we could consider migrating that question to Stack Overflow.


  
  A question has a lengthy number of comments under it suggesting various possible solutions to the asked problem. Once the number of comments reaches 20 the system (Community) automatically flags it suggesting that the comments be moved to chat. You move the comments to chat as suggested, and then get a complaint from a user that "valuable information is now hidden away in chat rather than under the question where it should be". How do you respond?
  


First of all: even with 20-30 comments, there are still a lot of "discussion" comments that don't really add much value. Since I always read the comments before migrating them to chat, I can go back and undelete the comments that are useful for everyone to see.

If someone did become upset at me because of migrating comments to chat, I would consider figuring out a better way to get the information added to the post that they feel is missing. I might also explain to the user the reasoning for why comments are moved from chat, and back up what I say with links to Meta Stack Exchange.


  
  A question is flagged as "not an answer" because it basically only has a link in it. The question is "Where can I find the datasheet for the Atmega328P" and the answer is a link to the datasheet. There is a school of thought that https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8231/are-answers-that-just-contain-links-elsewhere-really-good-answerslink only answers are not good answers.

As a moderator, would you delete the answer, or let it stand?
  


If the question is well phrased and is asking for a link, there's no reason not to answer with a link. I've deleted plenty of link-only-answers that do not provide sufficient explanation, but I pretty much leave library questions alone, although I may comment and ask the poster to edit to include a basic example, etc.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


If they're acting rudely, I will talk to them and tell them that their behavior isn't okay. As with any time a user is rude/mean, it's good to be a little lenient as people who are very knowledgable are often very passionate about their work. But, I will not let a user create an unwelcoming environment just because they are knowledgeable.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Privately contact them. There's often info you may not know about the situation, or the other mod may provide a different viewpoint on the matter. I would hope that any other mod would be open to take constructive criticism and openly talk about matters. 


  
  Regarding why something has to be flagged/closed, do you believe that the actual system (a fixed list of reasons) can be improved or changed for a better one? If you do, how do you propose it could be accomplished?
  


Pretty happy with what we already have here already, but I would be open to change if anyone else had any ideas. Don't have a lot of input here mostly because I, as one of the "pro-tempore" mods for Arduino Stack Exchange, try not to interfere with the natural process of voting to close a post. A mod can close/open a question with a single vote, so I step in when needed, but let the community handle most of the close voting.


  
  What level of knowledge do you demand from users asking questions? Do you believe there's a minimum standard required?
  


Sometimes users need a little more guidance than others, but that's no reason to push someone away. Be nice and patient. If they still aren't getting it, maybe suggest some reading materials/etc. so they can improve their understanding of Arduino. We were all beginners once.


  
  What would you do if two users start insulting each other about not having sufficient knowledge to post on this site? Assume that both users have flagged each other's comments as rude or abusive.
  


Again, it's an expectation that users need to be nice. If they aren't, they need to be talked to. In the case that a stern warning doesn't work for either one or both, a short term suspension might have to be considered, after talking with the other moderators about the issue and trying alternative solutions to resolve any underlying issues and to help neutralize the situation.


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  


Handle flags, settle disputes, be a public figure for the community, and plan and propose new things to help build and expand Arduino Stack Exchange. All of those things are very difficult (if not impossible) to do with 20K rep. A moderator has more of a higher-level role than 20K rep users. Although they are just as important, high rep users work more with closing questions and handling the review queues.


  
  In your opinion, what do moderators do?
  


Be a flight attendant. I know it sounds silly, but it's a fairly good analogy:


Both are forced to put on a smile, even when they don't want to.
Both deal with angry customers/users.
Both are responsible for the general wellbeing of the customers/users.
Both have a lot of obscure, small jobs behind-the-scenes that most people don't know about.
Both hand out free mini bags of peanuts and pretzels.

The nomination phase of our moderator elections ended on Monday 21st. August 2017 at 20:00 UTC.

Note that Stack Exchange has a rule that there must be at least one more candidate than positions available (so there genuinely is an election).

When the nomination period finished we had 3 nominations for 3 positions, and therefore the election could not proceed (the 3 nominated people were not automatically elected).



Update

The nomination period was extended by 7 days to give other people a chance to nominate. It will now close at 20:00 UTC on Monday 28th. August 2017.



If you are one of the many users who post frequently, help clear the review queue, and have an interest in this site, please https://arduino.stackexchange.com/electionnominate as a moderator candidate. Who knows? You might be elected! You would join a small, friendly team of moderators who keep an eye on moderator flags. Moderators have their own chat room for private discussions. There is also a Stack Exchange chat room for moderators only from all sites, where issues can be discussed and resolved.

Moderation is not particularly onerous, unlike the higher-activity sites like Stack Overflow. You may only have to look at a few flags each day.



At the time of editing (Wednesday 23rd. August) we now have 4 nominations, however it would still be helpful to have more nominations. Nominating shows an interest in the site, and gives voters a wider range of choice when voting.

I'm still a little confused by "if I am in a question and I vote to close it" but I take it you mean arriving at the question from outside of a review queue.

If so, then yes, this is correct, and you're right, this is network-wide behavior. The intent of the Custodian, Reviewer and Steward badges is first to increase awareness that the review queues exist, and then encourage people to spend time there/reward those who choose to give back to the community in that particular way. They're not so much about the specific actions one can take from the queues, although there are other badges that cover some of those, like Vox Populi and Copy Editor.

The absence of a badge for closing questions is by design; it would result in many spurious close votes from people just trying to get shiny pieces of virtual metal. Closing questions isn't a primary feature here anyways; it's just something that was invented to assist in keeping things tidy while we work on the real goal: making the Internet a better place through Q&A.

  What should one do in this situation?


Exactly what you have done. First try and sort it out between yourselves, and when that fails, bring it to our attention here. I have locked the answer so it cannot be edited while it gets sorted out.

I guess this falls under the broader heading of how do we, on this site, define "clone". Personally I try not to use it as the word "clone" but couple it with "cheap Chinese" to specifically indicate a device which tries to look like the real thing but is built with some components replaced with cheaper equivalents (CH340G for example). They are as close to the genuine article for new users to be duped into thinking they have a real one when they don't. Yet by the strictest definition they aren't a clone - a clone is an exact copy.

Much of the time the user asking the question doesn't even know that they have a clone / counterfeit / copy / derivative board - they are just asking about using it or getting it going (9 times out of ten it's a CH340G problem, but since they don't know what that is they're looking in the wrong direction anyway and installing FTDI drivers for some reason...). 

The problem with this kind of site is the number of pedants that abound who love to focus on one specific word in an answer that they don't agree with and cause merry hell because of it. It makes them feel important in their small world. The EE site is full of them (which is the main reason I never go there any more).

If the meaning of the answer is clear (as yours is) the exact semantic meaning of specific terms within it is of no importance. Whether you call it a clone, a derivative, or a pile of rancid dog vomit spewed forth by a disreputable fabrication house in the wilds of Malaysia, is of no intrinsic importance.

However, I would say that the editor in question is in the wrong editing your answer like that. Raise his concerns in comments, sure, so you can discuss it and make any changes you both agree with, but acting like a Grammar Nazi? No. Certainly not.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm glad to hear that my approach of going with what I think the question is really talking about (including in "clones" what some would call "derivatives") is reasonable. That's not to say I disagree that distinguishing between the two is a reasonable point to raise. So how does this post go about getting unlocked again at some point?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Once you and Chris have come to an agreement on wording (or Chris has eased off a little), which is best done in chat, the answer can be unlocked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, sounds good. I've created a [chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/66137/) for discussion of this; I'm not clear on how to invite @ChrisStratton to it, but presumably he'll see this comment.


















The war started with a dispute about a single word. Curt said clone and Chris changed it to breadboard. Curt changed it back to clone, then Chris changed it again ... etc.

But the link Curt provided points to a page titled Building an Arduino on a Breadboard. Chris is right in correcting it. The text in a link must match the title in the page.

It's not about clone vs derivative, or some oscure regulation. It's just being consistent.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The way Chris went about it is what irks me. He should have raised it in comments rather than just barging in and changing someone else's post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Majenko. I agree. It's clear that Curt **wants** to use the word *clone*, so trying to edit it to *breadboard* is pointless.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In the context of the original post, an "Arduino" on a breadboard is a type of "clone." Given that "clones," in the sense given in the original post, are what the whole thing is about, I feel pretty strongly that "clone" is the word to be using there. (However, as I've said before, if people strongly believe that we should not be using the word clone for these things, I welcome them posting their own answers discussing this.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@CurtJ.Sampson As I said: *The link text in your answer must match the page title*. This "clone vs breadboard vs derivatives" dispute is irrelevant. You can use whatever word you want. I'm fine with whatever your choose.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Link text must match page title" seems like a silly rule to me. The answer should state what it needs to state as clearly as possible, and not be bound by arbitrary rules like that.


















Look Alterno is correct that the linked site starts with the headline "Building an Arduino on a Breadboard" and is titled "Arduino - Setting up an Arduino on a breadboard" (the title showing on the tab heading for that page).

And indeed the article is about making a breadboard Arduino.

Thanks for the comments in your answer about my article about making a "torch locator" using the Arduino IDE. This wasn't really a breadboard, nor a clone. ;)

I would personally think of a clone as something which is similar to an existing Arduino board (or indeed virtually identical) - hence the word "clone". Something that is pin-compatible I would refer to as Arduino-compatible. And something that uses the IDE and libraries, but has its own hardware design, would be called, ah, I'm not sure. "In the Arduino spirit?" maybe.



As for your actual question, I agree with Majenko. Try to amicably sort it out first, and if that isn't possible flag the answer for moderator attention.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have an Arduino IDE and I wrote *Arduino* C. Whatever run my sketch at the end of the USB cable is an Arduino or *Arduino clone*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh well, from [Cambridge Dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/clone) a clone can be "a computer that operates in a very similar way to the one that it was copied from". Since the keyword here is "operates" and not "looks like" then I will accept your definition. Perhaps you can convince Chris Stratton of that as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Keep in mind, the original post states that, "there may be cases where a clone's features, layout, and/or spec deviate from the norm." If you think a clone can't do that, I think you have an issue with the question, not my answer. While I think that other definitions of "clone" are reasonable (perhaps even desirable), I don't think the one the question author uses is so wrong that answers shouldn't follow it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have perhaps unwisely commented on parts of the underlying problem that were not part of the meta-question. The question was what to do about an edit war, and I think that was answered.


















As long as the OP posts a SSCCE that demonstrates the actual problem then I see no problem with it not being their "live" (NDA) code. However if they post an SSCCE that itself works flawlessly (or is broken in some other way than they state, as is often the case) or a snippet of code that can't itself be verified, then yes they are wasting everyone's time (even their own). They should have seen that the SSCCE they posted didn't exhibit the stated problem, which would have given them some more pointers to where the actual problem is (that's one of the points of doing an SSCCE - it helps to track down the problem to a specific cause before asking for help).

Of course, if they don't understand the concept of the SSCCE then they should first be educated by directing them to http://sscce.org/http://sscce.org/
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should I flag it? Should I vote for closing it? Should you have closed it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Step 1 is to request better code that demonstrates the problem. If that isn't forthcoming (as is often the case) then vote to close it as "unclear what you're asking". I'll probably come along and close it anyway with my question closing hammer. ;)


















You answered the question in good faith, and if you can reproduce a problem in the posted code, and post a solution, then that may help someone some day.

If the OP comes back and says "actually that isn't the real code" then you can request the real code, or say "pffft, in that case I can't help you".

This sort of thing isn't that uncommon. For example, people reduce their sketch size to make it small enough to post, and that frees up enough RAM that the sketch no longer fails due to running out of RAM.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I particularly like the phrasing of "pffft, in that case I can't help you". I may have to get it printed on a T-shirt. :)


















How about voting the question down? That is what voting is for. You could also attach a comment explaining why you did it. That might encourage others to vote it down. With enough downvotes it will be closed.



If you feel strongly enough about it you can flag it for moderator attention, as a very low quality post. Then we can close it.




  If I flag this post ... will you close it?


Let's not double the work moderators have to do by first asking if we will close something if you flag it, and then waiting for a reply, and then flagging it. :) If you feel strongly enough just flag it and see what happens. 

In that particular question's case the question isn't really all that low quality, and in any case you can't flag questions as very low quality (only answers). (Low quality is for gibberish answers, not just ones that don't answer the question).

The design of Stack Exchange is that it should be self-moderating. That is you, the users, can moderate to a large extent by voting to close, or voting a question down (something you can do without a rep penalty). Moderators are there for extreme cases like insults, spam or things that need to be dealt with quickly.

If only one person down-votes a question, it can't be too bad, right? But if 5 down-vote it then it gets closed. (Caveat: I can't find a reference that proves that particular point, but I think enough down-votes will close a question).

See https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-downhttps://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-down

Another alternative for you is to edit the question and improve it.



I am sympathetic to what you are trying to achieve here. A while back I went through old questions and voted-to-close or downvoted them. If we don't do that we end up with a lot of junk questions with no answers. I think what will happen is, if you down-vote, and comment, the question gets bumped to the home page, and then others may look at it and also down-vote it, so you can get community consensus on them. :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I flag this post (https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/45905/how-to-combine-string-variables-to-form-url), will you close it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After some meditation I think that downvoting is the most visible way to mark something as LQP, because voting for closing has no much effect unless four other people agreed.


















What perl1234 meant was, that you should not close question just because they are old and with no answers, because it doesn't mean it's low quality.

Unless they are actually low quality (no effort, too broad, unclear, gimme the codez, etc.), there is nothing wrong with them being left open.

I am not against closing old low quality question, if they are actually bad, just use a valid reason for the close vote.


  
  First post by a newly create user.  
  From user that never returns to Arduino SE for a year or more.  
  No answers, no comments.
  


These by itself are not valid reasons to close it.


  
  No sketch, no schematic, no product identification, poorly written question.
  


This can be closed as unclear.


  
  No effort in finding a solution (Arduino SE, Google).
  


This can be closed as too broad.


  
  Obvious lack of minimal training in electricity and/or programming.
  


This can be closed as unclear or too broad, depending if he can't explain what he wants or he expect from us too much.


  
  Demands for complete solution (sketch and/or schematic).
  


This can be closed as too broad.



You also seem to have been a little bit sloppy in seeing what is a question without an answer.
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/q/24470This question had an answer by OP edited into the question. I edited that one out of the question and into an answer.
And https://arduino.stackexchange.com/q/31365this question doesn't look like low quality to me. The problem could be replicated with the provided code (assuming it actually does what he says) and a solution could be posted.

Also, if you want to discourage low quality questions, you should not answer them. If you give them what they want, they might come back with another low quality question, even if their previous question was closed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not saying that first post is LQP. I'm saying that LQP are generally the first post by a new user. I use those as signal of a possible LQP.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You said https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/24470/slice-byte-stream-into-bit-pieces has one answer, but you added that yesterday, after my post. And it's a pure programming question (bit manipulation), totally unrelated to Arduino. And the answer is only applicable to that particular case, and not very useful for anyone else. And the OP's last visit is Jan 2017, which doesn't signal a great interes in Arduiino.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You don't think https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/31365/can-i-get-my-rgbw-neopixel-strip-to-loop-perfectly-by-adjusting-rainbowfade2whit is LQP. I respect your opinion, but the fact is that nobody found valuable enough to answer it, and it's adding nothing to Arduino SE:


















Just answer for the future visitor that did an internet search for the question and upvote any good answers already on the question.

A large part of SE philosophy is to help the future visitor as much as the current asker.

How do we close it if it was already answered?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't need to be "closed", when there is a upvoted answer the system will consider it answered in all but name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unfortunately, many of these are weak questions where only poor answers not deserving upvotes are likely to be posted.  Often the question itself must be closed as it is either unclear or not a fit for the Stack Exchange model.


















I will talk for myself: You have a Windows problem, not an Arduino problem.

I'm a volunteer. I'm here just for the fun, to learn from others and give a piece of advice when I can. I work in problems that looks interesting, demanding, challenging.

Solving Windows problems is the definition of unfunny.

I dropped Windows many years ago and switched to Linux. Best decision.

Windows is fantastic if you want to write a letter on behalf of your boss.



















https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ethernet-sheildethernet-sheild: Misspelled. It should be renamed to ethernet-shield since there is no existing tag of that name.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some tags that need fixingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You are drastically misrepresenting the linked question about board naming - in addition to the fact that nothing was "decided" the arguments there apply only to *some* of the boards which officially have Arduino as the leading part of their name.  But there is no such thing as an Arduino-Edison (or an arduino-esp8266 or an arduino-teensy-3.2, etc).  Since questions that aren't about Arduino are off-topic, there's no need to invent fake names to emphasize in the tag that an arduino approach is being used - if it isn't, the question gets closed as off topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Chris, it's listed on the [Arduino products page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelEdison) so in a sense it is associated with Arduino. However it is "certified" rather than being an Arduino product. The arguments listed in the link in the question about not prepending Arduino (eg. arduino-robot) would seem to apply here as well. Edison on its own has other meanings.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In case it's not obvious, I'm hoping to get other opinions. So far we have one for and one against. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2370/is-an-esp8266-running-arduino-code-question-allowedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I only would suggest that the edison tag be consistent with galileo, however that is to be done. intel-edison would be another option. I really don't have a strong opinion on the topic. I actually didn't realize that, unlike the 101, those boards weren't really branded as Arduino even though they are Arduino certified. My original motivation for this post was to get the ethernet-sheild spelling fixed but I thought I might as well review all the tags while I was at it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally I don't care either way what is done with the edison tag. It can be deleted for all I care, since the edison itself has been discontinued and only three people ever bought them anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`intel-edison` is something that used to exist.  `arduino-edison` is not - the product was the Intel Edison *for* Arduino.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm happy with changing [tag:edison] to `intel-edison` and changing [tag:arduino-galileo] to `intel-galileo`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the `intel-edison` and `intel-galileo` suggestion above.


















Questions

Saying things like "Hi!" or "thanks in advance for answering" are frowned-upon, partly because they just clutter up the question. Also it's a bit cheeky in a question to thank people for an answer, it sounds like you are putting pressure on them to answer.

You will probably find some higher-reputation users removing such notes from questions, although I think if you are going to edit a question, you should be making more improvements than just removing "Thanks" from the end of it.

As https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/17886/297719Jeff Atwood noted there are better ways of thanking people for their answer like:


Voting up good answers
Accepting the best one
Helping the person who answered you by answering one of their questions if practical
"Pay it forward" by helpfully answering someone else's question


Answers

I'm not sure why you would put "thanks" in an answer. Who are you thanking? However again,  it just adds to the clutter to do it.

Comments

You are not supposed to make a comment to simply say "Thanks!". A more appropriate response is one of the ones above. The person answering will notice the reputation boost from voting up their answer, and certainly if you accept the answer it is clear who did the accepting.

However if you have something useful to say in a comment, then adding in a "thank you" won't do any harm. For example:


  Thanks for that great answer. I found that if I increased the sampling rate it worked even better.


In that case you are contributing to the answer with your technical note, and slipping in a "thank you" at the same time.

This site graduated last year, and so as we're rounding out to the end of our first month of the new year, we'll be starting Community Promotion Ads for this site!

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


the site's twitter account
interesting stories and creations with Arduino that folks have published
helpful resources for folks wanting to work with Arduino
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2517here.

The quoted uninformative message is a severe site design error.


















It's supposed to make you aware that you have been flagging incorrectly and that way teach you what is considered a good flag and what isn't.

There is no real actions to take on the website except to flag better.

On the mod interface you're marked `NOT banned from flagging / Warned when flagging`.


















You can actually view a list of your flags and how they were handled if you would like to review. If you go to your user profile on the Activity tab, you can click on the XX Helpful Flags and you get a list of all of your flags.

I don't know exactly how the algorithm for warning works, as roughly 90% of your flags were deemed "helpful." If you're worried about it, look at your declined posts to look for a pattern (in your case there does seem to be a specific type of flag).

Also, when looking at your flag history, please note that Disputed is not Declined. Here's what it means: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/95277/190823https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/95277/190823

The name is confusing, but a flag is marked "disputed" when it's ambiguous how a moderation responded to it. This post explains it: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/95277/190823b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think all of this is oscure on purpose, to get you spend time here collecting bits of information here and there, like trying to reconstruct the rules of a game long time forgotten.

How do I ask a good question about the Arduino?

We’d love to help you. To improve your chances of getting an answer, here are some tips:



https://arduino.stackexchange.com/searchSearch and research

Have you thoroughly https://arduino.stackexchange.com/searchsearched for an answer before asking your question? Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs. This demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer!

If you ask something like how to connect neopixels to arduino and we know that https://www.google.com/Google has 77,000 hits for that question, we won't be very interested, unless you explain how your problem differs from the usual ones. Include a couple of links from pages that you have researched, to show that you have done some homework, and then describe your problem.



Be on topic

On topic:


Specific questions about Arduino boards, code, and the Arduino IDE. Feel free to ask about anything related to Arduino.
Questions about other IDEs, clones/counterfeits/derivatives, and other coding languages for Arduino. Feel free to ask about any language for coding Arduino.
Board recommendations. Make sure to include detailed information about the project you are doing and your requirements. If your question is too vague, it may be put on hold.
Library recommendations. Make sure to include detailed information about the requirements. If your question is too vague, it may be put on hold.
Code review: Use the tag project-critique for advice on how to improve your code/project.


Off topic:


General Coding: If your question is about coding not related to Arduino, try https://stackoverflow.com/Stack Overflow


If the solution would be the same with or without Arduino, then it's usually a general coding question.

General Electronics: If your question is about making electronics or other electricity questions not related to Arduino, try https://electronics.stackexchange.com/Electrical Engineering.


If knowledge of Arduino would improve a question, it's on topic. Otherwise, it might not be a great fit for our site.





Make a meaningful title

Try to summarize your problem with a helpful and informative subject line. Helpful subjects draw in people who might know the answer. Unhelpful ones are likely to be skipped.

Examples of unhelpful subject lines:


Noob here, help needed
Help me, quickly!
Got error
Lost, help me
Problem with my circuit
No idea what I am doing


Good subject lines might be:


Problem interfacing 24LC256 EEPROM to Arduino Uno using I2C
LED flashes twice as quickly as expected
How can I work out how many Neopixels (WS2812 LEDs) are in a string?




Post in proper sentences

This is a forum you are using, not a mobile phone.

As a courtesy to the people you are hoping to have help you, type complete sentences. That is:


Start with a capital letter.
Spell words properly.
Finish with a period (full-stop). (Just the one, thanks!)
Break longer posts into paragraphs, and not have a "wall of text" hitting the reader.




Post your code, formatted correctly

Here is the "blink" sketch, copied and pasted into a post:


  void setup() {
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  }
  void loop() {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(1000);              // wait for a second
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  }


Pretty hard to read, isn't it? Now just select all the code, and press Ctrl+K (think of the word "Kode"). That formats it nicely like this:

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}


Basically all it has done is indent everything by 4 spaces.

You can force the syntax-colouring you see above by putting this before the code:

<!-- language: lang-c++ -->


Format your code in the IDE before posting

In the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) format your code by pressing Ctrl+T before posting it here. The auto-format indents code properly so you can see what code is under an if, for example.

Properly formatted code helps to work out logic errors, for example if you accidentally have an extra semicolon which shouldn't be there.

Do not post screen-shots or photos of your code

Do not take a screenshot of your code, or photograph it with your phone. Copy and paste the code as text and put it into your question as described above. A screenshot or photograph can't be copied and pasted into replies, nor can we copy and paste the code into the IDE and test it ourselves on your behalf.



Post a Minimal, Complete and Verifiable Example

To help us to reproduce the problem, post a https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcveMinimal, Complete and Verifiable Example that demonstrates the problem. This may not always be possible, but in many cases (for example, displaying numbers on a 7-segment LED display) it is very practical. This helps separate out the problem (not being able to display) from the non-problem (how you calculate those numbers).



Provide links to any libraries used

Many libraries have variants (for example, keypad libraries, SD card libraries, LCD display libraries). To help reproduce (and understand) your problem provide a link to the exact library you are using.



If the question mentions hardware, be specific

Don't just say "I have a temperature sensor connected to my Arduino".


Say which sensor (part number)
Give a link to the datasheet which describes the part or the board
Say where you got if from (eg. Adafruit, Sparkfun, eBay) with a link to the specific page where it appears
Say which Arduino (eg. Arduino Uno)




Include a photo of your set-up

If the issue sounds like a hardware issue, take a clear, in-focus picture of your hardware. The photo should clearly indicate which wires go where. Preferably use a different colour for each wire like in this picture:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/d43yx.png



Include a schematic

Many projects involve extra hardware (switches, LEDs, motors, other parts). Draw or make a schematic showing how they are connected together. Do not use Fritzing which is not the same as a schematic and often difficult to read. You can get free software which draws schematics from https://www.expresspcb.com/Express PCB (you need the ExpressSCH program). This runs under Windows. You can also use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAGLE_(program)Eagle although the learning curve may be greater with that. As a last resort sketch out your schematic with pencil and paper and scan or photograph it, and include that.

Example of ExpressSCH schematic:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/QWdzV.png



Be clear what the question is

A good question states:


What you expected to happen; and
What actually happened


For example, "I expected the LED to flash every second" (the expectation) "but it doesn't flash / flashes every 5 seconds / is always on / is always off".


Avoid saying "it doesn't work". What doesn't work?
Distinguish between:


Compiler errors (that is, you can't even compile the program)
Uploading errors (it compiles, but doesn't upload to the board)
Run-time errors (it compiles and uploads, but does something you don't expect it to)





Tips for getting the most out of your post


Mention which Arduino you have. Is it a Uno? Leonardo? Due? Mini? Mega? The problem might be specific to a certain model.
Describe your problem in detail.
If it relates to an electronics part (chip or board), give the exact part number and preferably a link to the data sheet.
Describe how you have connected things like switches. Are they wired to ground? Or +5V? Are there pull-up or pull-down resistors? Post a circuit if there is doubt.
Post a complete sketch (program code)! If you don't you waste time while people ask you to do that. However, with coding problems, if possible post a https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcveMinimal, Complete and Verifiable Example that demonstrates the problem - not hundreds of lines of code. If the problem goes away in the minimal sketch, it wasn't where you thought it was.
Copy and paste code. Don't retype "from memory" on your mobile phone, in the train.
If you get an error, post the error (copy and paste). Not just "I got an error".
If you have debugging information in your sketch, post your debugging displays.
If you are using a library that does not come with the IDE (in other words, you downloaded it from somewhere) please post a link to this library.
Describe what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. Not just "it doesn't work".
If possible, describe what you are really trying to do, not what you think might work. For example "I am trying to turn on an aquarium heater and pump at the same time", not "how do I break out of an interrupt?".
Try to narrow down the problem, whether coding or electronic. Don't confuse us and yourself by trying to do everything at once. For example, if you are having problems reading a sensor, make up a simple test case, that tests that sensor (both electrically and in code).
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/be-niceBe nice - people are trying to help you here. If you are asked for more information, provide it calmly. Resist the urge to say something is "obviously" the case, or "I already mentioned that".




Don't cross-post!

Do not cross-post the same question on different Stack Exchange sites. See http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64068/Is cross-posting a question on multiple Stack Exchange sites permitted if the question is on-topic for each site?. Work out which site is the best fit for your question (sometimes this can be a bit hard) and stick to one site.

You might consider:


https://arduino.stackexchange.com/Arduino Stack Exchange (here)
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange - if the question is largely about electronics, and not really about the Arduino
https://stackoverflow.com/Stack Overflow - if the question is largely about programming in general, and the fact that the programming is on the Arduino is incidental to the question (for example, a question about C++ classes)
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange - if the question is about the Raspberry Pi
https://robotics.stackexchange.com/Robotics Stack Exchange - if the question is more about robotics than the Arduino


If you have asked on another site (like the http://forum.arduino.cc/Arduino Forum) it is polite to mention that you have also asked there (post a link to the question). Some people here are members of Arduino Forum as well as Arduino Stack Exchange, and rather than helping you more if you post on both sites, may ignore both questions.



Don't double-post!

If you haven't got an answer in a couple of days, do not post the same question again. Regular users will soon spot that and flag your reposted question for deletion.

You can https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/bountyadd a bounty to a question if you in a hurry for it to be answered. However you will need 50 reputation to do that.

Another thing you can do to help get a question answered is review your question. Have you followed the suggestions above? Maybe more details, links to parts, schematics, images, code, and so on, would help other people work out what the problem is, and post an answer.



Other resources


See Jon Skeet's post: https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/Writing the perfect question As Jon says, imagine you are trying to answer your own question.


  Once you’ve finished writing your question, read it through. Imagine you were coming to it fresh, with no context other than what’s on the screen. Does it make sense? Is it clear what’s being asked? Is it easy to read and understand?

Is it a https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/334822/how-do-i-ask-and-answer-homework-questionshomework question. That can be OK, so don't try to hide it (we can usually tell, when people say something like "my task is to do X").

If you admit it is homework we can still try to help you, but also try to help you to learn the underlying concepts. In other words, don't expect an answer that you just type up and hand in, but expect people to help you to help yourself with the issue.
If you aren't sure of some procedural issue (for example, you can't post a lot of images) you can ask on the https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/Meta Arduino Site which is there for asking about how the site itself works.

How to write a good answer

Some new users on Stack Exchange may find the system of flagging, voting and commenting a bit difficult to follow, or frustrating, even.

This post is intended as a guide to writing a good answer.

A good answer


Will help the OP (Original Poster - the person who asked the question)
May be https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/accepted-answeraccepted by the OP, thus giving a +15 reputation bonus
May be up-voted by multiple people, each up-vote giving a +10 reputation bonus
May attract positive or helpful comments under the answer
Will help other people in the future (people with a similar question)
As your https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputationreputation increases your https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privilegesprivileges on the site will increase


A bad answer


May attract down-votes, each down-vote deducting 2 reputation points from the person who made the answer
A lot of down-votes may cause the question to be automatically closed
May be flagged for moderator attention, possibly leading to its deletion
Too many negative flags (agreed to by the moderators) may lead to a temporary suspension of privileges
May attract negative comments




This is not a forum

Stack Exchange has a different model to most forums. On a forum (for example http://forum.arduino.cc/The Arduino Forum) answers are likely to build on previous answers, a bit like this:


  Q. I've connected my LED to the Arduino output pin and earth, and set that pin to OUTPUT and HIGH. However the LED does not light up. Why is that?
  
  John: You may have it in backwards.
  
  Emma: You also need a current-limiting resistor.
  
  James: Good idea! 220 ohms would be about right.
  
  Olivia: Make sure you have the pin set to OUTPUT.
  
  Ethan: See http://www.thebox.myzen.co.uk/Tutorial/LEDs.htmlthis web page
  
  Sophia: What colour LED is it?


In a forum this is perfectly reasonable, and the overall answer is an amalgamation of each response. However here most of those answers would be down-voted or flagged as too short, "not an answer", or "link-only".

If you are used to forums, you may be aggrieved that a response that was perfectly acceptable on a forum gets down-votes, negative comments, or is possibly deleted entirely.

Answers should stand alone

Answers on Stack Exchange should stand on their own, and not rely upon snippets of information from other answers, or comments.

What you need to do is take the time to make a comprehensive reply that will not only help the OP today, but stand as a beacon of helpfulness for people in the next ten years! Something like this:



Example answer

LEDs are polarized, and thus have to be fitted the correct way around. If you have a LED tester or multimeter you can usually work it out by measuring the LED. There are some visual clues, however. If the leads haven't been cut the longer one is the positive lead (anode):

https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPEsO.jpg

Also, the negative lead (cathode) will have a small notch cut out of the plastic (viewed from below) like this:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/LqV9E.png

LEDs need to be protected from too much current. If you connect an LED directly across a battery or Arduino output pins, the high current through the LED will damage both the LED and the Arduino. You need to limit current, typically to around 20 mA. This is often done with a resistor in series, like this:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/31s3R.jpg

Note that the part of the LED symbol with the bar is the negative side (cathode). The 220 ohm resistor will limit the current to around 15 mA for a red LED.

You can visit a http://led.linear1.org/1led.wizLED calculator site. Example of the calculations:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/jhObw.png

The forward voltage varies depending on the colour of the LED, and typical ones (from that site) are:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDiEM.png

You can do the calculations yourself by considering that with a forward voltage drop of 2V for a red LED, then there must be a 3V drop over the resistor. Using Ohm's Law:

R = V / I
R = 3 / 0.015
R = 200


The closest standard value is 220 so we use 220 ohms here. Re-arranging the formula we can work out the exact current:

I = V / R
I = 3 / 220
I = 0.014


Thus this arrangement will actually draw 14 mA from the output pin which is in spec for an Arduino output pin.

Example code

const byte ledPin = 5;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}

The example answer above illustrates:


Images of parts to make clear which terminal is which
A schematic of the connections
Example code
An explanation of why a certain resistor value was used
Some off-site references for more reading




Answers should not only contain links to other sites

Links can, and probably will, go "link dead" over time. Thus an answer of "see www.xyz.com" which may be helpful today will be useless when "xyz.com" becomes defunct. Preferably summarize, paraphrase, or re-state what the linked site says. Then include the link, if necessary, as "further information". Of course, don't claim the other person's work as your own, so you could say something like "As John Smith says at xyz.com, blah blah blah ...".



Comments on answers

Please feel free to comment on someone's answer if you think something is unclear, or wrong. If you see an obvious typo, and you have enough reputation to do so, you can edit the answer to fix up the problem. However do not change the original intent of the answer.



Make another answer

If you see an answer that you believe isn't the greatest, or there is a better way of doing things, then feel free to post a different answer that explains the situation better. Stack Exchange is designed for this to happen, so that the best answer gets the most votes and "floats" to the top of the answer pool.



If you like an answer, vote for it!

If you see a good answer, vote it up. This helps others (like the OP) know that other people agree with the answer. It also helps the person making the answer get more reputation.



Answers are NOT for:


Asking another question - start your own question for that.
A "me too!" answer - that is, saying you have the same problem as in the question, and asking if anyone solved it.
To ask for more information about the question - use a comment for that if you have enough reputation. If not, answer some other questions until you have built up enough reputation to make comments (currently 50 reputation).
For the OP to add additional information, like schematics, code, photos, explanations. Edit the question to do that.
To comment on another answer - use a comment under the answer to do that.

A "question" such as "My LED doesn't light up." is not only too broad, **it is not even a question**,  and probably not even on topic here.  Such a posting either gets closed, or comments are used to request clarification.  Jumping right in and **responding to that non-question with a full treatise on LEDs is not appropriate.**  Frankly the comments you use as a negative example are closer to being appropriate initial responses to the non-question - yes, even the color one (given forward voltages).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's unique about Stack Exchange is that it is not only not a discussion forum, it is not a textbook or tutorial site either.  Questions must be specific, and while answers may go beyond the question, they need to be a specific response to an actual question which has been asked, not a general response triggered by someone expressing non-specific interest in an area of technology.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You make some valid points, but I think the problem here is that the question was a bit vague. I can reword the question to be more of the sort of question that deserves a lengthy answer. I see quite a few answers along the lines of "go look that up on the Internet" which frankly I don't think helps anyone. I wasn't using the "what colour is it?" as a negative example, but as an example of the sort of things you expect on a forum.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Take a look at [It’s OK to Ask and Answer Your Own Questions](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/07/01/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/). There Jeff Atwood makes it clear that it is OK to use Stack Exchange to provide some sort of tutorial (even if you have to make up your own question so you can answer it). Arguably, if I ask a question and then answer it, it isn't a *genuine* question because I already know the answer.


















See https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/close-questionsHelp Center > Privileges > Cast close and reopen votes
It's the result of "close" votes being cast.

It takes 5 close votes to reach the closing threshold ...
Close votes age away harmlessly if the threshold is not reach after a number of days. ...
Once a question has been closed, it will no longer accept new answers and the words [on hold] will be appended to the title. After 5 days, if the question remains closed, the word [closed] will instead be appended to the title.

So "on hold" really means "this is going to be marked closed soon, unless you can convince people to re-open it". However it is still actually closed.


... any user with the "protect questions" privilege can put question on hold ...

No, that's different. I've protected a couple of questions which were intended as reference questions, when people were starting to "answer" with their own problems.
Right now, users with 500+ rep will have the "cast close and reopen votes" privilege, which is what is needed for voting to close.

Moderators can also lock questions and answers, like https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/5043289this rather amusing one in order to prevent people altering it.

" It seems like the same parameters are used across  all Stack Exchange sites.


















I frequently see this, on older questions. Where do they end up?  If I add anything to them, is the OP likely to see it?

EDIT - okay, so it ends up at the top page in that 'forum' area, looking like an active question, but is not really.

  is the OP likely to see it?


Possibly not. I've seen quite old questions bumped, and the OP may have moved on. They will probably get an email notification however. Still, questions here are not just for the OP, and if you can give a good answer it may help someone else in the future.

These questions seem to go on getting bumped back to the top every so often, forever.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can always up-vote the answer(s) if it/they appears to be a good attempt to answer the question. In particular, if the OP doesn't say "that didn't work" you might default to assuming it worked.


















This is more than likely an obvious question but I would still like to confirm my suspicion or perhaps I'm completely wrong and there could be something I'm ignorant about the processes behind StackExchange operations.

Cut to the chase, why isn't a logo or banner for this website? I know we're out of the beta stage but every SE branch out there that is not a beta has their own website (okay, I might have some confirmation bias but you know what I mean, right?). Is it due to the fact of possible copyright infringement if had their logo or pictures of their products on this website? I'm assuming that this place is an unofficial Arduino supported website so perhaps that could explain the lack of branding for this website. The main reason why I ask is to fulfill my own curiosity. I'm not suggesting a call for action or anything.

I mean, even Raspberry Pi SE has something for their website and they don't have the company logo for what I presume the same reason.

Really the fact that it's an online simulation is irrelevant. The issue in question was with your code, and it would be the same on a real Arduino (lack of pullup / pulldown resistor on the input, or no INPUT_PULLUP set).

In this situation the question is not really about TinkerCAD - it's about your code or circuit. 

However if there was something that worked on a real Arduino but not on TinkerCAD, you'd certainly be better asking about it at TinkerCAD.

Format your code in the Arduino IDE (or in whatever code-entry editor you are using). In the Arduino IDE, it's the 'Tools | Autoformat' menu item.
Copy/paste your code into Arduino Stack Exchange's question or answer text-entry box. (If you're trying to show code in a comment, forget about formatting. Comment boxes strip all the indenting and newlines out of it. The best you can do in a comment is enclose it in back-ticks: `` to give it a gray background).
Select the entire block of code and click the '{}' symbol in the text-entry box's header. That will indent your code so the site will recognize it as code and keep its formatting.

I don't post much here because I stopped fooling around with Arduino about the time this SE was getting off the ground, so I posted my https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/56767/what-are-the-benefits-or-advantages-of-arduino-cli?noredirect=1#comment120498_56767first question today.  And a user with lots of rep answered it, then an hour later made a snarky comment (but obviously obvious), and at some point unilaterally closed the question (aka "put on hold"), presumably because he received a downvote from someone, possibly thinking it was from me (making this retaliation).

Not sure how things work here on this SE, but that sounds like shenanigans in general, as well as on other SEs.

Interestingly (randomly?), the https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2361/congratulations-to-majenko-on-reaching-20k-rep4th suggested question was a congratulations to the user to reach a milestone reputation. 

It's obvious from his terse messages/comments/replies that he doesn't like to explain himself, making a point to be as succinct as possible, even to the detriment of communication.

Is there something actually wrong with this question, are shenanigans afoot, or is something else going on here?  There were several other similar types questions offered in the suggested questions dialog as I wrote the question, and it should be relatively easy for proponents of this new feature to enumerate some of the benefits of it.

It's garnering opinions, asking, effectively, "what is your opinion on this thing? What's the point of it?". If you can't see the point if it, then the point is not relevant to you - so why do you care?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions that ask for opinions are not welcome on the site - hence the closure.  I often answer a question and then close it, because even questions that don't belong on the site deserve an answer sometimes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the suggested questions are generated on base of your question. and you mentioned reputationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The top 3 results for a search of "benefit" are the same kind of question that I asked.  FYI, if y'all are gonna be like Stack Overflow, I'm not going to hang around.  I don't hang out over there because it's obvious they hate questions.  This is approaching the SO gordian knot of "Look at our top voted questions to understand what kinds of questions are appropriate here" && "Highly voted questions are not an indicator of valid questions [because we've changed what questions are valid over time]".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Back to the topic of this question: your brevity and circular logic aren't explaining what you're trying to say.  Obviously, if I don't immediately appreciate the apparent value of something, I probably don't understand it's utility.  That's why I'm asking people who do know why this thing is useful.  Otherwise, if it was so trivially easy to appreciate the utikity of something, I could ask Siri/Cortana/Alexa/Jeeves.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, we hate questions. We don't hate problems though. Bring us your problems and we will try to solve them - that is what we are here for. What the SO sites are *not* are general discussion forums.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you had a need for the CLI you would immediately know the benefits of the CLI. Since you don't immediately know the benefits of the CLI you obviously have no need for the CLI, and knowing the benefits would be of no interest to you since you have no need for those benefits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The CLI is a niche facility. It is only of interest to the people who populate that niche, and those people, by virtue of being in that niche, already know the benefits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem with your overgeneralization is that it applies to all features and all questions, thereby cascading the entire reason for a Q&A site out of existence, preempting not only Q&A sites or forums, but communication as a whole.


















Majenko is elected moderator. I repeat - elected. Users of Arduino SE trust him. The reputation points are well-earned with his extensive knowledge of Arduino, microcontrollers and electronics. So your accusations are wrong. Perhaps he should not put your question on hold, but it is not shenanigans.

  Interestingly (randomly?), the 4th suggested question was a congratulations to the user to reach a milestone reputation.


That post is over two years old. I was congratulating Majenko for reaching a high-reputation milestone.

I can't explain how that particular question got related to yours, there doesn't seem to be any connection.




  So, what you're saying is that someone(s) elected him king and now he can do no wrong?


There are processes in place for dealing with rogue moderators, however I think that in this particular case there is nothing particularly insulting or unfriendly in Majenko's response.

All users, particularly moderators, are expected to abide by the https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/conductStack Exchange Code of Conduct.

Moderators must abide by https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/site-moderatorsadditional restrictions to their behaviour.



To be honest, I've had questions in other parts of Stack Exchange closed by moderators, to my annoyance. :) So, it can happen to anyone (I'm a moderator here).

The more vague the question is, the more likely it is to be closed, as a general rule.

I created an answer with a picture


















I have no idea why it was only showing one option. It should have had "Spam - Exists only to promote a product or service, does not disclose the author's affiliation." as the first option in the list.  Choosing this option automatically (after something like 6 flags) deletes the question.

Maybe you were too late and it was already flagged enough times as spam and was actually deleted already.  Spam disappears almost immediately it arrives on these sites. In general, by the time you see it, it's already gone. If it hasn't, then the option of flagging as spam should be there.

If it isn't there, then I would guess you don't need to flag it - you're too late to make any difference.

Note: We don't usually need to delete spam. The system does it for us. By telling us manually about spam by flagging it for our attention (even though it may have not given you any other options?) it's just causing us more work that we don't need. 

If you have a problem with how the system itself works then you should raise a question on meta.stackexchange.com as we here have no control over (nor much knowledge of) how the system works internally. We just moderate.

This particular "question" was in the review queue, so not that old.  It's good to have the explanation about spam.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MichaelT "*Maybe you were too late and it was already flagged enough times as spam and was actually deleted already.*" I believe this is the reason. Deleted posts only show a sole "mod flag". So if you encounter this, consider refreshing the page to check the post status.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is a "smoke detector" bot which informs subscribed users when it thinks it detects a spam post. They don't have to be moderators. Enough users who react to such messages are likely to cause the spam to be flagged, and then deleted, almost immediately.


















I've never requested a new tag before.

I have https://arduino.stackexchange.com/q/60033/42469a question about the https://create.arduino.cc/editorArduino Create site but there's no tag for it yet.

It's New Year's Day in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_TimeStack Exchange land...
A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
-- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation

While there certainly are https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/Moderators here, a significant amount of the moderation is done by ordinary people, using the privileges
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.
As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together.
To that end, here is how the moderation done here on Arduino breaks down by activity over the past 12 months:

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e52018: a year in moderationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One may ask: "Why do we even need moderators?". Well, the answer is simple: [people need someone to complain to](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/significant-results/201706/the-three-types-complaining).  Without someone to complain to they will just explode, and that would get messy.


















I was watching a rather cheesy disaster movie this evening (a terrible film - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1887703/Collision Earth - very formulaic, I could write the script blindfold) and spotted an Arduino (well, some red Arduino Uno clone, probably R2 looking at the location of the reset button) in one of the props.  It forms, supposedly, part of the communication system of a space ship...

https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Dctg.png

Does anyone else know of any instances of an Arduino or an Arduino Clone being used as a prop in a movie?



Oh, and while kind of on the subject, I recognise this PCB from somewhere. It's from the same film, but I know the PCB. They're normally in a rack of loads of them (in the film they are, too, but backwards). I swear I've seen it before somewhere from some teardown maybe.  Anyone have any hints?

2019 is here! And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of Community Promotion Ads! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


the site's twitter account
interesting stories and creations with Arduino that folks have published
helpful resources for folks wanting to work with Arduino
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2561here.

Greetings which I hope make it past the remove greetings bot ;)   Yes, this is much the same post as the one I just put up at IoT.SE Meta, almost.

I added the Arduino.SE community promotion ad used in years past at https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/ to the new https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2134/community-promotion-ads-2019(2019) selection page there; they must be renewed annually.

That one is totally fine, but if anyone thinks they have a better one, post it here and I will replace it (rather than having competing ads for the same site).  Be sure you understand the requirements for the image first, they are in the question on the RPi Meta page linked above.

Also, if you are a voting member at RPi.SE, please upvote the ad, since they must reach a threshold in order to appear. The specific "answer" https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2136/5538is here.

There's already a banner at the top.  Anyway, it is totally normative practice to do both (promote the local exchange as well as related ones).  In fact, it's totally normal to promote non-SE sites if enough people vote the ad as appropriate.  E.g., Rpi has usually had a link to the foundation's github page, on U&L you'll find community ads for various linux distros, etc.  The SO version is even explicitly about ads for open source software: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/379273/open-source-advertising-1h-2019b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the clarification.

I've recently joined Arduino.SE but am a 7K+ reputation member of both SO and U&L.

Every community has its different mores, and I'm guessing that I've not yet grokked this one's.

My https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/53509/tom-hale?tab=reputationreputation page shows -12 reputation over the last 6 days on both questions and answers.

Can someone explain what I may be missing? Or have I just had a bad run of luck?

Bad luck, mainly.  Answers that don't quite pertain to the question, questions that you answer yourself where the question has been asked before, or questions that aren't on topic (note: we have questions on Arduino hardware and other systems that use the Arduino API. Generic microcontroller hardware questions, even if they are for a microcontroller that happens to be used on an Arduino, are not really our sphere).

We are a fairly narrow site. For more general questions on electronics and microcontrollers the Electrical Engineering SE is usually a better fit.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm, the thing is that I never asked a "generic microcontroller question". All the questions / answers pertained to Leonardo's chip.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could you elaborate on the answer(s) which don't quite pertain to the question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is one where the OP asks where *on his hard drive* some files are. You point him to Github. While the files *are* available there, that's not what the OP asked. Maybe he wants to modify the files on his hard drive or something. So people see that answer as wrong, since it's not answering the question asked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the chip one, you're asking about the chip and the datasheet. That's more generic than about the Leonardo. That's microcontroller. That's EE, not Arduino. If the question had been about the Leonardo as a whole then that's fine. Personally I have nothing against that kind of question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However, the simple answer to any question like that (which is probably why it got closed / downvoted) is "From the manufacturer of the chip".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The datasheet also describes registers which (correct me if I'm wrong) would fall under Arduino.  I'm glad to learn the manufacturer is now Microchip, which was non-obvious given how generic the result is when googling `ATmega`.


















This site doesn't tend to up or down-vote much which therefore skews the votes you do get. As an example, I got 77 votes for https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/88504/43247an answer on Cooking Stack Exchange where I basically posted a photo of a kitchen strainer which took me a couple of minutes to take. On the other hand, I've spent hours on posts which only got a handful of votes. For example https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/22237/10794this one about interrupts which only got 11 upvotes (maybe I didn't spend hours on that particular one, but I still get a very low upvote rate).

I had down-votes when I initially joined this site, and now I am a moderator. I suggest you ignore the implied criticism and just do your best to post interesting questions, and also interesting answers and let your work speak for itself.

To a certain extent people will downvote a question if it looks like you haven't tried all that hard to research before posting, or if there is a similar question already with an answer. I'm not saying this applies in your case, but that tends to be what happens.

Links can go down, so putting a link in an answer, or a comment, doesn't really help if that happens.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*11 upvotes* that's 15 now, does your meta post now qualify as click bait?


















Mods - I'm writing this in Meta because the site is limiting me from writing out my full request. Please re-review my answer to this question.: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/62205/first-arduino-uno-immediate-problems/62206?noredirect=1#comment133601_62206First Arduino Uno - Immediate Problems

A mod wrote "It is a question eliciting further information." 
Actually, it is a full answer. I pointed out some missing information that seemed - and was, in fact - relevant, AND I went on to offer the correct solution, as stated by the OP!: to load the missing drivers, which I had also located. I believe this is an/the appropriate answer. So did the OP as he stated in a followup comment. With the OP stating it solved his problem, how is this not an answer?! 

You've asked me to review my answer, my flag, and the moderators' denial, and I have done so. Now I am asking you - several of you, please - to review all of the foregoing, and tell me why an answer, accepted in writing by the OP - still deserves to be demoted. 

I am asking you restore restore my answer. It deserves a place next to other answers, and it/I deserves an opportunity to be upvoted and/or selected, just as does any other answer that solves a problem does.

On a site with the standing of Stack Exchange, please don't tell me that moderation is considered mistake-proof, is final, and may not be peer-reviewed. Without any intention of blowing my own horn, I ask you to review the all-time standings; I didn't just wander in here yesterday. Your users - my peers - apparently feel that I add some value here. In this case, the OP has stated so, too. 

I believe this disagreement deserves an honest and fair review by both sides. I have thoroughly reviewed my contribution and I stand by it for all of the foregoing reasons. I am asking for a similar honest and thorough review of the facts by the moderation team.

Is it allowed to ask a question if you've already have an solution/answer?

This could be done to get alternative options/solutions for algorithms. But on the other hand may distract from people who are actually struggling with a real problem.

Also, for algorithms/improvements, you have programming or programming puzzle stackexchange which may be better suited. And when talking about algorithms/programming it's not really specific to Arduino anymore, as at this point it's usually C/C++.



My example:
I have an LED matrix of 12x12, but they are connected in an "S" way.
Like for example:

 1  2  3  4
 8  7  6  5
 9 10 11 12
16 15 14 13


Now I would have to map these LED nr's to X-Y coordinates (which is not just x+y*width because it's in an S pattern).

I feel it's not really Arduino specific and I already have (2 actually) answers for it, but I'm really curious to see if there's another simpler solution to it (to the logic to my own solution).



Also, I'm curious if as in code-golf you're allowed to state that the answer with least bytes / fastest execution time (or something like that) will 'win'? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it allowed to ask a question if you've already have an solution/answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In general, [yes, you're allowed](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer). However, the question and the self-answer should be judged on its own just like normal Q&A, meaning they should be on-topic, standalone, self-contained, etc. For code-golf, there's already a site dedicated for it: [codegolf.se]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. thanks for the link to the article about answering your own question, I now see that can also be used to encourage others to come up with a 'better' or alternative solution.


















You're kind of in a borderland area there :)

I would say:


If you are looking for other ways to implement something, or
Your code uses the Arduino API or Arduino libraries, or
You have something that "works" but you don't know if it's the "right" way of doing it


then sure, go for it. While it could apply to other environments, if you're doing on Adruino with Arduino libraries (like the FastLED library for example) then I for one have no problem with it.

I wouldn't go for the "code golf" thing though. What the "best" answer is would be very subjective. Readability could be more beneficial than shaving one clock cycle off the execution - especially when the Arduino API itself is not that efficient in the first place.

As far as your example goes, I would submit an answer. It would contain something like:

int ledNumber = (y * width) + ((y & 1) ? (width - x - 1) : x);

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good one. I could ask it on Arduino.SE to get a solution (and possible multiple), or potentially ask help to improve the execution speed if required. But if I would be interested in the more theoretical/mathematical solution, there is other SE's that are better fit. (In that case one could/would strip the "algorithm" from it's implementation, which also makes it not about Arduino)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also I found a few other LED strip table projects which do have different solutions (such as putting the whole list in PROGMEM) and I myself had the same solution as you (except I used modulo to check for odd/even), but I figure your bitwise-& would be more efficient.


















I've had a couple of flags declined which has made me wonder if I fully understand the use of particular flags on Arduino:SE, so I'm going to post this as a question here in the hope of getting some guidance.



Flag: Not An Answer

A little while back, I flagged https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/35886/33608this answer as Not an Answer since it doesn't appear to make any attempt to answer the question that the OP had actually asked.  The guidance for the flag states:


  This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question. It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether.


In this case - in my opinion - the answer posted makes no attempt to answer the question that was asked. A later (upvoted) comment seems to agree.  Yet the flag was declined:


  declined - flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies, or an altogether wrong answer


Now, the answer in this case doesn't appear to be 'technically inaccurate', or 'wrong'.  It just makes no attempt to answer the question that was asked!

Now, my analogy here would be if I asked how to get from London to Glasgow without using the train, and the reply told me to catch the 12:42 train from Euston.  Yes, it's an answer, it may not be 'technically inaccurate', or 'wrong', but it doesn't make any attempt to answer the question that I actually asked!

So what am I missing?



Flag: Very Low Quality

Today, I flagged https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/63165/33608this answer for being Very Low Quality because it doesn't appear to be an answer to the question that was asked, although in this case it does attempt to address an 'assumption' mentioned by the OP in that question.

Now, I would say - again in my opinion - that this should have been posted as a comment on the question, rather than as an answer.  However the user that posted the answer doesn't have sufficient rep to post comments.

The actual question is clearly stated both in the title, and in the body of the question, and this makes no attempt to answer it.  

My first reaction was to flag it as Not an Answer since the fact that it should be a comment is explicitly given as a reason in the guidance for that flag.  However, given my previous experience I thought I'd play safe and just flag it as Very Low Quality since - again in my opinion - the content problems mean that it also meets the criteria for that flag:


  This question has severe formatting or content problems. This question is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed.


(Incidentally, the user that posted the answer has since made it clear in the comments that they were addressing the assumption rather than the question)

Again, the flag was declined:


  declined - flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies, or an altogether wrong answer


Once again, the answer doesn't appear to be 'technically inaccurate', or 'wrong'. As before, it just make no attempt to answer the question that was asked!

So, was I wrong to flag this as Very Low Quality?  Should it instead have been flagged as Not an Answer (as my first instinct suggested)?  Or should we not bother flagging answers like this at all?



Clearly I am missing something, and some guidance would be appreciated here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Flagging: "Not an Answer", "Very Low Quality" or something else?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5this answers should be closed by voting. the privilege is awarded at 500 reputation points, so you have itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj That is for questions.  Vote to delete answers is awarded at 2000 rep.


















Flag: Not An Answer

Answers should not be flagged just because they are wrong, or even appear to answer a different question, as in your example. "Not an answer" would be something like "I had this problem too, can you help me?". If it looks like an answer, then it is an answer, or to put it another way not not an answer. Voting answers like this down is the appropriate thing to do, as that reduces workload on the moderators.



Flag: Very Low Quality

This flag is for stuff like "nope, that won't work" or similar short, unpunctuated, unhelpful answers (or complete nonsense). I think this particular answer from your example doesn't really answer the question, but it is presented as an answer, and thus is neither low quality nor "not an answer". Again, voting it down, and/or adding a comment disagreeing with it is the appropriate thing to do.



It costs you a bit of rep to vote answers down (this is to discourage people from whimsically doing that) however you have other tools at your disposal:


Make a comment pointing out, politely, that this answer either won't work or doesn't address the question.
Vote up a better answer, that will put the "bad" answer down the list where people will give it less credit.
Make your own, better, answer. Personally I think that answering it yourself, and showing what a good answer is, with explanations and detail is really helping the site out. Merely pointing out that other answers are bad isn't quite as helpful. Other people will then, hopefully, agree with you and vote you up. Then you get rep points for your fabulous answer. Win win!

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough. Although that does directly contradict the guidance for the NAA flag, which states '_This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question_'. I'll try to use your definitions when flagging in future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds like there's always going to be a fuzzy area in interpretation of "is or is not an answer" between something like "Is structured as an answer" to "Does not help the person asking". That is, deciding to consider only the structure and not the textual meaning, or to consider the meaning and structure together.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose it depends on whether you focus on "does not **answer** the question" or "does not answer **the question**". These have different emphases. My general attitude is "if it looks like an answer, and is at least vaguely related to the question" then it is OK. We have rep voting and vote-to-close for other sorts of answers. If it looks like an answer, and isn't something ridiculous like "to do that, boil the eggs for another 10 minutes" then that isn't really something a moderator needs to look at.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I *think* that the **Very low quality** flag puts it into the **Low Quality Posts** queue, so if there is an answer that shouldn't be there, then that is how it should be flagged. At least, that is the assumption that I've been working under. This flag appears to result in no required moderator intervention Whereas the **Not an answer** flag does seem to require mod attention, and this attention would not have been necessary, had the answer been instead flagged as **Very low quality**. But I may be wrong - I was confused about this for quite a few years.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If there is doubt, you could vote to close instead. That lets the general community decide whether they agree with you.


















With respect to this question, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/63693/need-help-with-wire-connections-and-codeNeed help with wire connections and code, I feel sorry for the OP, as their code's indentation seems to get worse at each edit iteration.

There are obvious code errors in the sketch (one of which I pointed out in my answer). However, it's impossible to follow the code now as a lot of indentation has been removed, and I gave up trying.

I thought about fixing the indentation in the question, for the OP, but I stopped myself. However, I've seen that Majenko, on occasion, has submitted an answer (i.e. https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13162/coding-problems/13172#13172here), with the code correctly indented, rather than fixing indentation of the code in the question, and without actually correcting the code errors, but pointing them out instead, for the OP to fix.

Is that what I should do in this case (or rather, would that be an acceptable answer)? Or should I fix the indentation in the question itself? 

I really only want to just fix the indentation and have it posted somewhere - hopefully after that the error will be a lot more obvious to point out.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Formatting and indenting (but not fixing) code in questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion, it is acceptable to edit the question to adjust what amounts to the *whitespace* of poorly formatted code, so long as the actual function is not changed (so as not to corrupt the question as asked). This has the benefit of helping those who come along later and find the question -- so they may be able to understand whether or not it helps them.


















I don't believe there is any problem at all in editing a question to improve it. If you weren't supposed to do that, there wouldn't be that privilege. See:
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/editHelp Center > Privileges > edit questions and answers

What is edit questions and answers?
We believe in the power of community editing. That means once you've generated enough reputation, we trust you to edit anything in the system without it going through peer review. Not just your posts— anyone's posts!
When should I edit posts?
Any time you feel you can make the post better, and are inclined to do so. Editing is encouraged!
Some common reasons to edit are:

to fix grammatical or spelling mistakes
to clarify the meaning of a post without changing it
to correct minor mistakes or add addendums / updates as the post ages
to add related resources or hyperlinks


So that is pretty clear that tidying up a question is not only OK, it is encouraged! New posters may not realize how to format code, for example. So rather than ticking them off, you can improve it for them, maybe posting a comment underneath explaining how you did that, to help them for next time.

As for the specific whitespace issue, sometimes I copy code, run it through the IDE auto-format, and paste it back. The more readable the code is, the easier to fix bugs! You could, again, explain how you did that, and why it helps.

I think that at the time, I had just got exasperated that their edits had regressed the formatting that I had already done. `auto-format`, well there's a menu item that I had never ever noticed before - excellent, that is much more efficient. As they say, you learn something new every day :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Greenonline - I'm not suggesting that **you** were ticking anyone off. I think it is useful, as far as possible :) when replying to, or commenting on, posts to help the poster improve their posts. This answer was intended to be more general than just be addressed to you. These meta posts will persist into the future.


















A question is flagged as "off-topic" because it only peripherally involves an Arduino. For example "How do I get my Arduino to turn on a motor using a transistor?". Should it be closed altogether, migrated to Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange (where they are used to questions about transistors), or left here as a good beginner's Arduino question? Alternatively would you dismiss the flag and let the community handle the question via down-votes or vote-to-close?

Many of our users are just starting out in programming. To them, it can be hard to spot the difference between digitalWrite and DigitalWrite, or digtalWrite. Also, there is a well-known phenomenon that we all suffer from called Code Blindness - from looking at the code for so long that you can no longer really see what is there.

In these situations, a fresh pair of eyes is essential to spot little errors like these. 

Is it off topic? Possibly. However, that's not helpful to the novice user trying to get their first (non-built-in example) program to compile. 

So I say answer the question pointing out (gently) what is wrong. 

They come here looking for our help. It's our job to give them that help (as long as they're asking something about Arduino and not C++ programming in general unless pertaining to working on a microcontroller and the restrictions that imposes) - whether or not that question and answer help someone else in the future.

Who knows? These small typos made by novice users are common. Maybe it will help someone else in future. Probably not though. But still, that user went away happy and the overall impression of the helpfulness of this site increased by a tiny margin.

If the question ends up being closed by the community in the future, no matter - the OP is happy and will come back again and maybe bring their friends with them.

VE7JRO Q + A


  A question has a lengthy number of comments under it suggesting various possible solutions to the asked problem. Once the number of comments reaches 20 the system (Community) automatically flags it suggesting that the comments be moved to chat. You move the comments to chat as suggested, and then get a complaint from a user that "valuable information is now hidden away in chat rather than under the question where it should be". How do you respond?


If the complainant has enough reputation, I would ask them to add the "valuable information" to the question. If they don't have the rep, I would do it for them.


  How will you handle questions that doesn't require knowledge about the Arduino platform to answer (general coding questions, general electronics questions)?


Some of these questions can be migrated to other places within Stack Exchange, if an appropriate place exists.

I've noticed some experienced users will answer these types of questions in the comments. Perhaps it's because they know the question is off topic and will be migrated or closed. This may not be what comments are for, but I am OK with it, providing the question is sure to be closed. IMHO, the most important thing we do is help people solve their problems. If a quick comment like "HINT: URL TO THE ANSWER", solves the OP's problem, mission accomplished.


  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?


If the user's comments are inappropriate, a moderator should delete them. If any person feels that a comment is not relevant to the question/answer, flag it for moderator attention. Users who raise 80 helpful flags are awarded a silver badge, and 500 helpful flags is a gold badge.

Arguments are rare on Ard.SE, but are a normal part of human interaction. A long time ago, people believed the world was flat. Then, people argued about it. Sometime after that, I was born, went to school, and was taught the world was round. Differences in opinion occur throughout one's lifetime.


  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?


I would discuss it with them first. If two moderators can not reach a consensus, the third moderator should decide the final outcome.


  A question is flagged as "off-topic" because it only peripherally involves an Arduino. For example "How do I get my Arduino to turn on a motor using a transistor?". Should it be closed altogether, migrated to Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange (where they are used to questions about transistors), or left here as a good beginner's Arduino question? Alternatively would you dismiss the flag and let the community handle the question via down-votes or vote-to-close?


It should be migrated. Sure, it's nice to have a few of these Q+As on Ard.SE to "guide" the OP in the right direction, BUT, what if the answer gives bad advise? A question just like this was asked 10 days ago. Four people plus myself voted to close. The question is now closed, but not deleted from the system yet. I have a problem with one of the answers. It recommends using a IRF540 MOSFET. A quick look at the data sheet shows testing was done with a VGS of 10V. That's a big red flag for me. I would have recommended a Logic Level MOSFET such as the RFP30N06LE.

I've been "lurking" on the Electrical Engineering network for 241 days, and see this same type of question asked over and over again. On EE, they can get into great detail about which MOSFET is the best to use with a micro controller, and how to use it properly.


  How would you prefer to handle a Question, if the source of the problem is only a typo in the OP's source code?


If the typo is a missing curly bracket or semi-colon, someone will point that out to the OP. If they answer in the comments, I up-vote the comment. If they make a proper answer, I up-vote it. Once the OP acknowledges the problem is solved, I would put the question on hold, which means the system will eventually delete it.

According to this page https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic, off topic is: "If the solution would be the same with or without Arduino, then it's usually a general coding question."

So I guess that means a for or while loop with incorrect syntax is off topic too.

Whats on topic? The same webpage says: "Specific questions about Arduino boards, code…". If the OP includes a sketch with their question, and it compiles in the IDE, then isn't it Arduino code? When I try to compile an Arduino sketch using XCode, it fails. The same thing happens when I use Visual Studio.

Right now, I am one of the few people who is voting to NOT-close most of these types of questions. They are still being closed because 5 people voted to close. What happens if I'm elected as a moderator? Do I step on 5 peoples toes and over-ride their decision? Of course not. A moderator works for the community and aligns themselves the the communities goals, keeping the community within the rules set by Stack Exchange. I don't agree with the people closing these questions, but I respect their decision.


  In your opinion, what do moderators do?


I've read on meta.stackexchange.com that they are "unicorn yodelers": https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/166628https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/166628


  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?


That's cool with me.


  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?


Right now, it takes my vote plus 4 more to put a "unclear what you are asking", "too broad" or "off topic" question on hold. As a moderator, I will be quick to click the "Put question on hold" button, if such a button exists. Keep in mind, it will still take time before the system deletes it. The OP can still edit the question which will automatically add it to the "Re-open" queue. If the OP improves the question so it can be answered, I would be just as quick to click a "re-open" button. Sometimes people just need a "nudge" in the right direction in order for them to do the right thing.

I am the author of that question. And I am for the SO approach. Why? Because it is possible to generate endless count of this kind of questions as anonymous user and then answer them. I don't know if an anonymous user can accept an answer, but this answers tend to get upvotes.

A comment can point out the error and the question should be closed as "Unclear what you are asking" in the meaning "it is obvious".

If I may ask, did you observe a pattern to that end on this stack, i.e. a large number of question of this kind that disrupts the operation of the site? 1 rep users can in fact accept answers but they cannot upvote. I have never heard of suspicious voting behaviour with this sort of questions so far.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree about closing as "_Unclear what you are asking_".  If we want to close these questions because they're one-off problems & might generate endless numbers of similar questions, then we should have a custom close reason for that purpose.


















With respect to https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2411/17196Nick's answer:  


  please vote up Majenko's suggestion if you approve of it [...]


I take it that this proposal is accepted by the community. 

I would like to ask the moderators to include it in the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp center's page on on-topicness as part of standing policy. The help center is the place where we would point new users to to learn about how to use the site. It is also more likely1 for new users to check the help center vs. going through a site's meta to figure out what is on-topic and what is not. 

Something along the line of the snippet taken from EE should do fine. If you like it could be fleshed out a little more to outline what kind of questions are ok that are related to purchasing recommendations. This is from https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicRaspberryPi.SE:


  [...] However, if you have a specific product and you want to know if it is suitable for a specific purpose [...], that's fine. Asking what to look for in a kind of product is also fine [...].




1) I accept the fact that both probabilities are rather small unfortunately.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Activity on this page is fairly limited. :) However I have no objection to the proposal. What was the *specific* proposed wording you had in mind?


















I have seen questions about ATtiny microcontrollers on the site without anyone objecting. I was wondering where the line between what's on or off topic here is. As I understand it is possible to program a lot of microcontrollers with Arduino IDE even using Arduino boards as programmers. Help Center indicates:

On topic:
Specific questions about Arduino boards, code, and the Arduino IDE. Feel free to ask about anything related to Arduino. ...

Would it be correct to assume that questions about everything and anything that can be programmed with Arduino IDE would be considered on-topic here? If not, where is the line? Are tinyAVR controller questions still officially OK?
I would like to clarify:
I think I kind of get the idea about the programming part a bit better. I am more interested to find out about questions related to ATtiny controllers and programming functions specific to them(more about the electronic side so to speak, than the programming language, that is clearly better suited for Stack Overflow). If at the same time I can ask a more general question about all AVRs and other controllers programmable with Arduino software that is perhaps more useful to the community - even better, but ATtinies are my main interest. Is it OK to ask specific questions about them here even though they might not be that relevant to actual Arduino boards using ATmega chips?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about all AVR microcontrollers considered to be on-topic on Arduino SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we turn it around, what is not? If it's an Atmega328 (not Arduino Board), programmed w/o Arduino IDE, w/o Arduino libraries, it's not. In any other case, if the question is somewhat related of the "Arduino side", it's fine to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Say I program ATtiny84A, I use Arduino IDE, libraries and all that stuff, but I happen to be interested in for example high voltage programming and setting fuse bits to lets say turn the resset pin into input pin(just an example), that is not really that relevant to Arduino boards maybe, what then?..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Paul,do you think it is OK to consider ATtiny controllers as Arduino-like controllers and therefore questions about them to be on-topic on Arduino SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5if you're programming it with Arduino language, and the question is about Arduino language, it's fine. If you're uploading the code with Arduino IDE and the question is about Arduino IDE, it's fine. If the question is about ATTiny84 and not related to Arduino IDE or Libraries/Code, it may fit better on electronics stackexchange. (I kind off miss the Embedded Systems Stack Exchange, would be perfect)


















It seems to be a fuzzy line separating that. Observation seems to reveal that anything that is or can be programmed with the Arduino IDE, or more specifically, the "Arduino API" (for lack of a better term; meaning the device setup registers, Port I/O and similar actions are abstracted away from the coder) is acceptable.

However, questions that an Arduino user (that is often a relative newcomer to C/C++ and/or embedded device programming) might ask, but which are merely questions about the programming language/structure and do not touch on an aspect of embedded computing or Arduino and Arduino-like platforms are closed as off-topic.

There are some who advocate that even pure programming questions are acceptable as long as the user is in the realm of working on Arduino and its friends, but it would seem that those kind of questions have no problem getting the required number of close votes.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wrote a response to this answer in a comment, but then decided to move to the question as it probably clarifies it a bit. Please see the updated question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are boards like the DigiSpark which are part of the unofficial arduino-like family, with board definitions in the Arduino IDE, and which use ATTiny chips. I would not see that ATTiny vs ATMega makes much difference to the relevance of a question here, all else being equal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you. That is what I want to know. I guess there is nothing very different about ATtiny controllers when they are off those boards and programmed with an Arduino as ISP, so I assume they could be called as you nicely put it - Arduino-like family.


















Yes, it's fuzzy. "Related to Arduino" could easily be considered to be something using the same processor as one of the many Arduinos.

There is a school of thought that the https://electronics.stackexchange.com/Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange is a more appropriate place to ask general questions about the AVR processors, and there certainly are some knowledgeable people there. This would be especially so if such a question has a related complex electronics component.


  Are tinyAVR controller questions still officially OK? 


I don't see any problem with that. You can program them with the IDE.



As a moderator here, I wouldn't be closing questions just because they involve tinyAVR processors, or any of the Atmel ones, really. You might be better off asking complex questions which don't really involve the Arduino IDE in any way on https://electronics.stackexchange.com/Electronics SE* however there is no requirement to do so.

That site also has quite a few questions directly about the Arduino. Some of them get migrated over here, many do not. There is a bit of cross-pollination between the two sites.



* Electronics SE and Electrical Engineering SE are the same thing.

I find it contradictory to the concept of upvoting that someone finds a question worthy of an answer, yet unworthy of an upvote.  

I get the impression that it is a bit egotistical to not even care to upvote.  I also get the impression that these are point seekers, who care little about evaluating and awarding credit where credit is due.  

As a longtime SO user, I believe that it would be only fair to award 1 upvote per answer (and deter the answerer from downvoting the question, naturally).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Any answer to a question automatically upvotes said question - FEATURE-REQUESTb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That sounds like a fundamental change to the underlying code. Nothing that we can do about that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In what way is that a fundamental change? Not to the code, surely? `if (question_is_answered) UpVoteQuestion();` However it might cause unexpected consequences.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This feature is not specific to this particular branch of Stackexchange but to the whole network. A change to that mechanism is very unlikely to be implemented on this stack only. The question therefore needs to be taken to Meta.Stackexchange, like Nick's answer suggests.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The upvote button tooltip has "The question shows research effort; it is useful and clear". Usually it is easy to answer a question without research effort. It only takes the research effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5that is for OTHERS.  anyone who answers a question automatically deems it answer-worthy, therfore upvatable.  Otherwise one might argue that the answerer is only after points...


















Every community creates its microculture influenced by a handful of alpha users who tend to develop a clique and impose a standard of behavior and quality evaluation.

Arduino community doesnt seem as humble and nurturing as most SE communities.  One user, for example, compares arduino users to stubborn, ignorant horses in his personal description.  

IMO, every answer should AUTOMATICALLY award an irreversible upvote to the question it answers.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It bothers me too that there aren't enough upvotes on Arduino SE. I am yet to come up with a good solution. One thing that doesn't work in our favour is that we have so many new users every day who ask their question, get an answer and then never stick around to pay it forward. And because they are in and out they don't read/learn the guides that SE is founded on, resulting often in poor questions. The users who do stick around are great. But we all could put more effort into upvoting (me included). You are right in that we can change the culture by leading by example.


















You raise an interesting point, although the concept would probably belong to every part of the Stack Exchange network, and thus might be better put at https://meta.stackexchange.com/https://meta.stackexchange.com/.

You might argue that someone might answer a bad question, so upvoting a question just because it gets an answer might skew the results a bit. In fact, if every question is automatically upvoted by an answer it might conceivably push people to not answer, or answer in a comment, which could change existing behaviour.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5one might argue so.  but a bad question does not deserve answering if it cannot be fixed.  if it CAN be fixed, then it becomes a good question and deserving of answer(s).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@tonygil Hmm... I have seen bad questions that have shown little work on the askers part, which I *have* then answered (perhaps wrongly), maybe because I felt sorry for them or to get them on their way or it was a commonly asked question (but couldn't find the duplicate), but didn't feel that the question was worth upvoting (for a range of reasons: obvious answer, little forethought on their part, poorly worded/presented etc.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5but, in general, that is not the case


















As per https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/q/45/56216How do we get syntax highlighting?, only the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/programmingprogramming tag has the feature enabled.

But I'm seeing that the tag https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/arduino-unoarduino-uno also is highlighting the code, for example https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/9843/calculating-time-between-serial-eventsthis question.

Are there more tags out there that have syntax highlighting? I edited a couple of questions to add the programming tag but maybe sometimes it won't be necessary and it's a cool feature that all answers follow the question highlight.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What tags have syntax highlighting enabled?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the C++ tag also has it enabled.


















The short answer to your question is to use this syntax: <!-- language-all: lang-cpp --> right above the first block of code.

Here is an example of a question with the syntax highlighting "not working".

https://i.stack.imgur.com/iRFXU.png


Paste in the "html style" syntax as specified in the next image.


https://i.stack.imgur.com/3c0tm.png


Add 4 spaces.


https://i.stack.imgur.com/4LCwS.png


Give it a few seconds, then the highlighting should start working.

Using this method, all of the following code "blocks" will be treated as C++.

Does using the HTML language syntax on the Question automatically enables it on Answers? Because that's what I think it's the cool feature of it being associated with a tag, any post on that question will have it enabled.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5More to the point, can moderators see the list of tags with an associated syntax highlighting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure if tags on the main site provide syntax highlighting. Time for me to do some testing. Here is a question with no highlighting: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/30312/high-rate-of-transmission-errors-50-using-xbee-radio. Let's see what happens if I add the C++ tag...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It worked :) Keep in mind, there is a limit of 5 tags per question, so if there are 4 or less existing tags, adding the C++ tag fixes the syntax highlighting issue for a question with one block of code (I haven't tested it with multiple code blocks yet). If there were already 5 tags set, which one do you "remove" to add the C++ tag to make the syntax highlighting work? You don't remove any of them, just add the HTML type syntax I've shown you in my answer, and it will apply C++ syntax highlighting to every block of code in the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Adding the C++ tag to a question will not automatically highlight all the code in every answer. As far as what moderator can and can not see, I am not at liberty to say, but I am confident saying I have never seen any tool, or page, or anything else that gives me a list of tags with their associated syntax highlighting. People often mix C++, Python, HTML, Processing, etc, code in their question/answers, so applying syntax highlighting based on one language is not always desirable.


















Funnily enough, I was going to post this as a question myself, but didn't know where to do so...

In http://Silicon%20Valley%20S02E03Silicon Valley S02E03, Gilforth is reading the Arduino Projects book and has an Uno and a shield on it. At the risk of sneaking in a question within an answer, what shield is it?

I know people questions are not clear, demanding etc etc...

It's the first question for most of them and they might even don't know how to use the stackexchange and just seeking help! i think stackexchange https://arduino.stackexchange.com/conductcode of conduct is not really followed by some in Arduino stackexchange...

Is it because people want to get that "badge" related to down votes and just looking for something that is a bit wrong to press that down button?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why there's so many down votes in question list?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Critic* is the only badge related to downvotes and is awarded just once per user for the *First down vote*. It's been awarded 379 times on this stack. So it really does not explain downvoting... but downvotes do serve a function as Majenko's answer outlines. Whether this goal is achieved best by downvotes or something else has been discussed for year. Half of Stackexchange's meta is full of it...


















No, it's usually because those questions really are generally terrible. A step away from being closed, and two away from being deleted as gibberish.

Down-voting is a way of saying "This question is terrible. It needs work." but it's not so bad that it's worthy of closing as "unclear what you are asking". 

Whether someone knows how to "use" Stack Exchange or not is no reason to ask questions like "I did this but it don't[sic] work. Here's my code". Wherever you ask a question it is surely just common courtesy to explain your problem clearly and succinctly. Here is no different to any other forum in that respect.

It may be possible, if you take the time and effort, to reformat the invariably "dumped on us" code and work out what his problem is (often the code is just gibberish), but most people just go "Nah, stuff you" and down-vote it as a bad question.

Another situation is where you have the same user asking basically the same question in different ways, where an answer has been given earlier and the new question is a slight modification of the original one as a kind of answer to the answer. Not strictly a duplicate, but still should really have been done as an edit to the first question.

Note that you can't go below 1 reputation - so down-votes to a new user really have no effect on the user. They only serve as an indication to those passing by that the question is probably not worth wasting your time reading.

They can't be bothered to even include the code (even badly formatted) in the question. Downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5my point is; it's better to guide them to " post your code. use code tags" or "explain the problem clearly" etc and if the OP didn't do any of that then give the OP an down vote...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like newbie, I too feel that there is an undercurrent of negative voting. I've seen questions that I felt were reasonable - it could be argued that they were not great - but they weren't terrible - and yet they attracted negative votes. I've even seen an answer which seemed reasonable that had attracted 2 down votes (with no comments explaining why). Someone eventually posted a comment saying that a possible reason for the down votes was that they did not start their sentences with "capital letters". IMHO, there are some who may have forgotten what it is like to be starting from zero knowledge


















Stack Exchange is aware that it can be unfriendly to newbies, and indeed as I write this there is a message directly above where I am typing:


  newbie is a new contributor. Be nice, and check out our https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/conductCode of Conduct


I know very well that when you have a problem you want a quick solution and you don't really want to muck around reading about how to format your question, blah blah, you just want an answer.

However there are quite a few people here who are basically here just to help. Just as an example https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/7508/edgar-bonetEdgar Bonet has asked one question but answered 745 at the time I write this. There are lots of other users like him, who look at the site every day and try hard to be helpful.

So sit back for a moment and imagine what it is like to try hard every day to help people with their Arduinos, and then see questions which are so poorly written it is almost impossible to help. I don't mean dumb questions (there aren't dumb questions) but just insultingly badly written questions. For example:


There is no obvious question, or even a question at all. Perhaps just a dump of an error message followed by the word "help!". Or, worse, just the comment that they "got an error" and "how do I fix it?".
The code is unreadable because the poster hasn't taken the time to find how to format it (ie. selecting it and pressing Ctrl+K). Not only that but after making their post, and seeing it look like gibberish on the screen, they don't make an effort to find out what is wrong, when something obviously is.
We are told there is an error but the error isn't actually quoted. As you know, compilers generate lots of error messages, so just being told "I got an error" is virtually a useless thing to say.


I've done a Meta post about https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2523/how-to-ask-a-good-question-for-arduino-stack-exchangeHow to ask a good question and I sort-of hope that newbies will read it. However judging by the sort of questions asked, I doubt that many do.

So, at the end, our regular users (the people who answer questions) can sometimes get a little terse when confronted with a question that seems to show that the poster hasn't really tried very hard to help him or herself to start with (such as searching for the solution before asking).


  Is it because people want to get that "badge" related to down votes and just looking for something that is a bit wrong to press that down button?


No, I don't think people are motivated to get that badge. As Ghanima pointed out, the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/badgesbadge you are thinking of is "Critic". You only get that once, and I suppose the point of it is to encourage you to down-vote bad questions. I mean, if you don't tell someone that they have done something wrong (hopefully politely) then they will continue to do that wrong thing, won't they?



Your question is a good one -- it can be frustrating to be down-voted, but it also can be frustrating to see a really badly formatted and incomprehensible question. It would be great if everyone followed the https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/conductCode of Conduct and also if people asking questions read https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2523/how-to-ask-a-good-question-for-arduino-stack-exchangeHow to ask a good question.

Building community and fixing toxic communities have been a theme this past year on the network.

I thought I would share my recent experience regarding this.  I've been around SO since the beta, so I think I've got (a) a bit of experience in the community aspect of SO and (b) a relatively thick skin.

I just had a rather unpleasant experience with a preemptively closed question and the subsequent moderator interaction.
I stopped engaging when this comment was made, not because I'm a snowflake who can't handle the language, but because it was obvious that I was not being taken seriously.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Im8sx.png

This is the first time in 11 years that I feel I've been treated unfairly or disrectfully (a key aspect of "toxic" communication as I understand it) by a moderator, so I would just like to bring this to everyone's attention.  It's possible of course that the moderator was just having communications difficulty, but tone as well as content and context does matter in terms of showing respect.

As a practical thing, It's better that arduino.se depend on member voting for closure than having moderators preemptively close (excepting of course spam, abuse, etc).  Perhaps the moderators can coordinate amongst themselves and reconsider their closing strategy.
FWIW!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Toxic moderation harms the communityb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just for context [this](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/67681/upload-a-hex-file-to-a-cortex-m3-from-the-mac-command-line) appears to be the question being discussed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NickGammon, I deleted that question and replaced it [here](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/67733/how-do-i-upload-an-arduino-stm32-binary-from-the-mac-command-line), with (a) the answer and (b) mentioning that the executable was generated via Arduino.  I made it CW since the most important part of the answer is from Majenko.  I also corrected my mistake of assuming that anyone familiar enough with executable uploading would understand that it applied to Arduino and non-Arduino executables equally.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I still feel that heavy-handed preemptive moderation detracts from the community and the overall quality of the site, though.  Muh Feelz!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MarkHarrison by doing so you also removed the context which is inherently needed for the discussion here. The original one was absolutely off-topic in my opinion while the re-formulated new one might not be. After this manipulation one will likely second your accusation, which is now neither objective nor fair to the moderator you accuse. After all: is this really about your actual problem?!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SimSon, Sorry... if your reputation is high enough you can see deleted posts, or you can request a moderator to undelete it. You can blame the original problem on me, for (incorrectly) assuming that everyone understood that once a hex file has been generated the answer is the same no matter what was used to generate the binaries.  So I generated another hex file with Arduino-specific gcc options, and re-asked the question referring to the second hex file rather than the first.  Speaking for myself, I'm satisfied that all moderators have presented their opions well here...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SimSon ... and that they may take a "lighter" touch towards moderation, which I feel will decrease bad feelings.  I learned something interesting from Majenko (I had to tell him he didn't understand programming for him to say it, haha!), and the site has a potentially useful question for people that typically work with command line tools rather than IDEs.  If you can't get the page in any other way feel free to send a note to my email address on my profile page and I'll send it to you so you can let me know what you think.  I'm interested in your opinion, I could be very wrong after all!


















Getting even the most basic of information out of you was like getting blood out of a stone. I guess from your point of view, since you already have all the information, that you can't understand our frustration.

When we had finally got some basic information out of you to make any kind of sense of your question it turned out that it had nothing at all to do with Arduino anyway. 

If you had:


Had a problem with creating the software for your board using the Arduino API or the Arduino IDE, or
Were asking how to manually upload a hex file to an Arduino board


then it would have been on topic and we would have been able to help you.

As it is, you refused to tell us what the board is that you are using (eventually we got the manufacturer of the chip out of you, but still no clue what the board is) despite being repeatedly asked.

If we ask you for information it's not just to annoy you. It's because we need it to be able to answer your question!

My suggestion remains that, if you're concerned about community, the moderators should meet and try to iron out an approach that focuses on the community taking action and doesn't focus on an individual moderator closing question and engaging in toxic dialog.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding the on-topic nature... it is exactly the tool to use for uploading an Arduino binary to an STM32.  I don't know how much you know about software, but once you have a standalone binary the subsequent portions of the toolchain are independent of that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have spent my entire working career in software. I am the author of an IDE that is far superior to the Arduino IDE. But that's beside the point. The tool for uploading code from the Arduino IDE to a board using the Arduino API is the Arduino IDE. There may be a stand-alone command line tool in the background doing the work, but if you're not using it from within the Arduino IDE or a similarly Arduino-centric IDE that is configured to run the binary for you, then that is nothing to do with Arduino.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And it is you who does not get it. There are (at the last count) *four* different tools for communicating with the *same* chips. Which tool you use depends to a large extent on the board (NOT the chip) and which tool the board designer chose to aim the board at. Be that `dfu-util` through an FT232 adapter, `stm32flash` through serial, `micronucleus` through the Micronucleus bootloader or `stlink` through an STLink programmer. Which tool is the *right* tool to use for your board is not dependent on just the chip.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you're incorrect regarding there being a single tool for uploading binaries, as exemplified by https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/20978/is-there-a-way-to-upload-precompiled-code-to-an-arduino .  But keep in mind that this post is about the toxicity of arduino.se.  I think the tone of your comments is enough to demonstrate the point.  Note that you have provided an excellent answer in your comment of three minutes ago.  If my question ever undeletes, you should post it as an answer... I would definitely upvote it!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MarkHarrison, Majenko was elected as moderator despite saying in the questionnaire "Would I make a good moderator? No, probably not.

I wholeheartedly agree the Arduino:SE should be more welcoming.  However, it is also true that it can be difficult to get people to update their questions with information and/or improvements that have been requested in comments.  



In this case, as far as the question itself goes, I've read through your question, and the comments and I still can't see how it is https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicon-topic for this site.  If it hadn't been closed by a moderator, I would probably have voted to close the question when I saw it in a review queue.

As regards your interactions with others in the comments, I'll just note that you are fairly experienced in using SE sites, so I assume you are aware that if you think that something has been said that violates the https://history.stackexchange.com/conductCode of Conduct you can always flag it, and/or report it to SE Community Managers.



As to your last point, I'm a moderator on another site, and I'm a great believer in the idea incorporated in the https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/Theory of Moderation that moderators should do "... as little as possible".  

I try not to use my super-vote to close questions if possible.  That is what community moderation is meant to be for. 

That's not to say that I don't participate in the review queues.  I'm happy to be the 5th-vote to close a question, but (apart from spam, and other posts that violate the https://history.stackexchange.com/conductSE Code of Conduct), the community decided what is on- and off-topic for that site, and so it should generally be the community that votes to close posts.

On that site, the community has agreed that they prefer a lighter touch from moderators.  It works there, and I suspect that it would probably also work here.

In my experience Arduino:SE has enough members who actively moderate via the review queues that moderators really shouldn't need to preemptively close posts quite as often as they currently appear to.  

But, at the end of the day, the fact is that it should be for the members of this site who need to decide what it is they want from the moderator team.  

If the consensus is that we want moderators to decide what is on- and off-topic, and preemptively close posts that are off-topic using their 'super-vote', then that's fine.  It wouldn't be my choice, but I'm happy to go with the consensus view.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"moderators really shouldn't need to preemptively close posts *quite* as often as they currently appear to." - I quite agree... of late, questions get closed with just one or two votes...


















I am having trouble understanding your complaint. Your question title says "Upload a hex file to a Cortex M3 from the Mac command line? [on hold]" and the title of this meta post is "Toxic moderation harms the community". It’s sounds like you are the judge, jury and executioner. To be honest, the meta title you have so carefully "crafted" reads just like a Main Stream Media Fake News headline.

Regarding your comment:


  "…It's better that arduino.se depend on member voting for closure than having moderators preemptively close…"


Your question was not closed, It was put "on hold" because it’s off-topic. Arduino.SE is a small community, and as such, we do not always have enough users with the required reputation level to "vote to close" questions.

A question "on hold" is waiting for the person to, for lack of a better term, "fix it’. It is not "closed", and won’t be until a period of time has elapsed. During the "on hold" phase, if the question is "fixed", any Arduino.SE moderator, or the required votes from the community can re-open it.

If the question is not re-opened, and a period of time has elapsed, the system will mark it as "closed". Does that mean your question is gone? Deleted? Never to be answered? Not necessarily. You can see "closed" questions by using the following text in the "Search on Arduino…" text box. Something like this: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed:1https://arduino.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed:1

Google also seems to be able to find the "closed" questions, because I have used Google to search for Arduino related "things", and Google has provided me with links to Arduino.SE Q + A’s with the following text in the question title: "[closed]". Don’t worry, the planet can still see your question, and will be able to answer it for a long, long time.

Regarding your comment:


  "I seem to be having problems with an individual moderator, so the Royal We form of pronoun shouldn't be used."


I agree with Majenko that your question is off-topic, so "we" is the correct word to use. In other words, if I had seen your question before Majenko put it "on hold", I would have put it "on hold" for the same reason.

Regarding your comment:


  "…But keep in mind that this post is about the toxicity of arduino.se.".


You are trying to "spin" your Cortex M3 "off-topic question" issue into an accusation that all of the Arduino.SE moderators are "toxic". The only thing making our community toxic right now is you.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've long aspired to a lucrative career in fake mainstream news headline writing, so thanks for the vote of confidence!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Does that mean your question is gone? Deleted? Never to be answered? Not necessarily." Sorry, I think you're not very familiar with how on-hold questions are dealt with.  Nobody can answer an on-hold question, so when a moderator preemptively puts a question on-hold it means the question will never receive an answer.  You can read about this over on the main meta: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10582/what-is-a-closed-on-hold-or-duplicate-questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nobody can answer a question after 5 people vote to close it either. You are assuming a moderator puts the question on hold and never revisits it. I keep a browser tab open for every question I put on hold. Once it meets the Arduino SE guidelines, I reopen it. If the OP doesn't "fix" it, the system closes it. The fact that an on hold or closed question can't be answered until it's "fixed" is good thing. We don't want answers to questions that are un-clear, to broad, etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In your case, the question is off topic so it should be closed, regardless of how many people voted to close it. https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questions. As far as having a bunch of closed questions "hanging around" forever, I don’t like it either. To combat this problem, I have been editing/improving a dozen or so every day. Once edited, the system moves them to the top of the Arduino home page for everyone to see. This usually results in an answer, comments to clarify the question, and sometimes, votes to close.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are over 2100 closed questions, so it’s going to take some time to get through them all. The next step is to delete the "Closed questions that are of no lasting value whatsoever should be flagged and deleted." https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-toolsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Notice that instead of responding to your incorrect understanding that an on-hold question can't be answered, you pivoted to a new claim regarding questions closed by five people. As a moderator, you should have the maturity to recognize when you've made a mistake or didn't understand the procedures. Nobody expects you to be perfect!  But you should really take some time and contemplate the fact that you pivoted (in a state of cognitive dissonance) to other issues which I never brought up, and totally refused to contemplate the issues that arise when moderators act disrespectfully. FWIW!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was correct. They can be answered, but first they have to be "fixed" and re-opened by several votes or a moderator. Your question was off topic, so the chances of it getting the required votes or a mod to re-open are some where between slim and none. I see you have deleted the question and created a wiki instead. Good job :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Over that past 11 years I've been a good sport on SO, and am happy to change my posts and thoughts to conform with the site.  Sorry, but you were wrong in what you stated, and your disrespect for the source of my original frustration (that I could not answer my own question when I found the information elsewhere) is not appreciated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The remainder of my comments were just in no particular order, but were for your information so you could learn more about the meaning of on hold and closed question. Here's another page about what the Arduino community considers off-topic: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic. This page is excellent because of all the useful links in the right sidebar.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the root cause of all of this chatter was "that I could not answer my own question when I found the information elsewhere", why didn't you title this meta question as such? Your title "Toxic moderation harms the community" accused me, the other moderator not involved, and Majenko as being "Toxic", which I find very rude and not true. Next time you have an issue, please use a flag to get a moderators attention instead of arguing publicly about it. Thank you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm still curious as to why changing the wording from "uploading hex file" to "uploading Arduino binary" suddenly made the question on topic.  Maybe I had assumed a level of understanding regarding uploading code to microprocessors that people didn't have?  Although I don't think so, because Majenko provided a great answer, although he only did it when I implied he didn't understand computer programming very well! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You mention that my first step should have been to flag the question for moderator attention.  That's exactly the first thing I did, and that's what kicked off the comment thread that I perceive as being disrepectful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have you ever been a moderator on any of the Stack Exchange networks? If you have been one in the past, then you know I can see every flag you have ever raised here at Arduino SE. This comment can be seen by the public so I can’t go into details, however, no flag was raised regarding your "STM32 Cortex M3" question. There were several edits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5hmm, then that's my mistake.  I thought I raised a flag, perhaps I made a comment instead?  My apologies for the mistake!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No problemo : )b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5sweet, thanks for listening so patiently to so much rambling! :)


















I agree with VE7JRO - the bot "Community" does this stuff. It is a bit annoying because you see a list of old questions for no obvious reason. Community is trying to either get an answer, or get someone to upvote an existing answer. Questions with no answers, or no answer with upvotes are considered by the bot to be open, and it is trying to jog us to do something about them.

The take-out for users in general is:


Answer questions in an answer, not just a comment. See https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commenthere.
Up-vote answers to indicate you agree with them (when appropriate) - don't just nod your head without reaching for your mouse.
If you asked the question, "accept" the best answer. Don't just silently accept the help without feeding back into the system that the answer worked.
If no answers seem to be particularly good, answer it yourself.
If it's an old question (and the OP probably has forgotten about it by now) then vote to close it.

Final note: The meta.meta.se new question has been deleted again while in the works by user https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/141525/animusonanimuson. Enough.


  Your question was closed because you're rambling on about a process
  that already exists just not in the exact form you desire, and your
  reasoning for wanting it are based on a false premise that you'd done
  absolutely nothing to try and resolve the correct way. We're not
  having another discussion about this where you don't listen to anyone.
  It's very clear from your behavior that you just want to ramble and
  ignore everyone's feedback. You did it for many hours yesterday.


I wrote yesterday about the existing procedure, you can find it searching for "Update2" on this page.


  Update2: some user noted in the comments that a recall procedure
  already exists. But 1) The procedure can be initiated by moderators
  and the company team only, the victims are excluded from the chance to
  initiate the trial, 2) there's no jury for decision making, again: the
  potential victims are excluded from the trial, 3) there's no guarantee
  that the trial will be properly anonymized and then published (the
  minutes could be published IF undefined needs arise). 4) there's no
  accessible archive of previous judgments. In general: someone could
  even question the existance of this procedure, because there's no way
  for the community to access it before, during, or after.


As animuson is a Senior Product Support Specialist at Stack Overflow... well, alea jacta est. I think is fair to say that StackOverflow took a definitive decision. And would be pure unsolicited bothering to insist. Not in my veins.

There's no point to contribute to SE if the judicial part is badly lacking minimum quality standards. And bad enough this is a common problem on all those modern platforms where a relatively small team of people must take care of a huge user base. They always tend to walk the shortcut, cutting down individual rights to save on time/costs. Then beautifying the democracity of the electron they are consuming. http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.htmlTime passes, some things didn't change (http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/story-of-mel.htmlyet). But nowadays plenty people collected enough experience about reputation-based systems; thanks to the past bad happenings on similar platforms (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWo9xDKXKq4Dave Jones' bitter Discovery ). The more bad stories, the more people awakes. Hopefully anytime soon there will be enough critical mass (of disgusted users with good ideas in mind) to force those companies to adopt what we once called "digital rights": privacy already got a step forward recently thanks to Edward Snowden. Freedom of Speech has been helped by the adoption of modern COW filesystems and flex information architectures, in the way censorship is shallow (ie: you don't see my messages any more, but there's good chance they still exist on multiple disks). And Bitcoin haven't been strangled in its baby cot like have been for DigiCash 20 years before. So, after all, things are going better. Despite small accidents like this one.

From now on, I won't be following the comments unless some good news from StackOverflow management. Please write new answers only, in the case a well grounded procedure for moderators removal has been established.

So I adapt myself: good luck on SE, bye bye, and thank you for all the (past and future) fish.



(I've been deleted AGAIN, on the way to split the issues. The following is what was in place.)

Author's note: After 2 days of discussions on 2 different topics, I'm re-editing the whole question(s) in order to make easier to partecipate. Thanks to all that helped pointing out existing procedures and resources.
Here you find the aruino.meta.se issue (alleged moderator abuse). On meta.meta.se you'll find https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333127/do-we-need-power-of-recall-to-avoid-moderator-abusesthe proposed general solution.
If you don't feel like being serious at the moment, just get some pop-corns and enjoy a quick and dirty representation of the following story: "https://orville.fandom.com/wiki/Majority_RuleThe Orville - Season 1, Episode 7, Majority Rule"

(Fair) STORYLINE

(please, report in comments if some detail is not fairly reported in this storyline; I linked all I could and survived the censorship, in order for anyone to be able to freely and indipendently shape his own idea)


I posted a https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/68446/usb-to-serial-chip-ch340b-internal-eeprom-programming-from-linuxquestion about the CH340 chips found on some arduino clones. The question has been put on hold first for being off-topic, deleted right after the second comment from me, asking for claryfication and quoting https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicthe on-topic list page stating the whole board and clones being in scope of arduino.se.
I asked myself wheter was worth or not to keep spending time helping others on this reputation-based social Q&A platform, because wrong judiciary officials can destroy your long lasting efforts in a second. I've been reading solutions on SE for a decade: do I really need to give back some of the goodies I got or it is better for me to keep leeching in silence and go back to the dear old https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txtRFC1855-based forum/ml/ng? Let's think positive, and try to solve the judiciary issue before going back to work: I owe to SE community, after all. So I opened a second https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333100/power-of-recall-revoking-elected-moderators-privilegesquestion on the general meta.se portal  in order to ask for a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_of_MPs_Act_2015well-known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_electionprocedure that could mitigate this risk. Given the higher abstraction level, the meta.meta.se looked the best context to post it. Right? Wrong. The second question has been first put on hold at first (voted off because "question's topic is only applicable to one specific site in the Stack Exchange Network."), deleted right after. So I moved the question back to arduino.meta as required by the meta.meta.se users/admins.
In the while time I privately contacted the community team but I got 2 messages from a bot and 1 from an ostrich (or an italian mafia guy: "Noooothing I'vve seeeeen, capisc'?", can't really tell what was on the other side). Then nothing more... anyway, I hope you're laughing. Cause this wall of text is huuuuuge and we need to relax sometimes. Back to work: at this point of time I want to think that the ostrich sent a signal to the Almighty Community Team, and the Benevolent Community Team had a chat with https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4143/majenkothe moderator that had closed my arduino.se question. Sweet dreams are melodies...
The moderator attempted an answer here on this arduino.meta.se question, missing the whole point like many other users did: the point is not "why" he put on hold my original question, but the act of deleting the question instead of make it clear why he put that on hold; we are 1 step ahead now. We are at demanding the "power of recall", not let me post my question. Anyway: his off-topic, and rationale-less typing has been recorded, and his effort/time appreciated. It should be appreciated, at least: many commenters on meta.meta.se insisted that by not having the original question, they couldn't judge the situation because the other side of the story was missing. That's why judicials can't be taken at large: judging at large easily becomes lynching. Anyway, now we have https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2625/59304the other side of the story; long story short: when I posted the second comment insisting on comparing the on-topic list with my case, he decided it was not worth discussing with me, and deleted the question just for fun. Basically he doesn't want to accept arduino.se rules (on-topic list and code of conduct) and instead of talking to other moderators and community managers in order to change the rules he doesn't like, he first harass the users and then delete their questions in order to not be questioned. Because whoever discuss his moderation "is just one of those many whiners like you, he met in his long time here in SE" (rephrased to shorten). Honestly yesterday I granted him the benefit of the doubt. Now his intention is declared instead. I know many politicians, some cops, and all the judges I know, having the same attitude. And criminals as well: "Your Hoooonor! Please, let's forget about the past and be friend all togheter!". That's why long time ago the Magna Charta was bloodily requested and unwillingly signed...
The best thing to do would be to undelete both the previous questions, and edit those; in order to not loose the history; but I don't have the privilege, the ostrich is busy, and the moderator would like to be an ostrich. So, in order to avoid the same confusion many users did yesterday, I've split the two issues in two separate questions, as reccomended by some users/admins in the 2-days, multiple-threads, discussion: I leave here on arduino.meta.se the meta-discussion on the deleted arduino question, and open https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333127/do-we-need-power-of-recall-to-avoid-moderator-abusesa new meta-question on meta.meta.se strictly tailored on the more general topic of the "power of recall" procedure that could benefit the entire SE network. 




Given the previous events:

- can my question be undeleted so I can slightly update instead of opening a new one working around the previous issue?

- because this single issue isn't that important after all, can we now (after the moderator expressed his side of the story) focus on the real topic (the need of a "power of recall") so that these obnoxious abuses and the following excruciating discussions can be reduced making SE a bit better than already is now?

Thank you.



WORK IN PROGRESS. STUFF TO BE MOVED BACK TO meta.meta.se

(Original question posted on meta.meta.se, I couldn't move it back there)

I've just been the victim of a wrong moderation decision. Before going to the point, I try to summarize my case because it is the perfect case study for requesting the introduction of the "power of recall" in Stack Exchange. Long story (short, if you read bold words only):


Arduino Stack Exchange, I post my first question (note: the question is deleted, the link can't be accessed) about how to program a variant of the companion chip that comes on some arduino boards. The original arduinos come with an USB-serial converter from the company FTDI, arduino clones instead come with any cheaper chip can do the job (usually CH340). I swapped the onboard CH340C chip with a CH340B variant, making it a different arduino clone. The change I made is exactly the same change between an original Arduino NanoV3 (with FTDI chip) and my unbranded NanoV3 clone (with CH340C chip). Actually, by swapping the "C" variant with the "B" variant I basically re-added a functionality that the original board have and the clone (with "C" variant chip) doesn't. I called mine Frankenuino NanoV3, clone (with CH340B chip). Nothing fancy has been added or removed from the clone board.
after a couple of minutes moderator Majenko put the question on hold for being off-topic. So I went to check the on-topic page because, being a new user, I had the doubt to really be off-topic and wanted a better understanding of my wrongdoing. But I've found to be perfectly on-topic: "On topic: Specific questions about Arduino boards, ..., clones/counterfeits/derivatives" (quoted from the on-topic page just linked). Note that the arduino stack exchange covers the whole board (ie: not the main chip only) AND the clones (ie: not the original arduino only). So I couldn't follow the first part of the guideline on the closed question page: "Consider editing the question or leaving comments for improvement if you believe the question can be reworded to fit within the scope.", because the question was already well inside the scope. But I could follow the second part about asking in the comments to the moderator why the question had been closed



  @Majenko Why did you tag this question as off-topic? "On topic:
  Specific questions about Arduino boards, ...,
  clones/counterfeits/derivatives" (
  arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic ). The USB-serial converter is
  part of the board and strictly needed to access that kind of board.


and he had replied


  No, the Arduino software and the MCU on the board are on topic. What
  makes you think we would know anything about custom programming of a
  proprietary chip that is not used on any official Arduino boards? If
  there is no tool in apt or on github then you're probably stuffed.


This is evidence that the moderator didn't read/understand the on-topic page (where it is clearly stated "board" instead of "the MCU only", and "clones" instead of "official Arduino boards"), or is involved in some kind of copyright/patents devoted religion, or simply doesn't pay attention when reading. In any case, the moderator doesn't fit the role.

So I insisted:


  @Majenko did you read the on-topic definition page before closing
  questions like this? I quoted the page in the previous comment. 1) It
  says "board" not "AVR MCU", 2) It explicitly says
  "clones/counterfeits/derivatives". In other words you are not allowed
  to close this question. Please vote for re-open.


And he simply... deleted the question.

As a result:


By closing the question he denied me the chance to partecipate to Stack Exchange.
By not accepting discussion, he denied Stack Exchange (ie: us all) the chance to have better moderation by having moderators that know the common rules we all have.
By deleting the question I've lost the time I've spent to produce it. Because I've lost access to it: I can't discuss further, I can't link it to another context, and as soon as I close the browser page I'll loose that text for ever.


It's a sluggish form of censorship very common nowadays in many different contexts, and always unacceptable.

Now, because Stack Overflow is run by me (together with you all) by public elections and increasing the hierarchy depth (user->moderator->super moderator->mega super moderator->and so on...) is an endless game that increase costs, never solve 100% of the issues forcing the introduction of more depth in the hierarchy in order to refine the selection process for moderators, I'd like to see the introduction of "power of recall" in Stack Exchange in a similar way it has been done in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 2015: "proceedings are initiated only if an MP is found guilty of a wrongdoing that fulfils certain criteria".

So there's the need to define such criteria to define "wrongdoing". The first criteria that should be taken into consideration is the one I violated here: privacy, the name of the misbehaving moderator, OR his wrongdoing, shouldn't be known. Because the goal is not to lynch someone; the goal is to improve the community. But it is not our case study.

The second criteria that should be took into consideration in all reputation-based information systems is about the Freedom of Speech: "if, after a mistake, the moderator enact another privileged action in order to conceal the previous mistaken privileged action, and by doing so denying himself a chance to learn and preventing any chance of further investigation by the community for the community". And this is our case study: by deleting the question, the damage increased, instead of giving us the chance to understand what's on-topic and what's off-topic.

That's just a draft. And there might be further criteria that can automatically trigger a recall procedure. The point I'm trying to do is that there must be a way to get rid of people unfit for the role, in the same way there is one to elect them in that role. So, if you are willing to keep going with moderators election, you must introduce a way to make those moderators think twice and more in general to make them a better moderation class.

Because the general public can't be expert of a single topic (in our case "arduino"), there must be a procedure to vote the moderator off, accessible by all the users (over 100 reputation?) of that portal only. In our case study is pretty simple as the on-topic page clearly states what's on-topic, but in some cases there could be the need of more peculiar knowledge. And the users of a single stack exchange portal are the only one supposed to understand the issue.

1) Feature request: Who do I have to write this note to? Any advices? Toughts?

2) Solving my issue on arduino portal: I'll try to re-post exactly the same question. But I guess it will be censored again. This is what the "unfit administrators" usually do. Is there any other existing procedure I didn't find in my investigations?

Update1: this is not a duplicate of question n.28867. That question is asking what options exist already. I'm asking if a particular procedure can be implemented in the (near?) future. Moreover, my concerns are not only about my single case - as I can ask questions in other contexts (ex: arduino forum) - it's about making stackexchange better, and in particular prevent moderator abuses. Low quality moderators bring to users leaving stackexchange in search of better options.

Update2: some user noted in the comments that a recall procedure already exists. But 1) The procedure can be initiated by moderators and the company team only, the victims are excluded from the chance to initiate the trial, 2) there's no jury for decision making, again: the potential victims are excluded from the trial, 3) there's no guarantee that the trial will be properly anonymized and then published (the minutes could be published IF undefined needs arise). 4) there's no accessible archive of previous judgments. In general: someone could even question the existance of this procedure, because there's no way for the community to access it before, during, or after.

Update3: some users noted in the comment that the question is off-topic, and it isn't:

If your question is about:

- Stack Exchange 
...
- Support, feature requests, or bug reports for the core Stack Exchange engine that powers all Stack Exchange websites

… it is welcome here.

( https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic )


Update4: it looks like many commenters aren't reading the title, or can't understand the issue. From the comments: "you keep saying that a moderator is unqualified for deleting one of your questions". This is spam: I challenge anyone finding me asking even once to remove the delete privilege from moderator's role. Please avoid commenting without reading, or driven by reasons different from contributing to the solution of the issue in question.

There is a way of contact the Community Managers who are the ones that manage moderators. I think the form https://arduino.stackexchange.com/contacthere goes to them.

See also https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/151606/handling-calls-to-remove-a-moderatorHandling Calls to Remove a Moderator and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28867/what-recourse-do-i-have-if-i-believe-a-moderator-has-abused-their-privilegesWhat recourse do I have if I believe a moderator has abused their privileges?.

I do not think you are completely powerless here. Those links outline the process for dealing with problems with moderators.

Your question was blatantly off topic. 

If you buy a Dongfeng car and rip out the factory installed stereo, then buy a Fony™ stereo and fit it yourself, would you then go to a Ford dealership to ask how to tune the stereo to your favourite station?  No.  You'd get laughed all the way down the road.

You do NOT presume to dictate to us what wuestions we are and are not allowed to close.  I have met many many people like you in my time here. You live to complain (as evidenced by the fact that your "complaint" question is far more detailed than your actual question...!)

Off topic is off topic is off topic. No amount of complaining on your part will change that. The moment it became apparent that it was the start of a long, drawn out whine by you, I deleted the question. I refuse to get into arguments with moaners like you about what is and is not on topic, when what you are asking is blatantly off topic.

Be glad it was only the question I deleted. 

I can guarantee that, if I hadn't closed the question, within a matter of minutes it would have been closed as "off topic" anyway by others - because it was off topic. 100% off topic.


  "Queri ego cogito ergo sum"

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So much text, and no reasons why it was off-topic. I ask you again: did you read the list of on-topic items for the arduino SE? I don't dictate anything: I've no provileges to enforce my words! My naked keyboard only! That page instead, passively does. Those kind of pages are called "rules", and are published in order to make clear in advance what can be done and what not. Here there are multiple pages like that, example: the code of conduct page. And you should read them all before deciding yourself alone to declare war to arduino clones, or put-down someone that complaints of you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can I put it more simply: The CH340B and its internal workings are not on topic. Programming said chip through its external interface is off topic. Just because you stuck it to an Arduino does not make it magically on topic for an Arduino site.  It *may* fit on the Electrical Engineering SE site, but it is NOT on topic here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dude, on arduino.se there are 2 pages of questions tagged CH340. The B/C/T/S/M... chip have the same CH340 datasheet. I've some of those Nano with the CH340B on them (that's why I bought more). I bought some Dongfeng cars and they sent me some with blue stereo LEDs and some with red stereo LEDs, so I went to a mechanic shop with a big blinking sign outside "Dongfeng car repairs HERE" asking to change the red leds into blue leds. Does it sounds good to you?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, and NONE of them have anything to do with the internals of the chip and programming it. Using it as part of an Arduino and getting it to work WITH ARDUINO, fine. Using the chip itself? NO!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyway, your answer doesn't answer the question. The question advices a well known method for recalling elected administrators, requests for comments and wheter or not is possible to introduce something similar in SE. You are off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You see, this is exactly why I deleted the question. Whatever anyone says will be wrong. You are right, and everyone else is wrong. I refuse to argue with you - it is pointless. The question is off topic. Final answer. DO NOT ARGUE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dude, again: that chip (and its internals) is ON-BOARD! And the on-topic list clearly says "board" not "MCU". This SE is called "Arduino" (board), not "AVR MCUs". Please stop jumping from the branding issue to the board/mcu issue, and back. They exist in your mind only, as they both are well placed in the scope of arduino.se. Look: the FTDI chip on the original arduinos have the same features of the CH340B. And same of you FTDI made a campaign to discredit their competitors! They even developed a virus to break the CH340 chips and pushed it as driver for CH340 chips! You are doing the same...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I refuse to engage with you any more. You just won't take no for an answer. Goodbye.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"I refuse to engage with you any more." I'm glad you wrote openly. Because that's exactly the abuse of privileges that makes you an admin bad enough to need the "power of recall". To make a mistake is fine and human; I do at least one minor and one major every day. To refuse to discuss a potential mistake instead is unacceptable. To delete the traces of the mistake is the worst you could do. When you don't want to discuss any more - and in this case you have to, because you have some responsibilities; I don't, I've due diligence only; you do - you can simply stop writing. Deleting is too much


















I would like to chip in my support for the Arduino Stack Exchange moderators (both past and present). They are volunteers who donate their time to keep this stack exchange running and spam free for all of us to enjoy. A heartfelt thank you.

@Anichang I would have voted that your question was off-topic if it was in a review queue. Granted, you were modifying an Arduino clone by replacing a chip with another (more advanced) chip, but the question you ask is how to create a Linux command line tool that lets you access the advanced features of the new chip. It wasn't really about the Arduino clone - it was about programming the advanced features of a new chip only.

If you had of asked about using the Arduino clone, programming a sketch into the Arduino clone or a problem you were experiencing using the Arduino clone that didn't happen with a standard Arduino, then it would be on topic.

A good way to test if a question is about Arduino is to remove the Arduino references from the question. If the question still makes complete sense and the references to Arduino don't add any value to the question, then it is off topic.

If you had of asked how you could identify your Arduino clones on your USB hub, then that would have been on topic.

It is very likely that in the current form your question would have been closed as off topic by the community. Like the moderators, we volunteer our time to answer people's questions about Arduino.

Instead of the long post you put up here (and on Meta.SE) because you disagreed with your post being closed, imagine the good you could have done if you had of put the same amount of effort into answering some of the Arduino questions here.

Moreover, the moderator made clear that his concern is about branding, ie: it's a copyright/trademark/branding crusade - it's censorship - not a well placed reasoning making spam of my question about a derivative board. Please, as I stated, don't add more off-topic answers. I kept this question on hold until a reasonable way to remove admins by the people, for the people, has been added.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5About donating time for no-profit activities: I'm not questioning the good hearted behaviours. I, myself, created my account as I felt to owe something to SE community after about 10 years of finding solutions on these pages. Check my history: I created the account to help others. My first question was after I answered a few questions, and was just a way to figure out how the system works. Unfurtunately, my final evalutation is: no worth using SE to help others, because it lacks the same features lacking on all the other modern "socials". Tried, dumped.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is clear that you just want to argue and not take on any feedback whatsoever.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's obvious: it's a Q/A system! And this is the meta side of it: Q about the Q/A system, ends in itself. Pure arguing. More in general, plenty functional illiterates complaint of others not listening/reading/accepting other's opinions; it's pretty common nowadays. Many go searching for "Communication for dummies" or more fancy Schopenhauer's "Die Kunst, Recht zu behalten". Instead of refine their reasoning. I can't know wheter you didn't read or you didn't understand, in any case your discussion points have all been exposed before you posted. There was no need for you to write answers.



















  There is a flag/close/offtopic because/This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network option, but StackOverflow is not mentioned as possible candidate.


If you are referring to the "Flagging > Closing > Off-Topic > Migration" window, I believe users with the required reputation can "see" this option but can't select a site to "migrate to". If the user can't select an option, then this option should not be displayed. Let's give the other moderators some time to see this question and hear what they know/have to say about this issue.


  So far I flag the question and ask a moderator to move, but what is the preferred solution?


Flagging the question and asking a moderator to move it is the preferred solution. Arduino SE moderators may discuss questions with the other SE network moderators before we migrate a question to them.

I'm a little opposed to questions being migrated on technicalities, however if it has to be done, then flagging for a moderator to do it is the way. If the question had contained an Arduino function call, then it might have been more ambiguous as to whether it belonged here or not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Shouldn't the "flag/close/offtopic because/This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network option" include the ability to choose another SE site? I seem to have the rep to point questions to the meta site, but not to an actual destination site. Given that close requests take several consensus votes before they actually take effect, this seems like it should let the voter pick a suggested destination SE site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DuncanC - One possible solution would be to Vote to Close with the Off-Topic reason, then flag the question with "in need of moderator intervention". Please let us know which site you would like it migrated to. I'm "pretty sure" that close votes are removed during the migration process, but you still should retain your "close vote count".


















"This is not a free code service."

"Do your own research/coding!"

"Have you ever tried googling this?"

This are the response users might get for some questions, I'm a user of this sub for some time now and I know some users don't even bother (or don't know how to give a proper explanation because English is not their first language) to ask the question clearly and/or they just paste some code/error.

Three month ago I didn't know anything about Arduino and C++ in general, now I have a medium knowledge to do my own projects.(Thanks to Majenko, Chris, Michel, Juraj and everyone else in this sub.)

I was looking at my questions today and those questions which answered with a working example in it helped me more to understand the coding principle about that specific question in details, for example https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/67150/ds18b20-with-only-onewire-libraryThis question. (I can't appreciate enough the time and effort chris put on answering that question.)

So i can not disagree more with this:


  If you give 'them' an straight answer they will never learn anything. they have to do their own research.


If I didn't have a piece of working code I could never be able to "play" with the code and learn how it works...

I mean no one is getting paid to answer questions here, therefore there is no pressure to answer any question.

Even though I know just a little about Arduino yet sometimes I do have an answer for some simple questions but since I don't like the feeling of getting a down vote I don't post the answer and just comment the answer. https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/68933/i-want-to-print-onto-serial-monitor-when-its-detected-the-value-change#comment149247_68933Example.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An straight answer or just guidance?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj what she (I'm sure she also disagrees with "open borders") describes in that "article" is not gonna happen here because like Majenko answer not everyone are willing to help the "vampires" they are individuals who just seeking help. they choose SE over other free services like reddit, google etc (isn't that what most companies want?). my point is please don't down-vote the person who is willing to help the "vampires" it's his choice...


















Personally I am strongly opposed to people answering in a comment under the question. This totally goes against the design of Stack Exchange. The comments under questions are supposed to be to clarify the question, to get more information, like what board they are using, and what the hardware being connected is, exactly.

See https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commentHelp Center > Privileges > comment everywhere



  When shouldn't I comment?
  
  Comments are not recommended for any of the following:
  
  ...
  
  Answering a question or providing an alternate solution to an existing answer; instead, post an actual answer (or edit to expand an existing one);


As that post says, comments are temporary. So, your "comment answer" might go away, thus depriving future people of the benefit of your wisdom. Also, you lose the chance to get reputation when people vote your answer up.

And, comments tend to be sequenced in upvotes-for-the-comment order, which can make them look like nonsense when read later on.

The whole design is for people to make answers (not comments) so that the answers can be voted on, and then future people can choose, if they wish, the highest-voted answer.

You are losing the chance to gain rep if you are timid about posting answers. Say "to hell with it" and post your answer. Maybe some will be voted down, but in most cases the up-votes will compensate.



As for "do your own research" ... pffft! We are supposed to be answering questions here, not doing passive-aggressive "find out for yourself" answers.

When I see a question I answer it. If it looks like a homework question I would post a partial answer and say something like "I'll let you handle the other inputs yourself, based on my examples".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Personally I am strongly opposed to people answering in a comment under the question." The unwritten policy of "Don't give them an straight answer" *might* prevent new users to provide an answer and if they do give an answer they'll do it in comment section to avoid getting down-votes. I'm glad one of the oldest member of this sub agrees with me about not having a "rule" like this. thank you.


















I see two kinds of question that fit into this category:


I want to do this. Give me the code and circuit.


No. I won't. I'm not going to spend my time and effort writing your software and designing your circuit for no reward. Zero effort has been shown by the OP, so zero effort will be given by me/us.


I am trying to do this, but I don't know how to begin.


By all means we'll help you begin. If you have examples that you need us to help you understand, that's fine. If you need help understanding the datasheet, that's fine. As long as you've taken that first step of at least looking at an example and trying to understand it, then we'll help you. 

In short: "Give me code" - no. "Help me understand" - yes.

Fortunately for you your questions fit into the second category, not the first. So you generally get our help.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"I want to do this. Give me the code and circuit. 'No. I won't.' ". That's ok it's a free service and you choose to answer the questions you like. but what if someone wants to write the code for the guy? can we not hammer (down-vote) the person which is not seeking a "reward"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@newbie if we breed the expectation that this is a free code writing service then people will get upset when they don't get help when the one guy doing the code writing doesn't want to handle their question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ratchetfreak they'll get "upset" anyway, I'm not saying we sit there and write free code for the people. what I'm saying is there's no need to down vote an answer which is from someone who willingly wrote a free code.


















https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/391832/we-re-lowering-the-close-reopen-vote-threshold-from-5-to-3-for-goodThis SO Meta 'question' announces lowering of the close/reopen vote threshold from 5 to 3 on Stack Overflow.

The answer to a question in a comment if it applies to other SE sites is https://webapps.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4687/cancelling-election-lets-try-something-else-testing-three-vote-question-closthis link, but it doesn't really have the answer.

Do our moderators have more informations? Can we have a threshold of 3 votes?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we change the close/reopen vote threshold from 5 to 3?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are a lot of 1st time posters who may take getting their question closed the wrong way and just leave for good.  I would be in favor of reducing the number of votes but only if the votes were accompanied by a (good) posted comment against the question voted to be closed.  If possible, I would even favor weighting the close votes.  Close votes with no attached comment = 1/5 votes needed to close.  Close votes with an attached comment = 1/3 votes needed to close.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@st2000, Stack Exchange changed the 'notices' about closing reason https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/12/05/new-post-notices-improving-feedback-on-stack-overflow-questions/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@st2000, there are never 5 close votes here on Arduino SE. usually moderator must help to close the garbage questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the improvements in the linked-to stackoverflow blog.  I did not see where it addresses situations where people vote to close questions with no feed back to the original poster.  While I don't think it is fair to demand feed back, I do think rewarding it is fair game.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@st2000 - Every "On Hold" and "Closed" post always gave "feed back to the original poster". The wording of the reasons for on hold / closure has recently changed, and the background color changed from yellow to blue https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/12/05/new-post-notices-improving-feedback-on-stack-overflow-questions/ I believe comments are still active when a question is put on hold, and can be transferred to chat for an extended conversation. Comments / chat can be used to clarify the exact nature of the issue(s) with the question. A person voting to close can leave a comment if they choose.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO, when will the change happen?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - The "test" I'm told started in January, and we should hear something after the end of the month. If we haven't heard anything by the middle of February, I will contact SO. This is a feature we really need. Most people are unaware that votes to close "age away" after 5 days. Let's say we get 4 VTC on a question, a week goes by, and voila, there are 0 VTC. This aging away of votes is OK for a busy network like EE, but for us it doesn't work very well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO here are 4 close votes https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/71686/is-it-permissible-to-use-strlcpy-to-copy-an-array-to-itselfb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://arduino.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=Close&daterange=last7daysb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO, the "Arduino uno wifi rev2 stuck inside loop." needs guidance, not solving. the OP asked more questions with the same sketch. some of them have accepted answersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the strcpy question is extremely common. the OP didn't try to google itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO, something new?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the community here is still quite small with only 177 users having 500+ reputation so they are able to cast close votes. How many questions are in the queues? Is it too much for moderators to get involved?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ThomasWeller - I agree. And out of the 177, very few of those users "get involved". There may be 20 regular users who participate in these "maintenance" tasks. IMHO, giving the community the ability to close questions at 3 votes, rather than 5 votes, gives them more control, not less. I am in favour of this proposed change.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ThomasWeller - There is a possibility that 3 users could join forces to abuse this new privilege (if we are approved for it). A simple flag for moderator attention by any user is all that's required to start an investigation (I sure hope users with 1 rep can flag a post). Whether 5 or 3 people voted to close a question, a single moderator vote can reopen it at any time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO: I doubt it would be abused. Flagging is possible with 15 rep, which is indeed low. Unfortunately, new users won't know that this option exists and it's the right way to go. In other forums (non-SE), flagging is mostly considered as a harmful action like removing the post due to copyright violation, violence or similar.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO, something new?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - Nothing new.

There have been a lot of "changes" at SE lately, so I know they have been very busy. Thanks for your patience.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - Have a look at the "older questions" section of this document: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/345032/community-and-moderator-guidelines-for-escalating-issues-via-new-response-proces.

We still need the 3 vote to close to be implemented.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO, we have 3 vote close. they left it active even the test was planed to end in June. https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2681/3-vote-close-hows-it-going


















I have some information regarding the process of changing the "close/reopen vote threshold".


We need a question on our meta site that discusses the merits of changing the required number of close and reopen votes.
Options are 5 votes, or 3 votes, or 1 vote.
Once our users have talked it through, we can get a one-month test started.


Let's see what our users and other site moderators have to say (we are all in different timezones).

In the mean time, how about an anonymous survey for the Arduino SE users. Please up vote one of the following comments you agree with.



Update 2020-02-04.

I spoke with a SE employee about this proposed change, and ask for your patience while they work through higher priority tasks. While we are waiting, there are some things we can do as a community:


Use the "Flagging" system to bring "problem" questions to the
moderators attention. Before I was elected as a moderator, I raised
640 flags in 640 days (35 were declined). If you see something wrong,
don't be afraid to flag it.
Vote to Close the question. You don't have to use the "canned
reasons". Select "off topic" then "other" to give us a description of
why you think the question should be closed.
Down vote the question. It doesn't "cost" you any rep, and it sends a
clear message to the community about the perceived value of the
question.
If you have the rep, and feel strongly about a question, do all of
the three previous suggestions.




Update 2019-12-11. Our site has been scheduled to have the test started some time in January. I’ll update this answer as more information becomes available.

Update 2020-01-13. There are 2 comments to Juraj’s question that should be discussed.


  The first comment is regarding this Q+A:
  https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/71686/is-it-permissible-to-use-strlcpy-to-copy-an-array-to-itselfIs it permissible to use strlcpy to copy an array to itself?.


Right now it has a score of -3, with 4 Votes To Close (VTC). The question includes a sketch that compiles, however, it’s subject matter is a basic C++ question. As a user of Arduino SE, I dis-agree with closing the Q+A. As a moderator, I was elected to work for the community, so I will give it the 5th VTC. As a user, I’m sorry to say this to the 4 people who VTC, but I’m up-voting the question to try to give the OP some rep back, and I’m up-voting Edgar’s answer because he gave a great answer as usual. Unless this question gets up to at least 100 views in 5 days, the community robot will permanently delete it from the system.


  The second comment deals with other questions. One of them has 3 VTC
  and the other has 2 VTC. Regarding the 3 VTC:
  https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/71290/how-can-i-get-the-esp32-to-be-a-webserver-in-addition-to-other-thingshttps://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/71290/how-can-i-get-the-esp32-to-be-a-webserver-in-addition-to-other-things.


It has a score of -1 (I gave it the -1 before the OP make 2 edits to improve it). The last comment indicates the OP is still "working on it", so I will VTC. This question can still be edited and will show up in the Reopen Votes: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/reviewhttps://arduino.stackexchange.com/review. Of course, any user, can leave a comment on any question, (or flag it) at any time, and say "I have an answer. Please re-open the question".


  The question with 2 VTC:
  https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/71511/arduino-uno-wifi-rev2-stuck-inside-loopArduino uno wifi rev2 stuck inside loop.


I can see the OP is a "New contributor" to our network, so extra patience is expected from our community. There seems to be multiple languages used here (English, German, Dutch). Arduino SE is an "English" site, however, we have a global audience with users who speak everything except English. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to teach yourself another language, just so you could ask for help on the Arduino SE network.

Some of the things I don’t like about this Q+A. There is a lot of discussion in the question’s comments. The comments should be moved to chat, which I will do. The use of the additional languages creates extra work for the community. I used Google Translate to verify that none of the comments, code comments, and language in the image were offensive (in English).

For now, I’ll add this question to my list, and watch for further VTC. If we are approved for the 3 VTC proposal, then one more VTC will close it. I won’t like it, but if that is the wishes of the community, so be it.

It's New Year's Day in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_TimeStack Exchange land...

A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:


  We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
  -- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation


While there certainly are https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/Moderators here, a significant amount of the moderation is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.

As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together. 
And what could be more festive than a big pile of numbers? 
So here is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on Arduino over the past 12 months:

Footnotes

¹ "Community" here refers both to https://arduino.stackexchange.com/usersthe membership of Arduino without https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsdiamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/-1user #-1.

² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.

³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-userGenerally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.

⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.

⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes).

⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.

⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

I left you a test message in the Pin 13 chat room.


  and the question wizard requires some more text


What is the "question wizard"?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it was just a dummy text because so short question is not allowedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5still frozen. the field to enter a new message is missing. I added a screenshot to question


















A simple one really: 


What is the most important thing you look for when choosing an Arduino-compatible development board?


Do you even look for anything specific, or do you just automatically plump for the "default"? Is there any specific feature set you need? Is size important? Price? Processing power? Memory? IO pin count?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A little survey (for those that can be bothered to read Meta)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your question is not quite clear to me Arduino-compatible development board means can be programmed via ArduinoIDE / is a clone of the official Arduino boards/designs or it can be used with the Arduino C++ flavour to be programmed with. So is an ESP32cam an Arduino compatible boardb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, anything that can be programmed through the Arduino IDE and bought off the shelf. So sure ESP32 cam is included.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess I'd say "_it depends on what's needed for the project_", but that's not really an answer.


















I search for maximum features I need for the project and minimum features I don't need.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great answer. +1. Personally, I only build things that are "smart enough" to do the job that they were designed to do. For example, why pay for WiFi if you don't need it. No one can "hack" the WiFi on a Pro Mini because it doesn't have it "built in".


















I usually use fenced code blocks in order to get code
syntax-highlighted, as in
```c++
some C++ source
```

This used to work for quite some time. However, since a couple of days
or so, it looks like it doesn't work anymore.
Examples: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/76446/7508here and https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/76397/7508here.
The weird thing is: while editing, the syntax highlighting does work in
the preview... sometimes!
Did I do something wrong? Is this feature deprecated? Is it just a
glitch in the Matrix?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is syntax highlighting broken?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e52020-06-17: Arduino Stack Exchange was migrated to CommonMark. use ```cpp


















I removed the c++ in the first question, and now the syntax highlighting is working.
If it worked before (with the c++), my best guess is Stack Exchange made some changes in the back end.
There is another way to force syntax highlighting for all code blocks in a particular Q or A.
<!-- language-all: lang-cpp -->

There is more information here: https://stackoverflow.com/editing-helpMarkdown help, and according to this page, the c++ should work.
Clearly there is something wrong or something changed. I'll see what I can find out...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! I knew about this option, but I find it somewhat clumsy. I prefer fenced code blocks and have been using them since I noticed stackexchange started supporting them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might also need to add a space **``` cpp** - it's another commonmark thing


















Yes, but what language? Your examples shows two: C++ and bash.
Some code blocks show output from the terminal monitor which should not (generally) be coloured at all.
If you tag your question with the C++ tag that it gets the C++ (ie. Arduino) colouring automatically.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was just thinking we by default do Arduino (C++) syntax highlighting, and require manually setting it for anything else. Alternatively, I suppose we could just tag every question with Arduino code in it with the `C++` tag? Or, what is preferred?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some people even post (ugh.....) python.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One thing that I have often wondered about... do the question tags affect the syntax highlighting in *answers*...?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It appears to, yes. See [here](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/77289/arduino-expected-before-delay) as an example. Neither the question nor the answer have the special "language" comments, but both are syntax-highlighted (and the question has the C++ tag).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*What is preferred?* - I usually tag questions with code in them with the C++ tag, but have been ticked off in the past because the "question is not about C++". Perhaps, but if it has C++ code in it I think the tag is reasonable. After all, people who want to (or are able to) answer questions about C++ syntax may well search for such tags.


















It is with great sadness that we have to say goodbye to VE7JRO in the moderator team. We thank him for the sterling work he has done during his tenure as moderator and wish him all the best.
As a result a moderator election will shortly be called. If you think you might be able to fill his shoes, watch this space.

No. The main site is not a place for soliciting feedback for projects - it is a place for obtaining help with specific problems you may be having.
There's nothing stopping you asking on Meta - though the audience is considerably smaller, so the results may be pretty meaningless.

If anyone knows of any more (the more obscure the better, even if it's just for one single board) please let me know in answers / comments.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Arduino IDE boards master listb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://github.com/per1234/ino-hardware-package-listb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj Oooh, nice find. Thanks for that one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course it will take some work going through all those looking for the links to the board installation JSON file where available. Many are grouped into a single file, like the Adafruit ones...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did know about this list. Per is very active in Arduino community mainly on Arduino forum and recently he even started to work for Arduino. He writes documentation (CLI afalk). But he avoids Arduino SE for some reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, it's a great resource. Basically I'm looking to (eventually) migrate UECIDE to using (at least sometimes) `arduino-cli` as the compilation back-end, and want to have a way of selecting the boards / cores without you having to go hunting for them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the CLI has boards manager services too. and it can run as RPC server (daemon)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. But you still need to know the JSON file URLs. That's what I want to avoid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the json links, right. there is no index of then anywhere. they are always mentioned in readme onlyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj Yeah. That file you link to has many of them, but not all. And some are b0rken too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this one? For Sanguino: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lauszus/Sanguino/master/package_lauszus_sanguino_index.json. I think that's for a 3D Printing board, I think, can't remember, I may have some others.


















My question is very related to:
https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2565/6-downvotes-in-6-days-what-am-i-doing-wrong6 downvotes in 6 days - what am I doing wrong?
However, I have 11 downvotes in about two weeks.
The answer given (I upvoted them), but seem not to be related to my questions because:

I'm not a newcomer at StackExchange
Most questions have (multiple) upvotes
For none, there is a reason added
Some of the questions are very old
I never had so many downvotes in such a short time (unless for a single question just asked, which I either removed or improved).

Meaning, it's not 'bad luck'. I just think it's somebody picking on me. Now I don't care if it cost me 20 or 100 points, but if he also downvotes other people who are new, they might cause people to stop using StackOverflow sites, and for me it was and still is an invaluable source of information.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e511 downvotes in a few weeks - what am I doing wrong?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the downvote on answer to syntax error question is my. it is only to zero the votes count so the question is deleted later by the system. the downvotes on your questions are not OKb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj I don't mind to have a downvote for a bad answer (actually it's good, keeping the quality high).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj do you mean the answer for https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/78013/the-error-shows-ir-sensor541-error-expected-unqualified-id-before-token/78014#78014 ? I think the answer is correct, but would fit better at StackOverflow. But in that case a change of the question and answer to that forum would be better, and not a downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5it would be off-topic on SO because it is a syntax error. so it is off-topic here too in my opinionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj Yes I agree, but then I rather would have it moved without downvoting as the answer is correct/helpful. I will flag the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5again. it is off-topic on SO. they will not accept the move. trivial questions must be off-topic on Q&A site. for example movie identification questions are off topic on Movies Stack Exchangeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj sorry know I know the issue, you mean questions about a syntax error should not be added at all... I will remove my answer and the question can be removed. Now I understand the downvoting. Thanks for the clarification.


















This question is probably a reaction to a comment I made on a (now deleted by the author) post, in which I said that comments under questions are not for answering questions.
I referenced this post: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19756/how-do-comments-workHow do comments work
Stack Exchange is not a forum and is not intended for ephemeral questions (like, "how do I fix this trivial issue") which are answered in comments and then deleted by the author. You can use a forum for that, and in particular https://forum.arduino.cc/The Arduino Forum.
Either one of two things will be true:

The question is a good question. It deserves an answer, and the question and answer(s) will stand to help people in the future. Like a knowledge-base. In this case make an answer. Other people may make different answers. People vote on the answers. The highest-voted answer will float to the top. The person asking the question will hopefully "accept" one of the answers.

The question is not a good question. It should not be answered in a comment. It should be downvoted, and eventually closed and deleted.


I have a Meta post https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2523/how-to-ask-a-good-question-for-arduino-stack-exchangeHow to ask a good question for Arduino Stack Exchange. You can reference that.
If the question is borderline useful (for keeping) then you can improve it yourself. Perhaps change from a very specific example to a more general example.
You could also make your own reference question that covers the points raised, but not the specific example, and explains in some detail how to resolve this particular point.

Attempts to answer in comments, and allow the user to delete the question, basically turn you into an unpaid consultant. No-one else is helped, because the question is then either deleted by the OP, or auto-deleted as you seem to be suggesting is a good idea.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Comments are used to ask for clarification or to point out problems in the post." the code could have other problem then the trivial one. the user didn't know it is a trivial question. I think it was a case o 'code blindness'. on comment the user fixed the problem pointed in the comment and there was no other problem. case closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Problems in the post" is different to the problem being posted about. A **problem in the post** would be grammar, spelling, punctuation, formatting of code, incomplete statement of the issue, not enough information and so on. This isn't referring to a "trivial problem being asked". If the problem is a missing semicolon in the code (say) then either make an answer pointing that out, or vote to close the question as being too trivial to be asked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the SO community didn't make the rule for fun. there is experience behind it. many times the trivial errors in code are only remains of debugging attempts and there is a real problem in the Question. so clearing trivial errors is clearing problems with the post. there should be no trivial errors in the post. if after clearing trivial problems there is no other problem, case closed. how many times OP doesn't write in wiring description that they have the grounds connected? do you want every time to write an answer about grounds not connected?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How many times do I have to say this, I wonder? As per [this Meta SO post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19756/how-do-comments-work) comments are **not for answering a question**. You can't spin that around and say that you can answer trivial questions in a comment. The whole model breaks down if you answer questions in comments. No-one can vote the "answer" down or up. No-one can suggest improvements to your "answer". If the question is really trivial **vote it down** - don't answer it. You are training people to use SE as a quick syntax-error solving forum.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't answer the question. I pointed out a trivial error in he code snippet. I can't know if it is the only problem since it is too obviousb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "No answer in a comment" rule is not optimally formulated (IMHO). In the case of trivial or low value questions it has the effect of forcing a formal answer, in the worst case, reams of text saying something blindingly obvious, or leaving the OP without any form of response until the question is automatically deleted. Neither are particularly satisfactory. Why not use the comment to give a response to help the OP say a quick fix, a more focused search phrase for the OP to try, or a recommendation for another forum. Maybe also including a signal to other potential responders and downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you are going to write 50 words as a comment to answer the question, I don't see the difference between typing the same 50 words into the answer box. Then the system considers the question answered, and we don't keep getting reminded a year or two later that this question doesn't have an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you think the question is hopelessly bad, don't answer, or vote it down, or flag it for migration or deletion. But don't answer it in the comments. It is explicitly disallowed [here](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment).


















User dannyf gets every day since October upvotes on three to five old answers. That makes around 2400 points in two months.
I flagged the last upvoted answer but the flag was declined maybe because my description of the problem was too short.

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
-- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation

That doesn't eliminate the need for having https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/moderators altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.
So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpgexciting stats. Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on Arduino over the past 12 months:

Footnotes
¹ "Community" here refers both to https://arduino.stackexchange.com/usersthe membership of Arduino without https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsdiamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/-1user #-1.
² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.
³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-userGenerally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.
⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.
⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes).
⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.
⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

In this instance I took the decision that the post was at home here and the post on the other site should be closed.
Just because a post exists on more than one site it doesn't always follow that this site should have the question closed.

I felt the one on ASE should be the one to stay since it was on topic here.


















Some of you may have noticed the Meta Stack Exchange post - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364007/testing-three-vote-close-and-reopen-on-13-network-sitesTesting three-vote close and reopen on 13 network sites (it's linked in the featured on meta sidebar) - we've finally got this project under way and Arduino is one of the sites we'll be running the test on.
Starting tomorrow, I'll be changing the site setting and closing and reopening will require only three votes. This test will run for 45 days and will be turned back to five votes to close and reopen while I review the data from the 13 sites. After we've seen the impact, I'll be posting results and, if there aren't negative impacts, we will change the setting to three permanently.
A few weeks into this, I'll be posting a question here on meta to ask for your thoughts about this change, so you will have an opportunity to discuss the impact.
Thank you so much for your patience while we got this prioritized and scheduled. There's a lot more information in the MSE post, so please review it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yes I noticed it. thank you. I am curios for the outcome of the test, because now we have more users with close voting privllege than year and a half back when I opened thisb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's good that y'all have more people with the privilege but I based this decision on your recent activity and y'all are handling less than half the questions that are flagged for closure - now, that could be because there's no one reviewing or because people are skipping a lot because they're not sure how to handle certain questions or any number of other things, so I'm hoping to capture some of that at the mid-test feedback opportunity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5back then it was completely hopeless to close a question without moderator :-)


















UPDATE: While the testing period has ended, this change has been well-received by the community so we have opted to not reset the votes needed to close/reopen to 5 while we look at data.
Please let me know if you have any concerns about this change in the planned process or if you feel the number of votes should be changed back at least temporarily. I'll be back in a few weeks with the results of the project.

Part of understanding the impact of three-vote closure is to understand what impact it's having on y'all. I'd like to ask anyone who feels up to it to write an answer to this question and to tell us about your experience over the past few weeks.
The sorts of things I'm interested in knowing (feel free to address all or none or add your own) -

Did this help?
Did it hurt?
Did it make you more interested in close/reopen reviewing? Less?

Are there things other than 3-vote close impacting your interest in reviewing?


If you can't vote but do flag, did this make you more/less likely to flag?
Would you prefer to go back to 5?
Should it be permanent?
What would you like me to look into when it comes to analyzing the data from the test?
Were there any side-effects (good or bad) that you want me to be aware of?

These are merely prompts, so feel free to add anything I'm missing that you think is worth saying. This is focused on how you're feeling about it and what data you want me to look at, so don't feel like you need to analyze the data over the last 30 days - though you're welcome to if that's how you figure out what you feel.
If you have any outstanding questions, also feel welcome to ask them here.
The test will run until about Monday the 21st of June, at which point we'll be resetting the votes to close up to 5 while I review the responses here and dig into the data that we've been collecting.

When a "sock puppet account" up-votes other users, they should at least have the common courtesy to ask the "up-voted user" whether or not they want the reputation, before they start up-voting them.
I have said publicly that the reputation on the Stack Exchange Networks has absolutely no value, unless collecting https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50480481#50480481fake internet points stimulates that part of your brain which https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_systemcraves it.
Please do not vote for my answers. I help people because I want to, not for the reputation. Last time I checked, Stack Exchange Reputation is NOT accepted at my local gas station, grocery store, or anywhere else in Canada.
FWIW, you can go to each user's public profile page and filter by "reputation" to see who lost the most rep. Here's a good place to start: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=allArduino Users.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I lost 10 reputation today. Our newest moderator, Juraj lost 510, Majenko lost 170. Who was the "deleted" user who was responsible?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5about voting: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/why-voteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5as I learned in Help Center there are two different messages: "User was removed" and "voting corrected". this time it is "User was removed"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - The about voting page says this "Voting is so important that there is a variety of badges associated with different aspects of voting – like casting your first upvote or downvote, using up all of your allotted votes in a day". I agree that there are not enough legitimate votes on this stack, and it's been a 4 year issue: https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2474/are-we-a-little-stingy-about-upvoting-questions With 17,570 votes to date, I am doing my part: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=allb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is this even troubling you? I lose 10 reputation every now and then, sometimes because an account is deleted, sometimes because someone disagrees with an answer I give, and sometimes because they don't like me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is what I posted on MathOverflow Meta: [Is it possible to know the list of removed users?](https://meta.mathoverflow.net/q/3629#3630) Briefly: If the user was deleted *after* the last update of SEDE, you can download the list of users from there and do the same next week (after the next update). If the user was removed before the most recent update, you won't find out from SEDE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Martin - Thank you very much for pointing me in the right direction. I've forked your query with minor modifications, and will re-run it next week and see if there is a change. Your answer on MathOverflow Meta is excellent, and should be required reading for every SE moderator. Arduino SE is a small stack, so using 15 rep and up returns far less records then the 50K limit. https://data.stackexchange.com/arduino/query/1440753/find-all-users-above-given-reputation?rep=15


















A "sock puppet" account is one which is literally controlled by the same person, like a puppet on your hand. So for example, if I made a second account called "John Gammon" (using a slightly different email address) and then whenever I made a post I got my "John Gammon" account to upvote it, that would be a sock puppet vote. Clearly that would be unethical, as no person, other than myself, was voting for it.
In that case, I would hardly need to get permission from myself to do the upvote, as it was me doing it.
However if a different person, Joe Bloggs, just happens to think I am wonderful and vote all my posts up, then this isn't a sock puppet vote. That is just an admirer. The Stack Exchange algorithm for detecting sock puppet votes might not be able to distinguish between the two, however.

Please do not vote for my answers. I help people because I want to, not for the reputation

That is certainly admirable to want to help people, however the whole idea behind Stack Exchange is that https://stackexchange.com/tourgood answers are voted up, and bad ones voted down. Asking people to not vote up your answers, if they are good, defeats that mechanism.
Next, you'll be asking people to not accept your answers, because that also gives you reputation. However accepting answers indicates that your answer solves their problem.
The up-vote is not so much to give you reputation (that is a side-effect) but to mark the answer as good and useful.

Who was the “deleted” user who was responsible?

I don't know the answer to that. Not even moderators can find that out. I suggest, though, that new users don't just go around voting hundreds of posts up willy-nilly. It might look to "the algorithm" that they are sock puppet votes.

You tagged this question "grow-up-se-rep-is-worthless". It isn't worthless — it is the basis of the entire system. Without reputation, you may as well have the to-and-fro of a forum. With a forum, it is hard to see which are the good answers and which are the rubbish ones. The reputation system (and the voting) is specifically designed to let third parties know whether they should trust one answer over another one.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Next, you'll be asking people to not accept your answers, because that also gives you reputation." - No, I won't be asking them to do that, and I never suggested it either. Where did you come up with that idea?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You said *Please do not vote for my answers. I help people because I want to, not for the reputation*. Well, if people accept your answers you get reputation. Apparently something you don't want.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, I did not say "please don't **accept** my answer, I said **Please re-read my first paragraph**. Those are two completely different things. Accepting answers closes questions which is a good thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Apparently something you don't want. " - Once again I must ask, where are you getting this from? Show me anything I have written that says I don't want to **earn** reputation for a good answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have a question about: "However if a different person, Joe Bloggs, just happens to think I am wonderful and vote all my posts up, then this isn't a sock puppet vote. That is just an admirer." When I read this page: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/serial-voting-reversed, it says "intentionally voting merely to reduce or inflate another user's reputation is considered abuse.". My interpretation is that voting for "...just an admirer" or "an admirer just voting for you" because they "like you", is a violation of the TOS with SE. Can you clarify this for me?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Once again I must ask, where are you getting this from?* - You said in your original question above: *Please do not vote for my answers. I help people because I want to, not for the reputation*. Your point is so obscure I don't understand it. You are asking people to not vote for your answers, but then you say you want to **earn** reputation? How, pray, are you going to earn reputation if you ask people not to vote for your answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Can you clarify this for me?* - yes I agree, if you collude with another user to vote each other's posts up, that may well be a violation of the TOS. However it is not a "sock puppet" as such. You can't usefully ask a sock puppet not to vote for you because the sock puppet is yourself. Unless you like talking to yourself. See [Sock Puppet Account - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account) - they define it as someone who operates a false account pretending to be someone else when they are really themselves under different names.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5RE: "how pray..." - You **earn** 15 rep when your answer is accepted, you **earn** 10 rep from an up-vote (from a honest user), you **earn** 2 from editing a post and those with rep for accepting an edit, etc. You can **earn** up to 1,000 rep without asking or answering a question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5RE: "Joe Bloggs" - In your example, let's assume you havs a 2nd account called Joe Bloggs, your sock puppet account. Joe Bloggs up votes your posts, but he **also** up votes other users posts (like mine). Maybe Joe Bloggs thinks this will hide what he is doing. The fact that all of the user's posts were deleted, all rep removed from all those up-voted, and the "stronger" message "User was removed", it is quite likely it is a sock puppet account. I remember a user who deleted their account (rage quit) during the period of time I was a moderator. SE kept all the posts and people kept the rep.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5RE: "just happens to think I am wonderful and vote all my posts up, then this isn't a sock puppet vote. That is just an admirer."  - Is it against the SE rules to up-vote a persons answer just because they admire them?


















It is impossible for us to know who the deleted user was. But "user was removed" is itself a very loose term.
It may have been a user that was deleted by the system for voting abuse. In general though users are deleted by a manual action by us moderators (destroyed as a spammer, for example) or manual intervention by the community moderators (our bosses).
It is far more likely that the user decided to delete their own account. Maybe a "rage quit" (we've all been there and done that) or just reducing their online presence.
As Nick has noted, reputation is less about personal reward and more about the smooth running of the site. Having to earn privileges through good questions and answers means that only people that have earned some level of trust gain access to more advanced features - which helps reduce abuse by new (or "sock puppet") users.
Voting for questions and answers is not about rewarding the users (the bounty system is for that, which you may notice is seldom, if ever, used), but about grading the quality of content. Once you have earned the amount of reputation you require to unlock the facilities you want there is little point to reputation from a personal perspective, but from the site's point of view the voting that creates that reputation is invaluable.
If people don't vote for your answers (because you told them not to) your answers won't be seen as good answers on the website, since others will have higher votes. Even if your answer is by far the best answer, if it's not been voted up that answer is of less worth (and less likely to be read) than a poorer answer.
In short: voting is the core principle these sites work on. Reputation is merely a side effect and a way of controlling new users' actions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just imagined the reputation hurricane if VE7JRO decides to delete his account because he doesn't like how the site worksb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - "hurricane"? That's funny, considering you were the person who lost the most rep (551) from the latest "purge" of fake votes. 551 rep in 30 days from one user to another must be considered excessive by the system, so I see why SE invalidated the rep. I have up-voted at least 132 of your answers over a period of several years, which is what, 1,320 rep? Doesn't sound like you would be affected too much by a VE7JRO exodus "hurricane".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Majenko - "but from the site's point of view the voting that creates that reputation is invaluable." -  I agree, and I do my part by voting, 17,570 times last time I checked: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=all The lack of legitimate voting seems to be a 4 year old issue with this stack: https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2474/are-we-a-little-stingy-about-upvoting-questions It's a shame that more "veterans" don't up-vote more. It would create a bigger pool of users with the ability to approve edits, vote to close, etc. Thank you for your answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO what 30 days? Invalidated rep has "voting corrected" (for example dannyf  Dec 9 2020)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - Part 1. The 30 days refers to the period of time when the majority of the lost reputation by a high percentage of the 2,000+ rep users on our network occurred. The removed user who cost you 500 rep yesterday: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/37622/juraj?tab=reputation&sort=post&page=1 may or may not be the same one you lost rep from on 2020-10-02: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/37622/juraj?tab=reputation&sort=post&page=3 To a regular user like myself, it's very likely the account was created a long time ago, and all of a sudden it is being used for nefarious purposes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - Part 2. The "fake votes issue" has been going on for a long time here on our stack, as you are well aware of. To refresh your memory, you said: https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50445713#50445713 and also said: https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/50479244#50479244 When you read the entire history of the Pin 13 chat, it would seem that you are the right person to figure out what's really going on here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - Part 3. I see the difference in the message I received "User was removed" and that of user dannyf "Voting corrected". If you read the definitions of each: https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/user-was-removed , https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/serial-voting-reversed , you'll see that "User was removed" is a serious offence, where as "voting corrected" says this "Should I be concerned about these correction statements on my profile?...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj - Part 4. "...No, not at all. It's only an indication of reputation change. After all, we can't control the actions of other users. It's very rare where we'd run across a user who was intentionally using votes to manipulate their own reputation, and most cases you would have already been contacted separately if we thought that was the case. As long as you're not intentionally abusing the system to manipulate someone else's reputation or your own, you do not have to worry about such entries - they're just an indication that the system is doing its job.".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@VE7JRO some time ago users could not delete their account. they had to request a mod to do it it. google search returns old meta answers on this topic. but now maybe because of the GDPR a user can delete their account.


















Based on the quality of some of the new question we see every day, some users think we collect trash here on Arduino SE. But we don't collect it all really. Stack Exchange system has a cleaning process nicknamed Roomba (as the robotic vacuum cleaner). Roomba deletes closed question without answer 10 days after asked. Roomba deletes unanswered questions with negative score 30 days after asked.
Today I made for me an overview of questions count based on close state, answered and score. There were 23764 questions total at that time. I used advanced search with queries like closed:yes answers:0 duplicate:no score:1..1.

Simply because an answer asking the OP to try something is not an answer - it is one of a stream of comments.
If you want clarification or for the OP to try something out and get back to you then you ask that in comments. Once the cause and solution has been "nailed" in the comments you can flesh that out into a proper answer.

That question was about compilation error which was solved by answer recommending to use .c_str().
The update turned the question into a troubleshooting case, which is not possible on a Q&A site. Sometimes we help troubleshot but not in answers but in comments. Your 'answer' is such a comment. If it takes many comments, then the session is moved to chat, which is more suitable because it can show source code.
If OP answers your comment, I will move the comments session to chat and you can do the troubleshooting there. But the question was asked 1 year, 4 months ago so I doubt OP still tries to solve this.

Before adding a new close reason, it must be consulted with the community. The new close reason would be "Not reproducible or was caused by a typo". It was already https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1276/can-we-have-a-no-longer-reproducible-close-reasondiscussed 6 years ago but there was no closure and I think I can't add the new close reason based on the old voting.
EDIT: Now questions which could use this close reason are closed with other reasons so this new close reason gives better explanation for the question poster.
Please vote on this post for this new close reason. You can share your thoughts about it in comments or as answer.
Stack Overflow has this close reason and I would use their texts:

It is a good and valid way of getting upvotes in the community.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Admittedly, it would not necessarily be helpful for others searching for answers. It would increase the hay to needle ratio.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sa_leinad, https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2667/trivial-questions-must-be-off-topic


















I was uncertain about this, however I must admit that https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/85845/programming-i2c-connected-lcd-screen-with-timer-wont-enter-timer-loopthis question is a good case in point. The problem was confusing = with == in code. This is not so much a typo as a misunderstanding of the C++ language, however if the question were to remain it would just be solving one person's coding problem, without really contributing to the general Arduino knowledge-base.
However I do have a problem with this:

This question was caused by a typo or a problem that can no longer be reproduced.

Surely they are widely different things? A typo is just a typing error, for example misspelling a word, using capitals in the wrong way, and so on.
A problem that can no longer reproduced is a totally different beast. You might try the posted code out and not reproduce the results the poster claimed. Surely this is something else? Maybe your environment, or hardware, was different?
Even the question I quoted above wasn't really a typo (unless you accidentally typed = instead of ==) but more likely to be a confusion about how C++ works compared to, say, SQL.
How about three close reasons? :)

A typo (eg. mistyping float as flat).
A lack of understanding of C++, which would apply whether or not you were using the Arduino (eg. using = for an equality test)
A problem that cannot be reproduced. (eg. a = 2 + 2 giving 5, when everyone else gets 4).

What maybe could be added is a "basic wiring error" for ground not connected or data lines swapped.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I liked: "Not reproducible, or trivial."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I found a comment about "trivial" in the Meta post I linked: "I'd really hate having "trivial" as one of the close reasons. There are so many things that seem trivial to some people..."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I read a “mental typo” counts as a typo too. It was for a question answered with a comment "why would your program print the output you want if you don't issue any printing commands"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"*How about three close reasons?*" SE sites generally only get 3 off-topic close reasons (some sites may request an additional slot to 4, currently only Stack Overflow has 5). Splitting this into 3 may prevent adding new off-topic close reasons in the future, or at least make it more difficult to adjust.


















I just closed one that could have been closed as this. However it's no hardship to just do a custom close with your own message. Do we really need a other close reason?

While writing the Meta post, Meta suggested the old question about the same close reason. And there are 8 upvotes and no downvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5a prepared close reason can be tracked in stats


















I was quite busy for a few months and did not have any chance to check Arduino Stack Exchange and when I open today I have lost near about 120 points I don't know why and there is a message Serial Voting corrected. Is there any chance I can get back my lost reputation? Or do I need to earn them again?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I lost 100 reputation pointsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hey - yeah, Majenko's answer here is correct. It's seriously unfortunate, but was a necessary voting correction that affected a good number of users. If you or anyone else has questions about it, I'm happy to help answer them. Just poke me in the comments here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, thank you @Slate. It is now clear to me if I have any further doubts I will surely let you know. Thank youb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm late to this question on meta, but I just realized, that I lost a whole 3600 in reputation. I was wondering but this answers it. Must have been a really bad rogue user to give me 3600 points.


















I would vote for introducing this new closing reason.
While the first sentence in the descriptions (with the "not reproducible" and "typo") leaves a bit open what exactly is meant, the second sentence ("less likely to help future readers") is the important part in most cases. I don't want to advocate against the first sentence though. We need to have a single sentence description part, which can be used as title. Such a short sentence will always leave something open.
Also: From my experience (might be different when looked at from the real numbers) the close votes are mostly done by the more experienced users on this site, which will not be confused by the option. And question writers will get a more fitting close reason. Currently we often only use "off topic" and then write a comment that C/C++ syntax is off topic. These comments might still be necessary to give more details, but more information for the user is better. And it comes with rather little cost.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5thank you chrisl. the description avoids the word 'trivial' so it gives two of the most common causes for a trivial question. this is how they fine tuned it on SO and having the exact same wording as SO makes it consistent on network


















I am sorry. I deleted the comments before the question was closed. I thought you convinced jsotola that the question is on topic and I didn't expect other members would think the question is off topic.
It is normal to delete obsolete https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commentcomments, because purpose of comments on SE posts is to clarify things and then the comments should be removed.
The question is on topic of course. Fritzing is a tool used in Arduino world.
To answer the question, I asked one more clarification in a comment 2 days ago, but you were distracted by the off topic discussion.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, after my question was re-opened ~ 2 weeks ago, it was closed again today (with reason: 'off-topic'). I remember that you left a comment there some time ago telling close-voters to consider the question as on-topic. But this comment was removed, in the meantime. Perhaps you are somebody else considered that comment as obsolete. But given the fact that the question was closed again, perhaps it wasn't obsolete after all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@maxschlepzig, I can't write an answer on Arduino SE about bug in a Fritzing component. We found the problem and it is not an Arduino based problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, usually the question itself determines whether it's on-topic or not. Not its possible answer. Answering it with: no, it's not a feature/misuse of fritzing but a bug in the component would be a valid answer btw. Funny how my question was first closed than re-opened and now closed again while it didn't change. Perhaps  the [Feel free to ask about anything related to Arduino.](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) sentence doesn't really reflect reality.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@maxschlepzig, Using Fritzing is on topic. Fixing Fritzing is not. Even fixing some Arduino IDE bug is not on topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Couldn't disagree more. Imagine a stackoverflow question inquiring about some GCC behavior. Someone knows that the behavior is due to a GCC bug - and instead of just answering along the lines of 'the behavior you observe is caused by this bug, cf. link/bug number/etc.' that someone votes to close that question. Because it's a bug, you see. Since stackoverflow isn't about fixing bugs etc. This would be quite out of space.


















This topic has been discussed previously but not seemingly clearly resolved. (ref. https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/200/are-questions-that-are-only-related-to-arduino-by-the-parts-used-on-topicAre questions that are only related to Arduino by the parts used on topic?).
Recently (early 2022) some community members have been implementing a strict policy that seems to me to have low utility, and to be somewhat harsh (ref. https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/88969/looking-for-vibration-sensorLooking for vibration sensor, https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/88978/continuous-servo-motorContinuous servo motor).
I would argue that questions about using Arduino MCU's often relate to the parts selected and interfaced. That's why the community has tags to identify these topics. Some of the tag info wiki's specifically encourage such questions. (e.g., https://arduino.stackexchange.com/tags/sensors/infoSensors tag, "Use this tag for questions about selecting, connecting, using, and debugging sensors.") If the spirit of the question is about using the arduino ecosystem, then I think the community should start the conversation in as friendly and as tolerant a way as possible in the spirit of exploring what might be a useful question.
Currently the https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicon-topic help says (regarding General Electronics being off-topic) that, "If knowledge of Arduino would improve a question, it's on topic.". If an OP is asking about connecting a widget to an Arduino board then while they might not know if the issues are specific to Arduino, I believe they are hoping that we as a community might. Similarly, if a widget might possibly be connected to something other than an Arduino that shouldn't automatically make it off-topic.
Is the community able to:

agree a more objective policy
if so update the help page
follow a more tolerant implementation strategy?

My suggestions regarding implementation are:

Leave a couple of days before closing doubtful questions of this type
If the question generates useful on-topic comments or answers, then it should be deemed on-topic
If there is a history of similar questions and answers being on-topic, then the question should be deemed on-topic (but may possibly be a duplicate)
That the community should focus on the OP intent more than the letter of the "on-topic" law

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about widgets used with an Arduino on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've seen literally most of the question posted here downvoted or closed, which doesn't help anyone. It's probably the "problem of small authority" in an over-zealous mod, but perhaps the acceptability criteria need loosened. Or whomever is just being a jerk needs to chill a bit...


















What is on topic on Arduino SE is in Help Center in https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I ask about here?. Some type of questions, even on-topic, is not suitable for Q&A format. There is Help Center article https://arduino.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askWhat types of questions should I avoid asking?.
Some questions are in the gray zone for on-topic and/or Q&A format. Then it is on community members with close vote privilege to decide about the question with close votes.
On-topicness should not be discussed in comments under the question. The right place is the Meta. If you see such a comment, flag it as "no longer needed".
On-topicness of the question about the vibration sensor linked in question, depends on the solution. I for example don't know if there is a couple of established ways to measure vibration with Arduino or the answer is generic and opinion based.
I don't see a reason to change the Help pages about scope of Arduino SE.
Your suggestions are valid but it is on the community members to implement them. As a moderator I only close questions which are clearly off topic or miss important details and could attract low quality answers (Then I follow the question to reopen after it is completed).

I've been browsing the Arduino forums for years. I have no idea why I find it so fun, but after all this time, I see the same frikin problem over and over with posts!
People never include schematics/drawings! 90% of the questions the OP asks why his code isn't working, and the first 4 comments are "Please post schematics". Most new people don't understand how it's usually quite helpful to have the entire scope of the project laid out for those trying to help.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a pinned post at the top of the forum that outlines how to ask a question? It might save these new users as well as the helpers a little frustration. Or, when creating your first post as so many folks are, there's a template that you are presented with to overview before creating your first post.
Just my thoughts.

Congratulations, Arduino community! We’re going to be creating a custom site design for you that we hope will represent your subject and we want you all to really love it. You’ve been waiting almost 5 years and we really want to do this well. To facilitate this, we’re reaching out now to ask you for what you’d really love to see in the design and logo.
I’m Paul, one of the Product Designers here at Stack. I'll be working with our community managers in order to ensure that your custom theme reflects your community. I’m not an Arduino expert (though I did join the Makey Makey bandwagon and had a Tessel) - so I’ll be relying on you to help guide this process. Looking forward to it!
A quick history lesson about site theming
Originally, site designs were part of the site graduation process. When a site left beta, they'd get their design. But, at the time we only had one designer who was working on designs and the designs were very specialized and often involved a lot of custom illustrations. We got into a situation where several sites were in queue for graduation but the designer didn't have the bandwidth to actually create the designs.
Before she worked here, Catija asked the question https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257317/can-beta-sites-slated-for-graduation-get-full-site-abilities-without-site-designCan Beta sites slated for graduation get full-site abilities without site design upgrade? - on MSE. This kicked off several discussions within the CM team of the time and community members and the eventual decision was to implement "https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-septemberDesign-independent graduation" in September 2015. This meant that many sites were finally able to leave beta without waiting on a design - including Arduino!
At that time we also had much more strict guidelines for when a site could graduate - they had to consistently get 10 new questions per day. This level of volume made graduation impossible or very unlikely for many sites - meaning many would stay in beta forever. As such, the CM team considered another request - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303727/lets-break-up-with-graduation-and-remove-a-bunch-of-beta-labelsLet's break up with "Graduation" and remove a bunch of "Beta" labels - and that's what eventually happened, too. In 2019, we https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/331708/congratulations-to-our-29-oldest-beta-sites-theyre-now-no-longer-betaremoved the beta label from 29 sites and https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/374096/congratulations-to-the-59-sites-that-just-left-betaanother 59 in December 2021.
We've also gone through several design systems changes, including https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/26/episode-436-meet-the-design-system-that-lets-us-customize-and-theme-stack-overflow/launching Stacks version 1.0, which make creating and building in designs much simpler for both our design team and the developers. In fact, we showed off how flexible it could be in our April Fools prank this year "https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/05/12/an-unfiltered-look-back-at-2022-april-fools/Filters for Stack Overflow".
What to expect
Over the next few weeks, we'll be communicating with you about your site design, so please help us out as much as you can. While we may not be experts on the Arduino, we know that you are and that you likely have great ideas about what you want this site to look like - so share them with us! You've got a week now to pool up your thoughts in answers to this question, at which point I'll start working on this site.
I'll spend some time working on a design based on your guidance, and we'll be back when it's ready to show you what the design and logo look like. At that point, y'all will have a week to make suggestions for adjustments to the design. Our hope is that there will be little that needs adjusting but, due to the size of our backlog, we can't allow more than one phase of feedback, so any changes will need to be recommended at this point.
We'll then consider the changes proposed and make any adjustments that we feel are beneficial. Changes that are too big or are out of scope likely won't be possible, but we'll make sure to explain why we opted against making a change should that happen. Please understand that design is often a subjective thing and we may end up with community members differing in their opinions, so we'll be taking that into account when deciding. Decisions about the final design will be made by the design team and CMs with the concerns of the community taken into account.
Also, it's worth keeping in mind that the goal of these designs is to make something topical, unique, and attractive, but we'll be designing within the scope of our newer site theming. We'll be able to create a logo, background colors, and textures in addition to your logo - but please don't expect illustrations like what you may have seen on some of the older site designs.
Process
Over the next month or so, we’ll be going through a few steps to get your site design up and running. This post is the first of those steps. I’ll also be using this post to track the phases in the table below.

What we need from you
As I've mentioned already, we need some inspiration from you so that we can get started on this design and create something you'll really be proud of. So far, I was able to find a couple older discussions about logos and site designs here on Meta. Feel free to reference them if there are ideas you like already - or give us new ones! We're really looking for design ideas rather than needing you to design anything for us.
When you're answering this question, think about:

What symbols or images are important to the subject of this site?

Especially things that speak to insiders that we might not find on our own


Are there any colors that are tied to your subject?
What tone/mood/feeling would you like your theme to emit? While this is subjective, it helps to set some design guardrails. So, when answering with your thoughts, some good information to mention is where the theme might sit inside these axes:

From fun to serious
From classic to modern
From simple to complex


How could a good logo represent your subject? The Arduino logo is trademarked so we can't use it. There is the https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark/community-logoArduino Community logo and colors. Or should we come up with something else?
What are things to avoid?

If you have any questions, let me know! We're really looking forward to hearing from you and getting your site design underway.

I think we should use the Arduino Community Logo and the colors from the logo.
It is exactly the use for what the Community Logo was intended and it makes a strong association between Arduino SE and the worldwide Arduino community.

But if not, what is it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe they mean printed circuit boards. However forums and similar used to be known as Electronic Bulletin Boards so perhaps there is room for confusion there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@NickGammon, the link is in the Q so I didn't repeat itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I think they did a good job with this logo. Would be nice to use if you all like itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I interpreted the caveat on the Arduino Community Logo as that it can't be used on products or services that are paid, but that it would be ok here on SE. Is that your understanding too?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@paintedbicycle, maybe the best would be if SE Inc could ask Arduino (BCMI US LLC)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Juraj Cool, we're going to do that. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@paintedbicycle  I think their sentence "The customised logo can be used on ... any public platform you are using to self-organize and communicate" would reasonably be taken as giving us permission, as we are a public platform and we communicate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for all your feedback and thoughts! I got the go-ahead from our community team to start the design using the Arduino Community logo and colors. Seems to be a bit of a consensus hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The final design is now live!

What symbols or images are important to the subject of this site?

As Juraj mentioned, the Arduino "Community" logo would be a good starting point. Then, perhaps, something related to electronics.

Are there any colors that are tied to your subject?

The colours from https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark/community-logohttps://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark/community-logo (as mentioned by Juraj) would be reasonable colour to theme with.

What tone/mood/feeling would you like your theme to emit?


From fun to serious

Arduino is targeted at beginners. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduinohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino — some of their original projects showed off quirky ideas like a cat feeder based on a re-purposed CD-ROM drive, where the drawer would open, covering the food, and close to allow the cat access to it. So I would aim for fun/quirky/educational. :)

From classic to modern

Modern.

From simple to complex

Since we are aiming at beginners I would lean towards simple.

How could a good logo represent your subject? The Arduino logo is trademarked so we can't use it. There is the Arduino Community logo and colors. Or should we come up with something else?

I would lean towards the Community Logo, or maybe a stylized and simplified version of it.

What are things to avoid?

Cats. Nah, just kidding! Cats are adorable fluffy things — until they bite you! (Like mine does).
More seriously, take a look at https://electronics.stackexchange.com/Electronics Stack Exchange. They use some electronics logos (for example, a diode symbol with a circle around it). You would want to avoid making this site look too similar to theirs.

Other ideas

The classic thing people start off with is the Blink sketch which blinks an LED or two. So maybe LEDs or their representation could feature somewhere.

Arduinos tend to use "shields" which are basically printed circuit boards vertically plugged into the one below. Perhaps that could be used somewhere.



Thanks, paintedbicycle, for your post. We are looking forwards to the ideas you come up with!

Update - revisions posted at the bottom

I'm Paul, a designer here at Stack Overflow and the designer working on the upcoming Arduino site theme for you. I reviewed your responses to my https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2716/custom-arduino-community-design-and-logo-information-gatheringfirst post - and below you'll find the site design I came up with based on your ideas and input.
Your site design
From the answers and comments on the original post, I understood that you wanted a simple and modern design that also has a bit of fun. There was also agreement that using the https://www.arduino.cc/en/trademark/community-logoArduino Community logo and colors was a good starting point.
Color scheme

Logo
https://i.stack.imgur.com/lu64q.png
The Arduino community logo offers a space to customize which I used to insert the ? icon hinting at questions and answers here on Stack Exchange. The typeface is https://github.com/rsms/interInter, which is a feature-rich, clear typeface that is also open-source and available on GitHub. I hope you agree those qualities seem to fit the open-source nature of the Arduino project.
Page Design
I used these elements and I set them against a custom background that I hope does two things:

It hints at a breadboard (white background with small holes) used with Arduinos
It also hints at other technical SE sites, including https://math.stackexchange.com/Math and https://electronics.stackexchange.com/Electrical Engineering, https://askubuntu.com/Ubuntu, and maybe even https://crypto.stackexchange.com/Cryptography.

I hope it has a sort of "maker" or "DIY" or "behind-the-scenes" vibe to you.
For a bit of fun, I found this lovely little LED illustration https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Led_lampeggiante_con_arduino.svgcreated by Giacomo Alessandroni and released under CC licence to the community.

Following the SE custom of making the meta theme similar, but "greyscale", you can see what Arduino Meta would look like below.

We hope you enjoy this design, but if something doesn’t feel right, now is your chance to share your feedback. This window for feedback will be open for one week. We will then work to incorporate feedback as best as we can, finalize things on our end, and lastly, deliver the design to your site.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Site design and logo — Draftb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The final design is now live! See this post for more details: [New site design launched](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2729/80022)


















I like the main site design. The breadboard idea is neat. I tried to make it look more breadboard-like by making a gap every 5 rows (like a real breadboard, there are gaps), however that made it look fussy so I think I prefer your original.
As for Meta, having the logo grey makes it look a bit "dirty" to me. Could we have the logo still coloured but the words "Arduino Meta" in grey? I mean, the grey seems to blend into the background too much, making it looks a bit of a mess.
Or maybe, like Electronics SE, make the logo lighter grey to make it stand out? I'm not sure. Maybe use the coloured logo but desaturate it, but not totally.

Having said the above, I like the design, yes. And even unchanged it is great! Thanks, Paul.

And yes I can absolutely take a look at tweaking the Meta logo and report backb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I updated the logo and background to hopefully take care of your concerns. Posted the tweaks at the bottom of the original postb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@paintedbicycle Looks great!


















I like the idea of using breadboard pattern as background, but to be recognized as breadboard it needs square holes with the right proportion of space between holes.
https://i.stack.imgur.com/i6JGS.png

Couldn't the SE logo be used instead of the ? bubble? Or a Q&A text instead of the ? in a bubble more similar to the SE logo shape?

I see on other sites that the header with logo and site name can have a different background to not to interfere with the logo and picture at the right.

The picture you took the LED from is created in Fritzing, a popular application to create wiring and breadboard designs. The components in Fritzing have CC license, but I think we should not use the Fritzing LED.
I like https://academia.stackexchange.com/the header on Academia. If we can have a picture in the right upper part, there could be more than a LED. For inspiration, the Arduino IDE splash screen and the Arduino site have illustrations with electronic component symbols as characters and ornaments.

Maybe the Ask Question button could be orange.

I think the teal colored question titles don't go well with the green color of accepted question label.

I think there is a bit of a consensus about "simple" and "modern" so I'm not sure I'll land where you're hoping. Having said that I will definitely take your point about square holes for the background. And I'm going to change the logo a little bit too, to not use the "?". I tried the SE logo but the colors look a little weird together so I may use words instead. Thanks againb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@paintedbicycle, I like the updated logo. Did you try orange for the Ask button?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did! Sorry I forgot to mention that. The color contrast was really bad (~3:1) with the orange and worse with the yellow so I ended up staying with the teal hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@paintedbicycle, thank you for trying


















I'm not personally a fan of noisy backgrounds. I'd much rather a plain, more simple, background.
The LED I find a bit silly and very much out of place.
The main logo though I have no real problems with.
Like Nick I think the meta logo looks muddy and dull. It could be brightened up a little.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you - I'll dial down the background just a touch which should help your first point and your last point. I think the LED was about a bit of "fun" and "quirky". I'll try moving it to the footer. Thanks for your thoughts!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have now posted the updated screenshots in the original postb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@paintedbicycle That looks much  better to my eye. It gets my vote :)


















As you can see, the new site design just went live! At this point, we are done with major revisions to the design (although you can still report CSS/styling bugs by starting a new post and tagging it with /questions/tagged/site-designsite-design and /questions/tagged/bugbug). Thank you for your valuable design feedback.
I have enjoyed working with you to create this theme. Thank you for being engaged in the process, and I hope you enjoy the new design!

Stack Overflow has a setting in the preferences for Light/Dark mode for quite some time now.
I would like to also have a dark mode in Arduino SE.
I don't know how such things are handled in the Stack Exchange environment. Is it planned to provide this feature on Arduino SE? If not, why? Is there some kind of hindrance for this to come to Arduino SE?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is dark mode coming for Arduino SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/359739/plans-for-dark-mode-for-all-stack-exchange-sitesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mhh, that sounds like "not in the next 5 to 10 years". Sad thing. Should I delete this question, since already answered on meta SE?


















I'm doing an Arduino based project but I'm struggling to achieve a long range with RF communication, searching ended up to many questions related to long range communication with a problem analogous to mine but different requirements so I have asked https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/90976/how-to-achieve-a-direct-15km-transmission-with-at-least-300kbps-bit-ratethis question
My question has been instantly downvoted and a bandwagon effect followed and someone blamed the question as offtopic and closed with the motivation that "same kind of modules could be used also with something different than Arduino, so Arduino is not relevant".
Maybe it is my opinion that problems like the one of question I have asked, may be useful also to other Arduino users that have to deal with remote controlling and long range communication but sure if applies the rule "if the modules you are dealing with Arduino could be used regardless Arduino the question should be closed" an humongous number of questions as a
