Are questions that belong to the category "What Apps Should I Get?" appropriate Android Enthusiasts? How about if they're asking for specific apps, such as "What are good RSS aggregator apps that integrate with Google Reader and allow offline reading?"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are "What Apps Should I Get?" Questions Appropriate?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Whatever the decision, we'd better settle on it soon because we're going to be [swamped](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/321/what-is-the-best-music-app) [very](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/133/what-are-the-best-personal-finance-applications-for-android) [quickly](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/277/whats-the-best-security-anti-virus-app) [with](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/81/any-good-world-time-applications) [these](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/275/good-dictation-transcription-software). What a mess.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't seem to have gotten any better.


















Most I have seen are list of X questions, and likely should be closed. Many answers are non-authoriatative and subjective, including my own on a GPS/traffic question.

It seems to be an abuse to simply make this a request board for app suggestions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure its an abuse. While I don't want to be overrun with app suggestions, I also think these questions are the main ones people are trying to get answered. I don't think we want to alienate those users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mark @matt You are right about not wanting to shut down and alienate users, bicycling.se is facing a similar problem. However, take a note-taking app for example, how can someone expect any kind of a reasonable list that some 8 months down the line will really be of virtue? I think the line of app-listing questioning needs mitigated in a static-post, dynamic answer fashion; but we also can't have comm wikis pointing to dozens of app categories either. Having dozens of responses seems unorganized and messy and the cream won't necessarily rise to the top.

Note:
We are closing this domain naming thread. It is asking the entirely wrong question. See this blog post for details: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/domain-names-the-wrong-question/Domain Names: Wrong Question
We're going to keep the name android.stackexchange.com. But we WILL be setting up redirects from the more "popular" domains names. (e.g. seasonedadvice.com to cooking.stackexchange.com, basicallymoney.com to money.stackexchange.com, and others as we go through the list).
New question: "Write and Elevator Pitch / Tagline!"
https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141/write-and-elevator-pitch-taglineClick here to contribute ideas and vote.
[original message text below]

Post your ideas for a dot-com domain name for this website, which captures the spirit and intent of the site, namely:

{name} is intended for enthusiasts,
power users, and regular people using
the Android operating system.

Please follow these guidelines:

Check to see if the domain is taken before making the name suggestion. Taken names, however clever, are not helpful. You can use whois.net to check availability. (Read this http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/domain-names/post regarding squatted names).
Post one domain per answer. This makes the voting process much easier. If domains are very similar (e.g. "dev" and "devs"), they can be in the same answer.
Make sure the domain wasn't already suggested. To search within this question, use a search query such as: inquestion:1 "example.com" replacing example.com with the domain to search for.
When coming back to this question, make sure to sort the answers "newest first", as to not miss new proposals.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our domain be?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5ForceClose.com :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ivo That's probably one of the things I dislike about the SE model competing with old SE 1.0 sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My first answer was about registered trademarks; I've tried to suggest actual domain-names, but the answer keeps vanishing. Actively deleted, or swallowed by the system?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Turns out droidoverflow is taken...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5should we avoid the use of registered trademarks? Like, er, Android or Droid?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@OtherMichael According to the android branding page http://www.android.com/branding.html you can use the word 'Android' and 'Droid' to describe a site, but not as the entire name. Or ' for android' when naming applications.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Joel says: If the name is registered but is being “squatted,” i.e., there’s something there, it’s just not anything worthwhile, ask the owner if they would sell. If it’s available for a reasonable amount of money, and it’s a great name, and the community loves it, we may even be able to buy it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks like we don't need to worry about this: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/domain-names-the-wrong-question/ (At least until they change their minds again.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al-E: Well, it's not that we don't need to worry about it; it's just that we need to broaden the question:  Forget about domain name... what should our site be called?  --No idea what this means for domain names of SE sites when they come to maturity, though.


















Unless/until http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/7418/android-developersthe Android Developers suggestion at Area 51 takes off, I think SO should be used for development questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's been closed, so that answers that.  Too bad in my opinion.


















If the question in subjective, I generally agree with Ivo Flipse's answer, though I think there are usually good ways to re-phrase the question that are not subjective:  Instead of "Which dinosaur app...", you could ask "What are the differences between these three dinosaur apps?" or "Are there any dinosaur apps?"

(Sorry, Dinosaurs were the first random topic that came to mind.  I must be a five year old.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't agree with "are there any dinosaur apps?" unless you expect the answer to be a literal *yes* or *no*.  The wording very strongly implies an app recommendation, just like "which app should I get."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, but sometimes you aren't able to find ANY apps that perform a task you want, and this can help you find one, if it exists.


















Generic or specific questions should be made community. Like "What's the best traffic app?". Questions like "What apps should I get?" should be closed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is no appreciable difference between those two wordings.  They would both receive identical answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Aaronaught All I'm saying is that "What are the best apps?" "I have a new Android what should I put on it?" "What's your favorite app?" "What app couldn't you live without?" questions should be closed. Anything more specific should stay.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I see what you mean, you're saying that the question is OK if it's asking for a specific category of app.  I still disagree that those should be allowed; there's an endless variety of them and they're tantamount to polls.


















HumanCyborgRelations.[com/org]

(and this is my counterpart, r2d2)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ha, if that's really available, I'm tempted to snatch it up myself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe it is. I still think it's a cool name (even if someone downvoted me)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's cool, but I don't think it's a good fit for this site.


















I don't think it's appropriate to eliminate questions simply because they have a subjective element, especially if there is the question can invite objective answers.  For example, I don't think a completely subjective question like "What's the funnest game app?" has any value.  Questions like that shouldn't be asked, however, a similar app suggestion question like "What is the most effective anti-virus app?" is completely appropriate.  This question invites quantitative responses that will add value to the community.  If you use a particular app and you simply like it, then don't answer.  If you have used several apps and have knowledge about something that makes one app definitively stand out from the rest, then by all means, share. I don't see the harm in this.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Both of your examples do not have objective answers.  If you want a "list of antivirus apps" then that's objective - but the fact that people will simply vote for their favourites makes it a poll, and polls in large quantities are harmful to a Q&A site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not asking for people to tell me their favorite antivirus apps. If you use and anti-virus app and you like it very much, don't answer.  If you have evaluated several and have some quantifiable evidence that one is more effective than another, that is relevant information and not subjective.  Yes there may be more than one answer, and ultimately which one is the best may be subjective depending on the field of options, however, in many cases there are a small subset of "right" answers that can be backed up by data.


















I have seen that some questions are tagged with [android], but since this site is only about Android I don't see this tag usefull. Basically all questions should be tagged with that tag.

Can we black-list the [android] tag?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we black-list the Android-tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about "android-market" - should we just use "market", since the inclusion of "android" is a tautology on this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also: **Starting to deal with duplicate tags** http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/37/starting-to-deal-with-duplicate-tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're going to see a lot more "android" tags (and dupe questions that have post-dates PRIOR to the start of beta!), now that the gadgets.SE questions have been slurped in.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, it should be black-listed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will delete the android tag from posts as I see itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks like this has reverted. We've been seeing the android tag on questions again, and not just migrated ones.


















AndroidExchange.org

Edit: .com and .net was taken.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 It may be a little vanilla, but it's par for the course, memorable, and it flows off the tongue.


















This is still a list of X question, just rephrased. Consider it as a cooking.se question: 'I like macaroni and cheese, what are some other macaroni and cheese recipes?' It invites poor answers that have a subjective basis (especially here where it would often be localized to a particular handset).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with your example, but wouldn't the following be acceptable on cooking.se: "I love mac & cheese, but my recipe is missing something.  What would make this better?"  ...I think what our bigger question here is: is this site a place to discover new apps, or do we need to direct those questions elsewhere?


















We've got a while, but no harm in starting to brainstorm now.  Besides, I'm part web designer and I like thinking about these things, even if I don't have a lot of time to contribute in that regard right now.

Also, does anybody know: is there open licensing on the Android logo, or are there copyright issues involved?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Design & Logo ideas?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I love the current logo, maybe we should just stick to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@CustomiZer - this was posted back in the beta days, before there was a logo.  I like the current logo, too :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I must have missed the date, my bad. But then why does old topics pop up on my sidebar list ? Isn't that something that must be looked into ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Depends. I think the sidebar links are based on cross-links ("Linked") and similar topics ("Related"). Date probably isn't a factor.


















I think there is value to a generic, community wiki question when it provides answers a lot of people are going to look for.  Phrasing the question, "What should I get?" is a bad idea, but maybe making a CW question that is generically useful for all users is not bad: "What is your favorite Twitter app and why?"

Check out the following CW questions on Stack Overflow.  All of them have multiple "right" answers, but are highly rated and favorited by the community.  In fact, these are some of the highest rated of all questions:


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/108631/what-is-your-single-favorite-development-toolWhat is your single favorite development tool?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/95072/what-are-your-favorite-vim-tricksWhat are your favorite Vim tricks?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These are almost universally considered to be grandfather questions, questions from the early days while Stack Overflow was still experimenting with its identity.  They are highly rated because they are highly-viewed and *easy*; most of these popularity contests would never stay open today.  The one exception is the books question; questions linking to external *information resources* are usually OK because they give users another place to look if they have a question that's not appropriate for the site. Additionally, "app rec" polls are already causing difficulties on other SE sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting, I never realized that.  Found this discussion on the SO meta, which reiterates and adds to what you said: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/57226/should-we-have-a-list-of-x-close-reason/57248#57248


















I would certainly hope that model-specific questions are appropriate, otherwise we've rendered the entire site impotent as a support resource.

However, your specific example question seems both speculative and not specific to Android, which probably isn't going to be considered on topic here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd have to agree. Questions about the Evo (or any other model) - fine.Questions about Sprint (or any other provider, anywhere) - not so much


















I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this:

Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are "good/bad/best" - yikes!

Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable.

I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah!

Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff.

Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on.



P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/332/is-there-an-alarm-clock-app-that-takes-account-of-personal-and-or-public-holidaysIs there an alarm clock app that takes account of personal and/or public holidays?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/322/how-can-i-choose-between-shazam-and-midomiHow can I choose between Shazam and Midomi?


In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these.

I just don't want to see two hundred "Post your favourite [X] app" polls by the time we hit public beta.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These questions flirt with the fuzzy boundary we still haven't really defined.  Is this a site to discover apps?  If not, is it a site where I can get help finding an app for a specific function?  I agree this needs to be nipped in the bud, but isn't this kind of the point of the private beta, to make sure we define that line as clearly as possible, and then enforce it?  (Or do we define it BY enforcing it?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@keith: If our site is about discovering apps then we add virtually no value to the vast ecosystem of sites that already do this way better than we do.  Searching for specific apps is OK because that requires the Q&A format that other sites *don't* do so well.  Yes, defining the boundaries is what the private beta is for, and that's what we're trying to do here. ;) Obviously we need to (attempt to) enforce them, otherwise they won't be taken seriously.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I voted to close a few of those. A few of them I'm still a little uncertain about.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Clarification: By "uncertain" I mean I feel weird being the first to vote to close.  I'm pretty sure they should be closed, but I want to be the first to say so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@keith: I don't feel weird being the first, and I've already cast my vote on just about all of them, so feel free to add yours.  The only question is whether to choose S&A or NARQ; I lean toward the latter for obvious polls.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And it continues: [google calendar app](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/374/google-calendar-app).  This won't stop until/unless we stop it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think a few of the questions you listed aren't bad at all, including "What Lost Phone finder do you use and why?", "What Android Apps do you pay for?", "What Apps do you have that you have uninstalled for performance problems?" ... IMO none of these are subjective.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt: These *are* bad questions to me.  They have no correct answers.  They have no *wrong* answers.  They add almost no value to the site because you can find this kind of information anywhere.  They're not in fact questions at all, they're just polls.  The votes are invariably useless because everybody will just vote for their favourite(s) which tells a reader nothing except popularity.  These kinds of questions don't belong on a Q&A site; all they do is bump good questions off the front page and distort the mechanics of the voting/reputation system.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of all the ones listed, the performance problems one is the only one that I would even consider "OK", but it's still basically useless because everybody answering has a completely different device and configuration, and many people will experience performance problems that other people won't.  And you have no idea *what* the performance issues were or how the submitter determined that it was those apps; for all you know it could be blatant superstition.  Honestly, **why are people so obsessed with making lists of things?**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with your contention that all questions that ask for the [insert superlative here] app are subjective and bad.  I'll use a question that I asked and you took exception with for example: What is the lightest homescreen replacement / launcher app?  There is a quantifiable and objective answer to that.  If you read the question and the description I am clearly not asking for your "fav" launcher app. I specifically want to know what launchers use the fewest amount of system resources.  This isn't a poll about what people think, it's a request for real data.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another one: "Whats the best app for identifying apps or settings that cause performance problems?"  This may be more subjective, but it still should only elicit specific suggestions of a limited # of apps that meet measurable criteria.  Just because someone wants to answer with a thoughtless personal "fav" instead of a reasoned and evidenced answer doesn't mean the question is bad. The voting can take care of bad/inappropriate answers and bad/inappropriate questions. I agree that ?s that can be answered by a simple market search have no place here but the net you are casting is too broad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@matt: You haven't quantified anything at all.  What is "light?" Smallest size? Smallest memory footprint? Lowest CPU time? Fastest speed? These are all completely different criteria and there isn't going to be one app that does them all (especially considering that you can customize how many of these apps run - do you mean out of the box or with all bells and whistles disabled?). "Light" is no better than "best", and voting **won't** take care of bad/inappropriate answers because **people vote for their favourite apps as opposed to the quality of the answers themselves** - that's the problem!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Aaronaught: I think that "light" is pretty clearly understood as the lowest demand on system resources.  This IS a quantifiable measure.  Yes, you can break it down into more granular factors and debate the individual and aggregate affect of each and all however I think doing so is not necessary and the hypothetically subjective scenario where some one does break it down, does not characterize the merit of the question or outweigh the potential value in recommending a launcher app based on it's meta-efficiency.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Aaronaught: "people vote for the favourite apps as opposed to the quality of the answers themselves."  I don't.  No one should.  I know it happens but the fact that people don't always use the system appropriately isn't a very good reason not to ask questions that will ad value to the community.


















Just another angle at defining the fuzzy boundaries of things here.  Say I'm looking for a Books app with barcode scanning and GoodReads integration, is asking whether one exists and what it is on topic or too subjective?

  What Apps Should I Get?


Should be closed as not a real question (too vague). Here are some similar questions that I imagine being asked:


  
  What is your desert island top 5 apps?
  Which app do you use the most?
  Which app has changed your life and now you couldn't live without?
  Which relatively unknown app do you think more people should know about? 
  


I think this sort of question could be very popular and attract lots of answers and might even be an interesting read. I'd rather not see this type of question regularly, but it's almost inevitable that we'll get some popular questions of this type.


  "What are good RSS aggregator apps that integrate with Google Reader and allow offline reading?"


Yes, I think that's OK. It's answerable and it helps someone solve a specific need. In the definition phase of this site someone suggested this question:


  Is there an app/Which app is best that can do [task]?


This question received 6 ontopic votes and 0 offtopic votes. So this sort of question seems like it should be allowed. Also people are asking this type of question a lot, so it's obviously something people want to be able to ask.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would qualify your [task] with some task that isn't inherent to the type of program you are running; in other words the question needs to not only ask for X Apps that do X, but further go above the standard needs of X Apps and does some specific Y-functionality. For instance, Twitter clients all tweet, and (although this may be disputable) not all of them also post to facebook. Likewise, the RSS example you have above, all RSS readers can integrate (through import at the least) with gReader, but not all of them do offline reading. The problem remains, how to judge that special thing Y.


















How are other beta sites dealing with duplicate tags?

For example, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applicationsapplications (most popular) vs. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appsapps vs. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-appandroid-app. These bring up three different sets of questions that are all about apps.

(BTW android-app is redundant and should be removed regardless since the site only covers android apps to begin with...)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Starting to Deal with Duplicate Tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also: **Can we black-list the Android-tag?** http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/17/can-we-black-list-the-android-tag


















I totally thought the same thing about the 'android-app' tag being redundant.

We should choose which one is the "authoritative" tag and edit all the questions to use that one.  I vote we use "applications".

(Is there a way to blacklist tags?)

[beta] : Actively participated in the private beta.

If I recall correctly from the Web Applications stackexchange beta, these are awarded just a bit after the site goes public beta, once you have actively participated.

This site has been running nye on 3 days. It's far, far to early for the beta badge to be awarded.

I say no to warez/cracks.

Marketplace/Market Place aggregator links are A-OK. e.g. AppBrain, Marketplace proper.

Alternate Marketplaces are OK, as long as they aren't warez sites disguised as such

Google Code links are A-OK

Links to applications that are free, where otherwise they'd be paid for, not ok.

Links to applications retracted from the marketplace, not ok.

I think the same rules apply as those rules for program hosting. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd add that links to apps on alternative Markets, eg SlideMe.org should also be ok.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Links to applications retracted from the marketplace, not ok." makes sense, but also frustrating, somewhat. this is why we need FLOSS !!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn I've updated my listing based on your comments. I've not heard of Slideme.org, but it looks like a good alternate for different apps.


















I think this is a good question, but remembering that in a year from now, that app may not exist anymore.

I would love to be able to get an answer for these kinds of questions, because I don't think there is any other resource for this.

Now that the Android questions from gadgets.StackExchange have been merged in, we've got a lot of duplicated questions that pre-date the start of beta.

Answers can be different, or come from the same people.

If one of us asked a question or gave an answer in gadgets.SE, that shows up on our profile here, but we don't get any credit for it [how would you give credit to a non-beta member, anyway?]

BUT, if we close questions from AE in favor of pre-existing gadgets questions -- what would happen to rep?

RoboticBrainInfo.com

I feel that since androids are a compliment to our brains, in external form, we should graft a site name that compliments it's use.

I say use the name of the build: Donut, Eclair, Froyo...  Merge them all into this.

The number isn't bad but it may be confused with other app version names, or other relevant numbers.

Using "Android-2.2" is pure redundant silliness.  Why should we have to specify that we are talking about "Android" on the "Android Enthusiasts" StackExchange?  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe Froyo-2.2, etc.? Some people may know the Android version # but not the code name for it (despite the fact that they are named alphabetically).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't necessarily think "Android-2.2" is redundant, because it specifies that we're talking specifically about the Android operating system, not just an app or function of android phones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good points but I still think that having "Android" in the tag isn't necessary.  The site is about "Android" so it's in a class of it's own.  There is nothing else in this site that would be on the level of "Android" in the taxonomy.  Apps however should be tagged with  the name of the app in the version tag because there are numerous possibilities on the same level.   

I still vote for Froyo but if no one likes the dessert names then my second choice is 2.2.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about `2.2-Froyo`?  The tag field searches based on what you type, and this will be found by typing either "2.2" or "froyo", and help prevent redundant tags again in the future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the hyphenated version-codename (or codename-version) myself -- It covers the two unique identifiers of each version and excludes any other redundant information.


















I have been reading a lot of "answers" that are merely someone's opinion or lazy guess.  If someone asks a specific question and you don't know the answer with authority then don't answer.  If you find yourself writing "I think..." or "Your best bet probably is..." or "I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..." then please promptly hold the backspace button down for a few seconds then click on the "x" in the upper right hand corner of your screen.

I don't necessarily think that someone has to have actually done something or used some solution before they can suggest it, but there is a line between giving a well reasoned suggestion and regurgitating what you read in the app market. I'm not sure where that line is, but I think it needs to be there.

I see this as more damaging to the site then the "Subjective" questions.

Am I way off based on this?  Should we be more diligent about providing substantive answers?  Should I just stop complaining and downvote an answer if it's an empty guess?

Disclaimer:  I realize that I have probably answered several questions like this.  Ooops.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we refrain from answering with lazy guesses or opinions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Gotta love teasers like the comments on this answer: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/41/can-i-update-my-t-mobile-g1-htc-dream-so-it-runs-android-2/74#74 "You can do that, but I'm not telling you how!"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@richq I know!  Hopefully we'll get some better answers now that the public beta has begun.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@richq - I didn't post how because I did not have a stock ROM for 2.1 on hand, I just knew that it existed since I had seen it before, and that is what I commented. I did not say I knew where it was. If you do know what it is and you're looking for a guide on how to use it, I'd refer you to other questions on the site which cover that subject.


















Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around.

However, There should be a standard for these "Here is an App that will help" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place.

Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we?



For QR images, I've been using the following method:

1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share


2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.


3) Copy the URL of the QR code


The URL is
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=150x150&chl=market://search%3Fq%3Dpname:com.appspot.swisscodemonkeys.appsBlockquote

Which is basically

http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=150x150&chl=LINKHERE

If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com


That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth.

4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is

(I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself)

I propose that until we're out of beta we eliminate or reduce the requirements to edit tag wikis. Right now nobody even has 1000 rep. Perhaps to get some action there, we can make the requirement something like having asked or answered a question with the tag and have been up-voted once in order to edit tag wikis.

I would expect that those sorts of answers would be less helpful and, as such, not get voted as highly. I think the natural mechanisms of the system will take care of it.

Pulling this out of comments so it can receive proper votes, if it's the way to go:  [version-codename]

2.1-Eclair

2.2-Froyo

This avoids the overly-verbose "android" in the tag, and it makes the tag findable with the auto-complete if you start typing either the version number or the codename.

I just converted all apps and android-app tags to the applications tag.

I also created synonyms, https://android.stackexchange.com/tags/applications/synonymsplease vote :)

Jeff Atwood nuked the Android tag.  I re-tagged questions that were left as untagged.  

I'm not sure if this means users still be able to add new questions with the tag or not.

Thanks, and this is why two letter first names should be outlawed ;)


















My two cents:

The dessert names of the versions is fun and all, but most of your normal users aren't going to have a clue as to what it means. Further, it doesn't appear on the phone, while the version number does.

So, at best, our dessert names should only be synonyms.

I wonder if the naked [2.2] isn't a bit too esoteric. But, then [android 2.2] and [version 2.2] are redundant if clearer. (The former also has the added benefit that if there were a merger in the future, or Android forked into multiple product paths, no global renames would be required. That's probably not something we should be worrying about, though.)

So, I say [<version number>], with [<dessert codename>] and [android-<version number>] as synonyms.

Update: The community isn't playing along.

android-2.2 x 50

2.2-froyo x 24

froyo x 6

2.2 x 1

1.5-cupcake x 3

android-1.5 x 2

android-2.1 x 34

2.1-eclair x 8

2.5-gingerbread x 1 (which is just plain wrong; everything I've seen indicates Gingerbread will be 3.0, except for http://www.droid-life.com/2010/10/22/gingerbread-will-actually-be-android-2-3/this, which implies that Gingerbread might be 2.3)

I still stand by my suggestion of raw version numbers (e.g., 2.2) as best, with tags in the style of android-2.2 as second best. Not everyone knows about the dessert names, and if Google stops naming their versions that way it's not going to make any sense. Tags based on the official names is more future-proof.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Al, we can actually do a mass tag merge as moderators and then create synonyms from all of the removed tags to the [version]-[codename] tag.  Since the codenames are pretty popular in usage, I still feel that the [version]-[codename] is best approach to go since it drops the redundant [android] tag and contains both the version number and name making it pretty clear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree that it makes things clear. However, I'm on board to do it your way. I think, however, that in the future we're going to need to revisit this. At the very least we're going to want good, clear, tag wikis.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Bryan: Here's another wrinkle: How to handle 2.0. It shares the same codename with 2.1; they were both part of "Eclair". So, now we're going to have `2.0-eclair` and `2.1-eclair`?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Wasn't 2.0 completely replaced by 2.1?  As in it is now obsolete according to: http://developer.android.com/intl/de/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.htmlb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, but we had at least one question on here about a device with Android 2.0 on it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Further, what about Android 2.0.1, which followed 2.0 rather quickly, and Android 2.2.1, which is currently live on several flavors of phone?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al I think those minor version would still fall under their major version (2.2).  Not sure how to handle the 2.0 since that OS version is obsolete (0.1% of all Android devices)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's fine. I just think that this naming convention is going to come back and bite us. What we have works for now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looks like Google have just confirmed that Honeycomb will be 3.0 http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2011/01/sneak-peak-of-android-30-honeycomb.html


















My first thought with all of these is to err on the side of being a little verbose.  I like the format [manufacturer]-[model-name]: htc-droid-incredible, motorola-droid, motorola-milestone, etc.  That way phones with really short names don't get an ambiguous/confusing tag like x.

It does become a little unclear whether "droid" is officially part of the name for some models, though (for instance, is it the Incredible, or the Droid Incredible?)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree.  [manufacturer]-[model-name] sounds good to me and we can create synonyms from [model-name] to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, "Droid" won't be sufficient as a tag as it's a whole family of phones by multiple manufacturers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would say the [Droid] tag should be a synonym for [Motorola-Droid].  All other Droid phones have some other additional name with it.  HTC Droid Eris, Motorola Droid 2 and X, HTC Droid Incredible, etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with [manufacturer]-[model-name]. @Bryan: is there a way to make the [Droid] tag the [Motorola-Droid] to point to the same place, or are you just saying we should treat them the same?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@matt: Once you have 1000 rep, you can suggest synonyms to a tag, and vote on suggested synonyms.  I don't know what exactly happens with those, though... are new questions using the synonyms automatically re-tagged?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you set up [Droid] as a synonym of [Motorola-Droid] then behind the scenes it will swap [Droid] to the [Motorola-Droid] tag, therefore condensing synonym tags into their parent tag.

You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus.

Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers.

Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.

Any thought about actually including a QR code generator in the Android SE text editor itself?

What should be the standard spelling for tags where the American and British spellings differ?

For instance: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/synchronisationhttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/synchronisation

I expect "synchronization" to appear any time.

Obviously synonyms can take care of the fragmentation, but one has to "win". It seems to me that mixing the two will be too dissonant.

(I also see that "sync" is out there too. That will need to be synonymized.)

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/syncsync × 14

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/synchronizationsynchronization × 2

One question actually has both tags.

I think "sync" is used more because, well, it's a simple abbreviation and the full word is hard to spell. Also, a lot of devices have used "Sync" as their official term for what they're doing with your data. (I know that all those years I used a Palm device I don't know that I ever saw the word "synchronization" in any documentation.)

The grammarian in me prefers spelling the word out, but I'll go with the community's preference.

Electronic Gadget got http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/shut down for several reasons, partly due to lousy stats



How're WE doin'?

As of Sept 30, 2010:

* 585   questions
* 1,187 answers
* 79%   answered
* 557   users
* 997   views/day




As of October 9:



My observations:


Our number of questions is excellent
Our question:answer ratio needs some improvement
Our user-count needs improvement, but Gadgets represented two months (plus?) of public beta; we're at only three weeks, and users keep getting added. So no worries.
Our views/day is dropping? Does anybody have actual stats tracking, instead of these two, random snapshots?


Caveats:


Android-related questions/answers imported from failed Gadgets beta
Are these QUALITY questions?
Are these QUALITY answers?
At least we ain't http://programmers.stackexchange.comProgrammers.SE !!! (they've got great stats. Quantity over quality, I guess)


What can we do better?

What do we need to do to help avoid the fate of Electronic Gadgets, and wake up one morning to find all of our content was ported over to Programmers in the middle of the night?

droid.io for "Android Input/Output" 

"I/O, refers to the communication between an information processing system, and the outside world possibly a human."

This fits in two ways:


In a way our community is an android related information processing system based on Inputs (Questions) and Outputs (Answers).  
Android is itself a system of I/O


I know the .io is a little unconventional but I think the name flows nicely and it's short.

We might also find great benefit in sharing this with Motorola, Samsung, HTC, etc. on-line communities and forums. I think it would be a great opportunity if we started sharing answers, links, etc. at these places! The idea would be to attract users without harming what they have going on already.

Is it possible to buy sponsorship/ads on Android podcasts or websites?  Does StackExchange give the communities any sort of money to do such a thing?

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1579/using-paid-ads-to-create-community/1582#1582This meta.SE questions seems relevant.

While I think adwords would be a waste of money a display ad on a good Android blog might be affective but I think we should focus on courting blogs to just write about android.SE, or link to us in articles.  We may even be able to get smaller blogs to just post a banner link for free, as a resource to their readers. 2. We should wait on a Facebook page until we settle on a domain/name as you can't change it once it's set in FB.

I did a search on the words "htc sense" and only one article came up.  I started entering a question with the words HTC and sense in the title and several article were suggested with both words in the title. Is there a problem with search?

Are "wifi-tethering" and "wifi-hotspot" redundant?

Why am I forced to use the "feature-request" tag when I am not requesting a feature? This notification showed up for me today when editing an existing question, and when creating this new question.

Is there any way to avoid it, other than entering this usually-incorrect tag? Meta is for meta-discussion, not just feature-requests, correct?

We closed the https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5/what-should-our-domain-bedomain naming thread (click for details).
Instead, let's start with a killer "elevator pitch!" Joel will be blogging about the elevator pitch approach to naming, but to get you started:
The Elevator Pitch
This isn't as easy as it sounds. Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. Make every... word... count.
Here are some creative examples:

http://gawker.com/Gawker: Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe.
http://gizmodo.com/Gizmodo: The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural.
http://www.autoblog.com/Autoblog: We obsessively cover the auto industry.
http://www.dumblittleman.com/DumbLittleMan: So what do we do here? Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane.
http://www.needcoffee.com/Needcoffee.com: We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm…whipped cream.

Use it as a Tagline
A shorter elevator pitch can be used as a tagline — something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples:

http://slashdot.org/Slashdot: News for nerds. Stuff that matters.
http://www.lifehacker.com/Lifehacker: Don’t live to geek, geek to live!
http://www.thesimpledollar.com/The Simple Dollar: Financial talk for the rest of us.

The Motto (don't forget your logo)
A logo begs for it own little, short tagline — like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it:

Just do it.
Think Different.
The Uncola.
Intel inside.
Like a rock.
The king of beers.

…and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site… eventually. So let's start from the basics. Come up with a killer elevator pitch, tagline, and/or motto!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Write an Elevator Pitch / Taglineb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You mean *an* elevator pitch, no?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, I think he mean "write" and "throw the elevator as far as you can". The ElevatorPitch is a sport derived from the CaberToss [please note that in non-Scottish locales the eat() method MUST be overridden to avoid a Haggis dependency; trust me -- the overflow errors on that one are terrible], and it RealBig in StackExchange InnerCircles. At LAN parties it is usually followed by a tag-line, a variation on a conga-line, but with dancer-applied semantics.


















Treat it like any other answer. Leave a comment about the error to urge the author to correct it and to alert others.

There's a common fallacy about the "accepted answer;" that its means it was selected as the "right" answer or the "best" answer. Accepted answer means only that it was the post that best helped the author of the question. Nothing more. It's unfortunate that the answer happened to be incorrect (easily remedied as I described above) but there's nothing to be done about changing the author's personal choice.

I would think it's perfectly appropriate. Android is defined by the range of available options there is; and not as drones of unified, all-encompassing, all-similar of device. There is a range of Androids with touchscreen and slide-out keyboards; or touchpad and directional pad; and often what's the best answer for one device configuration is totally inappropriate for another.

An equivalent question would be: "are language-specific programming questions appropriate in StackOverflow?"

The site is for Android phones as well as the Android OS and applications which run thereon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Addendum: Recommendations ("Which phone should I buy?") are off-topic.


















Example: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/selecting-the-right-android-phonehttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/selecting-the-right-android-phone

Is this really the kind of question we want to encourage here? I mean, is "I need a phone with these features" helpful to anyone but the OP? There are new phones coming out all of the time, so even if it's helpful it will be quite a bit outdated within months, if not weeks.

Isn't this site about using the device you have, rather than finding a device to buy?

Update: Note this blog post about putting the kibosh on shopping questions on Super User: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/

Since Android is arguably "Super User for Android", should we be more draconian about squashing these? I think sometimes it's hard to recognize a shopping recommendation for apps here because so many apps are free.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Shopping recommendationsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that it is a bit localized and the information will be out of date in a few months time.  Should it be a CW or just completely discouraged?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Here's another: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2460/rugged-android-tablets-pleaseb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally I think they should be completely discouraged.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And, considering one can no longer opt to set to Community Wiki, this makes it more imperative to squelch these kinds of questions. I'd like to hear from more of the community, however.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't tend to arrange my life according to how SuperUser operates. For instance, this whole site exists bin large part because their moderators feel there is a clear distinction between CPUs that sit on the desktop (like a Commodore 64) and CPUs that are portable (like an iPad or Android) beyond portability.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Michael: True enough, but since this site is most like SuperUser among the original trilogy, and they blogged about it, it seems to me that it is something to consider and that, perhaps, it will become an edict from "on high".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think are plenty of reasons to frown at shopping recommendations beyond SuperUser, that's all. Freshness date, for one thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, absolutely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unfortunately, as far as apps go, the requests for recommendations just keep coming.


















It's pretty safe to say that shopping recommendations are off topic on virtually any Stack Exchange site (unless someone builds an explicit "shopping recommendation" site, of course). 

It's even listed as off-topic in your original charter… twice:

Hey guys,

I know when we recommend apps we usually link them to AppBrain. The issue here is the minor inconsistency with the links. I like to link the app and also insert the QR code.

AppBrain have a nice simple app widget as seen below which has all the app information plus a link to the QR code.



Is there a possibility to implement BBCode to allow users to copy and paste the BBCode app widget?

Hi folks, 

Two month after, I'm seeking for enhance this small module ; do you think we should add something ?

Currently, 228 users are using it.

What about you ? Do you need something more ? 

Thanks for your help

I'm trying to add this to (regular, non-hosted) gmail. I haven't added a lot of widgets, and I'm stumped

the gadget URL is http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3505759/gmodules/android.xmlhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3505759/gmodules/android.xml

It shows up, but is empty



and the gadgets settings tells me I need to configure an ID (of course)... but I can't find a way to configure the ID.



Does this not work for gmail -- which otherwise accepts gadgets --, or can I configure it?

Isn't the rule of thumb that tags should be plural? Wikipedia uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorizationthat method:

Set categories are named after a class (usually in the plural). 


Eg, if we're talking about "New York City" the tag is not "city" but "cities" -- because the tag would be applied to "Paris", "Chicago" etc.

Just so for "apps" "alarms" "keyboards" etc.

I may have followed this rule inconsistently, myself. Mea Culpa.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it depends. For instance, [contact] as a tag makes no sense (IMNSHO), but [contacts] does.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5well, that's my point -- [alarm] as a tag makes no sense: as singular, it would be applied to THAT QUESTION AND ALARM INSTANCE ONLY; as plural, it would be for many instances of alarms and alarm-related issues. [handsets] refers to all, [HTC_Desire] refers to one specific type (but all instances of that specific type). Thus [alarms] and [proximity_alarm] are distinct.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with using plurals.  I find it useful to prepend "On the subject of" to the tag when deciding.  "On the subject of alarms" makes sense, "On the subject of alarm" does not.  Some exceptions are device names because of an implied "the" ("On the subject of [the] droid") or when the primary sense of the word/phrase is not a noun.


















While that's pretty cool, AppBrain is not the only market out there, and it is a for-profit venture. I think it's fine for users to link to wherever they want, I don't think the site itself should be seen as giving any site preferential treatment. If we add markup for AppBrain to the editor, we'd have to add markup for all other sites, as well.

Not unless there's some form of kickback for the moderators, that is! I'd like a Nexus One and a 32GB SD card, please.

At any rate, I don't think that we can customize an individual SE site at that level.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see why SE can't give preferntial treatment to a site that is favored by the majority of it's users.  It's not as though he's suggesting that we block all other market aggregators, he's just suggesting that we add markdown to make it easier for SE users to link to the aggregator that is already the most frequently linked to. Also, BB Code isn't specific to Appbrain. If any of the other app aggregating sites like androlib or androidtapp decided to offer bb code widgets then they could join in the fun.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, because they're the biggest for-profit site, we should help them -- for free -- continue to be the biggest for-profit site? Plus, it would look, quite rightly, like Institutional favoritism. Kinda throws the throws any pretense of objectivism out the window. If they pay for such treatment, and that was acknowledged, it would be a different story.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you're fighting the wrong fight here mate. If AE implements BBCode then people like me could use sites like AppBrain to add app widgets to my answers. It's not about using AppBrain but they do have a nice app widget that is compact and present all the information a user would need. Like Matt said, BBCode isn't specific to AppBrain so therefore you don't have to use it with AppBrain only... but people like me would get the benefit of BBCode since I use AppBrain to link the apps I recommend in my answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mlevit -- Sorry, the whole "utilise AppBrain's app widget" in the question sure looks like something via AppBrain. It's not clear to me how this can be used for other sites. If it can be, it needs to be explained clearly, with examples.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5BBCode isn't unique to AppBrain therefore it can be used with any other service that provides BBCode to format whatever information you'd like to display.


















The Gingerbread SDK is rumored to get released on November 11. Shortly thereafter I expect there will be a flood of questions "when will {phone X} get Android 2.3?" We're still getting questions like that for Froyo.

My idea is to have one Community Wiki question: "When will my phone get Android 2.3 (Gingerbread)?" that will contain as many models and dates as we can find. Many of us read a lot of Android blogs; whenever a new date is announced (even if it's a rumor) we can edit the question to have that information, with links to sources. (Alternatively, we could have answers for each phone model, but I think that would get unwieldy.) That way, we can then close every other question about an individual phone and point it to the CW question.

And, of course, being Community Wiki will allow more people to be able to edit it.

Thoughts?

Update: It would probably be worthwhile to have a Froyo question too. There are still devices out there waiting for that upgrade.

Yes, excellent idea. It's great way to curb the redundant questions and it's a good sticky post that will likely get some link backs from other sites.

Also, I agree, the answers should be updated in the question.  It will get very unwieldy having a separate answer for each phone. 

Maybe something like this:

Title: 
When will my phone get Android 2.3 (Gingerbread)?

Body: 
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) was released on November 11th, 2010.  This community wiki will list all of the known and rumored dates for devices. If you have an update make sure to follow the format that's been established, and the following guidelines: 


Keep phones in alphabetical order listing the Manufacturer and model
Specify if the date is confirmed or rumored and link to the source
If there is an unofficial release, link to the site where it can be downloaded.


If you don't have enough rep to edit the wiki, leave your suggestion in a comment or answer and someone will update the list.

Is this where we list an "unofficial" ie rumoured date, or is it where we list when unofficial 2.2 OS (eg Cyanogen) was first released for that hardware?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn, It's the latter.  "Unofficial" would be for the phones that will get no official update to for that Android release but someone has hacked together an update and it's available for download.


















With all the tablets coming out and all the manufacturers trying to "improve" Android with their own custom UIs, I think it would be useful to document what UIs are running on devices, how intrusive they are and links to any other options.  I haven't seen this anywhere and this could be a useful resource to the community, and pre-empt a lot of questions.  

I recently bought a Viewsonic G-table which claims to be running Android 2.2 but when I got it I discovered that their TapNTapUI was so intrusive and clunky that you'd never know it was running Android at all, or that it had a Tegra2 processor.  If I didn't know better I would have thought it was an old Oregon Scientific PIM with a really big and pretty screen.  I'm returning it and have ordered an Archos 70, however it took a long time to research exactly what "improvements" (perversions) Archos has made to the UI and how deeply ingrained they are (supposedly, they are only minor changes that you wouldn't notice).

This may be a little ambitious in scope and beyond the focus of this platform but I can definitely see a bunch of granular questions like... 


"Is the Archos 70 running a proprietary UI?"  
"How do I remove the TapNTapUI on the G-Tablet?" 
"What tablets are loaded with Vanilla Android?"


... and the benefit to rolling them all into a wiki would be creating link bait and keyword rich posts that would help bring people in.  

Thoughts?

Sounds like a good idea. My ancient (migrated across from the Gadgets.SE site) question https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/644/android-phones-without-custom-uisAndroid phones without custom UIs could be used to get some starter info in there.

Probably worth doing as two separate Wikis? One listing devices and UIs and then a second one with the Pros/Cons/Features of all the different UIs.

Would we want separate Tablets and Phones Wikis? Will it even be easy to draw the dividing line between phones and tablets in the future as new devices arrive that blur the lines between them?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Al might be right, this may be a little overly ambitious and outside the scope of this site.  It's something I'd like to see somewhere though.


















I have two concerns.

One, "intrusive" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else.

Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge.

This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them.

Android.StackExchange is a site managed primarily by the community. Reputation is a general measure of engagement with the site, and as a user's reputation goes up he or she gets more privileges to help manage the site. Reputation is gained, primarily, by receiving votes on questions and answers.

However, if the community doesn't engage, by voting, then users don't gain reputation, thus don't get additional privileges. This means that the users are not able to self-police the community without moderator action.

Why is it important to vote on both questions and answers, and what are these votes supposed to mean?

Hey guys,

I just thought of a pretty good idea in my opinion after reading a question like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2840/comparision-of-video-players-for-androidthis for the 10th time.

What if we start small Wiki posts for certain popular categories like:


Music Players
Video Players
Home Screen Launchers
SMS apps
more...


We could list apps that are the most popular on the market these days and have small sentences describing the app and what makes it unique/popular. This would be a good reference for people interested in same Music Players to go and find the popular ones out there and what their differences are.

What do you guys think?

NB. We could make certain conditions for app to be listed like... they must have over say 5,000 downloads and a minimum rating of 3 stars just to cut out the junk apps.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Idea: Create Wikis for popular app categoriesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not against lists, as long as they are high-quality and properly maintained


















What would be better, IMHO, would be something added to the Insert Hyperlink box that would generate a QR Code in addition to, or instead of, the regular URL.  QR Codes can be generated to represent any text, so it would be a natural fit (again, IMHO).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would be nice... but the only issue with that is we would have to generate the actual Android Market URL in order for the QR code to work.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, you simply convert whatever is put in the URL line to a QR code.  For example: http://qrcode.kaywa.com/img.php?s=8&d=Now%20is%20the%20time%20for%20all%20good%20men%20to%20come%20to%20the%20aid%20of%20their%20country.


















I am trying to be a productive member of this website and I'm having a problem with the reputation system.

Now I don't have a problem with the reputation system as a whole, I find that it works well.  I am familiar with it as I am also a member at StackOverflow.

My problem is this:  Twice now I've wanted to comment on an answer or vote it up because it didn't seem to be getting the votes or recognition that it needed.  But, since I didn't have enough reputation I have no real choice but to leave another answer with a nod to the previous answer.  Both times I was voted down, leaving me that much further from being able to vote up or leave comments.

Here are the two questions and answers:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2603/an-app-to-locate-my-android-around-the-house/2633#2633How can I locate my Android device around the house?

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2935/best-screen-protector-htc-desire-z/2942#2942https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2935/best-screen-protector-htc-desire-z/2942#2942

In the second one I was very explicit in my answer about why I was posting an answer, but I was still down-voted.

So, what am I supposed to do?  How am I supposed to help the community find the right answers when I can't steer them towards them?  I post as much as I feel is necessary and no more.  I'm not going to go around posting in every question I find just to get lucky and get an up-vote.  That's not helpful to the community.

In Al Everett's https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/180/what-does-voting-mean-and-why-is-it-importantpost about voting, he lists reasons to vote down an answer.  It does not say anything about a duplicate answers.

So, what to do besides posting the odd answer and hope that it is up-voted?

It is really discouraging me from trying to participate.

My thoughts:  Perhaps any answer should give the poster one or two reputation points in order to encourage participation.  Otherwise, I don't quite see the point.

I'm pretty open to what I consider useful subjective questions, but this doesn't query the communities Android expertise or any information about using or getting the most out of and Android device, it is just question for newsers and android blog enthusiasts.  I think this is off topic.

Pretty much any question linking to those sites would benefit from a direct Market link.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know.  It all depends on how many people are browsing the site from their Android devices.  I'd say a large majority of the posts make reference to an app in one way or another.  A direct market link would be helpful in all those cases for people browsing on their phones, but are useless to those accessing the site on a non-android device.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt,@GAThrawn: Would it be possible to have a Market URL format, such that when you browse in Android, the URL will turn into a Market link but when browsing on non-Android device, it will turn into a regular link to AppBrain/AndroLib/Cyrket/etc and/or perhaps QR barcode?


















One way to help us reach the http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/18238/android-enthusiastssuggested goals is to https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/180/what-does-voting-mean-and-why-is-it-importantkeep on voting.

We've each got 30 votes per day -- let's use them!

Okay, I've never cracked my vote-cap on Android, and only done it once on SO itself -- it's sooooo much easier when there are a ton of questions. Which also suggests... aks more questions....
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've hit my cap once but I'll get on it more.


















Clearly questions like...


  "How do I register the
  someThingTechincal() intent within the
  framework by daisy chaining the
  java.tree before I compile the MySQL
  class..."


...are off topic and better suited for SO, but there is going to be some overlap between Development questions and questions about dev tools that are relevant to power users.  

For example: Questions about the Android Emulator, or the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/3002/where-in-the-file-system-are-applications-installed/Android File System.  

How do we want to handle these?  

Personally, I am not a developer and do not plan to develop any apps but I am looking into installing the emulator and I am interested in hacking the hell out of my phone in the interest of making it do exactly what I want.  Do we want to keep these hacking/power user questions here even if they tread into development area or do we want to ship em off to SO?

If we do choose to keep a big tent and keep them here how do we articulate the difference in the FAQs so that it's clear where the line is?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions that are on the fence between development and power useb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Recently [this question](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/38024) was closed, more probably because of asker's terminology than other causes. The words "I was building an Emulator" should be interpreted in the "create an AVD" way, not in the "build from source code" sense. I think it was closed unfairly because other power users that use the emulator for preliminary testing devices (not developing apps) could face the same error shown in the question. I think the FAQ should create a specific section that trace the line between what can and can not be asked about the Android Emulator.


















Personally I'm inclined to keep a big tent attitude and keep a lot of those questions here for 2 major reasons:


I want to keep developers around because they are some of the best suited to answer questions on android.SE (as long as they are clear that this isn't the place for programming questions).
Even if a borderline question could be answered over at SO, as a laymen, I think that the SO community can assume that you have a certain baseline knowledge and provide technically complicated answers, whereas I think those questions are likely to be answered in a more appropriate style here.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These questions would draw some attention from XDA-like folks, which would be a big win for this site, both in terms of knowledge and for spreading the word around the Android community. Furthermore, I'd assume that Android devs that use SO, also keep an eye out for this site, so we're catering to the same community


















I'd like to see more discussion on the scope of topics for Android.SE.  We have established that the site is for "enthusiasts, power users, and regular people too using the Android operating system" and not for "programming questions," but I think we could use a little more discussion about where those particular boundaries actually are.  We should also continue to discuss the topic of "Subjective" questions, CWs and "Lists."  

I know for some people this is all black and white but just watching the habits of the active users it is clear that there is a lot different opinions out there.  Even among the mods there seems to be a variety of views on this.  I think that some more discussion will help us tease out the sweet spot of "scope" that helps us balance the needs/wants of the community with the necessary restraints needed to keep this an organized and focused Q&A site.

Questions/discussions of this nature should be tagged with the tag https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scopeScope.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5More Discussion on the Scope of Android.SEb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know if I have any clear answers, but I think this is needed discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5is the faq tag appropriate for this one? I think the tag is reserved for questions that are asked often in meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Louis: There have been at least 11 questions concerning the "scope" of the site so far.  Wouldn't you consider that a frequently asked type question?


















Ok, here's another take that is contrary to my two previous answers and more consistent with Michaels point:

This is a community of Android Experts and Enthusiasts.  Searching google for answers to question like the one you posted can be very confusing and fruitless because of all the speculation.  This community of users is uniquely qualified to filter through a lot of that speculation and provide a more coherent answer to a noob.  In many cases a lot of us have already done that by religiously reading the Android news sites, blogs and forums to satisfy our own interests.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is not that we're not qualified or capable to answer such questions, it's just that compared to solving real problems, these questions are actually really crappy and tend to be asked more frequently and for every model known to man. So if users want this info: they should come to chat or you can have certain announcement posts on Meta as @Al has made before


















This https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/3244/how-can-i-manually-add-memory-to-the-android-emulatoremulator question seems to be a unique use case.  He isn't really asking a programming question, but a hardware question (emulated via software) for a user's purpose (new to Android and wanting to try it out before he buys into it).  I don't think this is much different then telling a physical-phone user that they need a bigger SD card.

I would even say this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4053752/android-emulator-tips-and-tricks"Tips and Tricks"  question(for the most part) would even belong better here than SO.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2793956/android-emulator-wont-run-application-started-from-eclipseThis however would be a good example of a developer specific question of an emulator question.  More likely than not, emulator questions will be developer questions.

I would also consider questions about attaching DDMS (developer logging utility) to a phone (or installing/using aLog) somewhat relevant, because a user may need to do this to get error logs of an app to provide us more info (or to a developer).  There may be other similar "tools" that would fall under this.

Sometimes high-end power users might actually have to get their hands dirty and actually tweak some things that you might even consider programming related.  Rooting/custom roms falls under this area.  If I think the question is too advanced (beyond what I know), I often point people to http://forum.xda-developers.com/xda-developers because they much more experts on rooting and roms than I could ever be.  I'm fully open for these questions being asked here, it's just I don't know if we have the people here that can answer all of these types of questions.  I might consider myself an expert with rooting and using a custom rom on my Motorola Droid or G1, but if someone asked me about [X] or [Y] phone, then I myself would go to xda-forums to see if I can find an answer for them and try to break it down for them here.  

(As a side note: providing answers here that xda-forums would provide is much easier to parse/read than a 60 page thread on xda-forums on some new hack a developer came out with for [X] phone because of all the noise and "discussion."  I was reading about the NookColor being rooted today and that thread had some interesting gems in it hidden by a LOT of noise).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's exactly why I *hate* forums.  For pure unstructured discussion they are fine but for any topic of utility I'd much rather have something like the SE platform that allows the community to filter out the garbage.  It drives me nuts when I go to XDA and I have to sift through 110 pages of posts that add no actual value back to the topic at hand.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That Emulator question that you answered is perfect example of one that could have been asked at SO but I think was more effectively answered here.  I think there's a clear distinction between the first one and the other two in that the first one is about using Emulator as an Android enthusiast and the other two are about using Emulator to develop apps.


















I happen to like list questions, but it does seem to fall outside of the scope of how the SO sites are defined, and I do understand that.

We do NOT want the site devolving into weird list-questions -- that pulls it away from the core focus: using the lazy-web to find the best answer.

What would be a nice is an adjunct discussion board, like the chatrooms. Banish discussions and whatnot off the main pages -- but not off the site entirely. Harness those energies....
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd suggest making a blog (I know the Wordpress folks are trying to set up one for all SE-sites), where you simply posts these lists. How to create them is perhaps a different discussion. In my view, I always thought Meta was a good place for these kind of topics as the rep is gone and it's off the normal site too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the list-blog idea!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My only conflict with this idea is that the Stackexchange format with the voting of answers is so perfect for lists.  It allows for such an elegant way for the cream to rise to the top.  I can see how rampant lists can distract from the core mission of the site but I'd rather see a separate silo for lists that follows the same format instead one that follows traditional wordpress or tumblr blog style).  So maybe there could be android.stackexchange.com, meta.android.stackexchange.com and LISTS.android.stackexchange.com.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know we can't create a new sub-domain for every splintered take on the core but users propensity to posts lists is very prevelant in several of the SE sites: android, iphone, webapps, wordpress, superuser...  Every time I see them posted I see a TON of user interest and involvement but also considerable resistance from mods and powerusers.  I think it's a logical extension, particularly for the sites like Android that focus largely on definable things (apps) as opposed to concepts and code.


















How about the question part is purely a "question" (i.e. what is the release dates for all phones?) and the answer is all phones combined in one post. this way we can accept an answer, and the question will be removed from unanswered list.

And more importantly it makes more sense because the website is supposed to be a Question and Answer website :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems not unreasonable. I'll work on it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. This is the cleanest way to go about it. It fits the Q&A also.


















Ever since Nov 8, we've been skyrocketing upwards.  We're seeing really good growth.  I mentioned the same observation about this stackexchange in the mod chatroom.  We've doubled and nearly tripled our page views.

75% of our traffic is via search engines.  After that, most of it is coming from other stackexchange sites.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e575% search traffic is pretty good for a 3-month old site. The top non-stack-exchange referrer is Twitter, followed closely by Reddit.


















I noticed something interesting today.  This is the most trafficked post on Android.SE and it's less than a month old:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2770/android-2-2-update-for-samsung-galaxy-3-i5801-and-i5800-closedAndroid 2.2 update for samsung Galaxy 3 (I5801 and I5800) (closed)

Just off hand I'd say that it's because Samsung Galaxy Update Android 2.2 are popular search terms.  It's a little ironic that the post with the most views is closed but I think it serves as a reminder that when we can we can be more mindful of keywords and SEO when asking/editing questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Building Traffic & SEOb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Off course it's hard to predict what will be popular in the future. So personally I think the most important thing is to ask as many question you have on Android here and not elsewhere ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's hard but not impossible.  As Google Insight tells us in the last 2 weeks the term "Android 2.3" has risen in popularity 300%.  In the interest of getting way ahead of the curve I am predicting that "Android 10.0" is going to be wildly popular... in a couple years ;o)


















A search in the Market for "Stackoverflow" brings up a couple of widgets and question browsing apps, including at least one (Droidstack) where you can add Android-Enthusiasts and browse and search questions, etc, but it's buried fairly deep in the app.

Given the Android Market provides direct access to the exact audience we are looking for, surely a dedicated app would be a good idea? Marketed in the right way (i.e. as a Q&A app for the phone in your hand, rather than talking about stack exchange generally) it could be quite popular and presumably generate a fair amount of traffic.

This seems a bit obvious, so apologies if it has already been explored and I've missed it. If not, then what could we do to make it happen? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why don't we have a dedicated Android App?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't know if things have changed in the StackExchange API recently, but the big problem used to be that the API only allowed Read access to the sites, you couldn't ask/answer questions or vote. All of which are fairly fundamental things users will want in a stand-alone app.


















For one, we are still in Beta (we don't even have a permanent site design yet!). And for two, it takes some effort to write and maintain such program, and since DroidStack is still very unstable (it crashes all the time in my phone), it would be too early to fork DroidStack's development to support specific sites.

It's a good idea though, I'd think there would be many Android users that don't need/want the full stack exchange network. Maybe sometime after we graduated and we had a permanent site design, someone can start hacking on http://code.google.com/p/droidstack/DroidStack's code with a matching design and settings.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's true, while forking another app is a possibility it's probably not worth someone writing us an app from scratch while we're still in beta, when there is still (a hopefully very slim) chance that we might never launch.


















To answer part of your question:


  … so apologies if it has already been explored and I've missed it. If not, then what could we do to make it happen? 


Here is a great resource to explore and ask questions about application and developing for the Stack Exchange sites: http://stackapps.comStack Apps
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5True @Robert, but he has a point that having an app will make users find us in the Android Market too.


















Following on from https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/114/android-se-is-on-a-good-track-but-we-need-to-work-to-ensure-it-survives-the-betaAndroid.SE is on a good track, but we need to work to ensure it survives the beta, we are now right on Day 90 of our beta. This is the traditional end of beta day on StackExchange, and there's no sign of us launching yet.

I realize that there is no actual absolute pass/fail happening on the 90th day, this entry from the StackExchange blog covers that http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/when-will-my-site-graduate/When will my site graduate, but we have reached a good milestone to look at ourselves and think what we need to do to make sure that we do graduate.

How are we doing?

According to our http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/18238/android-enthusiastspage on Area 51, we're sitting at Good or Excellent on all stats:



What can we do to help?

A lot of this is going to be hard to improve on without attracting a lot more, quality, members to the site. This is where a bit of marketing and self-promotion could go a long way. We need people to ask good questions, and we need people to give good answers (that will be accepted by the questioner).

One easy way to help that anyone can do is to vote. We need more high-rep users to help moderate the site. Vote on good quality, well written, interesting questions, and vote on good-quality, helpful answers. See https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/180/what-does-voting-mean-and-why-is-it-importantWhat does voting mean and why is it important? If you need any further incentive, there are badges available for the first time you use all of your 30 daily votes up, and one for when you've voted 300 times.

What else should we be doing?

There are http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/7 essential questions that every beta site should be asking. have we asked all of them? Have we answered all of them in any satisfactory way?

Some of them have been pretty thoroughly thrashed out in various ways, some of them I don't think we've even touched on:


Are questions about [subject] on or off topic?


Ok, a variety of meta posts go through various aspects of on/off topic, I think we're ok here.

What should our FAQ contain?


Other than discussion of a https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/162/getting-started-guideGetting Started Guide I don't think we've really been into this?

How should we tag questions about {subject}?


Again tagging's been a frequent topic on meta, I think we're covered here.

What’s the “elevator pitch” for our site?


This question needs revisiting just to make sure the answers are up to date and we're all happy with them https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141/write-an-elevator-pitch-taglineWrite an Elevator Pitch / Tagline 

What should our logo and site design look like?


We really need to get some ideas together for this, the previous question asked in September has been pretty much ignored since then https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/25/design-logo-ideasDesign & Logo ideas? and there are no actual logo ideas at all in there. We must have an artist or two in our community?

Who should the moderators be?


This https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/85/moderator-nominationshas been discussed, and we're currently waiting on the SE team to launch a new web-app for voting in moderators, nothing we can do here right now, we have our https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/161/moderator-pro-tem-announcementModerators Pro Tempore, and I've got no problem with the work they're doing.

How do we promote our site?


See that "Help us grow this site" box on the right hand side of the main page? Click it and use it! When you're on another Android site where someone has a problem, and you know the answer is already here, point them to the answer here. Every now and then when you're looking at a "hot" question you get asked if you want to share a link to that question elsewhere, why not do that!

Jeff Atwood is about to drop off from page 1.

There is a http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/25726/googleGoogle proposal in Area 51. It was proposed on December 11th so it's still quite new. It's scope is currently defined as:


  Google web apps, desktop software, and
  Android and Chrome OS


One of the comments on the proposal page suggested that the creator should attempt to appeal to this site in order to expand this sites focus, rather than create a new semi-related site. 

Would it make sense to expand the focus of this site? Does the scope quoted above (or parts of it) seem like it could be incorporated into Android Enthusiasts?

I'm not certain when it was updated but the Android Tag on SO now lists AE for user-related questions. The tag's About page was also updated. This should help bring devs to the site for user-related issues!

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The SO Android Tag Updatedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I managed to get enough rep on the android tag on SO to make the change ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good idea, I've added something similar to the SuperUser Android tag info http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/android


















A large percentage of the questions on http://webapps.stackexchange.comWebApps are for Google products. The proposed site would cannibalize that.

Google doesn't have too many desktop apps (Earth, Picasa, SketchUp) and, considering their Chrome focus they aren't likely to get many more. So SuperUser wouldn't lose too much.

You could also expect an infestation of frustrated website owners trying to make a buck to just pepper the site with questions about their page rank.

On the other hand...

It's sometimes difficult to get the right site. Questions on Gmail, for instance, sometimes are as on-topic on WebApps as they are here. A "Google" site would help with that.

There is an Apple.SE in beta which covers the same sort of scope. A Google.SE would analogous and probably about the same size. Android seems like it's barely large enough to support its own StackExchange site.

Google coughed up money to sponsor several tags on StackOverflow (notably Chrome and Android). They even point developers visiting http://developers.android.comhttp://developers.android.com to StackOverflow. I think it's likely that a Google Q&A site would attract a lot of attention from them. Maybe even some real Googlers.

Ultimately though...

The proposal has been closed.

Would it make sense to transition Android.SE to, say, a site covering Google OSes? Maybe. Moreso if the rumored merger of ChromeOS and Android were every to come to pass.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ahh, was wondering where Google Docs would be... When I consider that iOS:OS X :: Android OS:Chrome OS, Chrome OS may live on a bunch of SE sites (such as here as well as SO and SU).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can see a certain sense with a ChromeOS merger, especially if the two OSs themselves get closer, but where would the line be drawn? What about Google TV? That is actually based on Android, but is clearly different enough that I don't think anyone's even thought of asking a Google TV question here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think Google TV would be on-topic here. Certainly all of the big Android news blogs are covering it.


















I would say that an entire Google SE would have some of the same problems as the Gadgets SE had.

Currently Android is a pretty well defined scope that does seem to have a wide breadth of questions but they have the advantage that despite the breadth, there is a massive overlap and familiarity across it all. I think that every regular question answerer on here has at least a passing familiarity with the topics covered in 95% of questions here; we may not all have installed a custom ROM on our phone, or own an LG device, or be interested in apps about [X], or use a bluetooth headset, or whatever but you know enough to recognize a clear question or helpful answer in any of those. There are common threads across it all.

A site about "Google" is going to have a lot of different silos of knowledge. There are going to be Gmail users, who've never even seen an Android device and Chrome browser users who've never even heard of Chrome OS, Froogle users who wouldn't know a Reader RSS feed if it slapped them in the face, and Google Apps company admins who just want to keep their company's email running. Will this attract enough real experts in all of those areas?

That's quite apart from the fact that the site will have a big overlap with other Stack Exchange sites, like https://webapps.stackexchange.com/Webapps (for all of Google's web properties), https://superuser.com/SuperUser (for all the desktop apps and presumably ChromeOS when it launches), https://serverfault.com/ServerFault (for things like the Google search device), http://stackoverflow.comStackOverflow (for programming against all these platforms) and of course us. Can it attract enough experts to it when they'll also need to look at two (or more) sites relevant to a particular interest. Currently Android makes sense, as it doesn't actually overlap with any of the other sites: Web Apps are quite clearly different from smartphone apps, smartphone questions are unwelcome on SuperUser and programming questions are unwelcome here.

Here was an interesting little experiment:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/3799/word-lens-alternative-port-for-androidIs there a Word Lens alternative/port for Android?

I knew that "Word Lens" was a hot topic yesterday, and that question it turned out to be the most viewed post yesterday.  In fact it's gotten 219 views in the last 20 hrs where as the next most recent post to get 200 views was asked on the 8th, taking a week and a half to get to 282 views.  Of the most popular search terms that brought people here over the last day "word lens android" got 90 and the next most popular was Samsung i5500 2.2 with 6 visits.  

Now as far as questions, this wasn't the best one on the site, and it probably wasn't very useful to building membership because people probably came here found that there is no such app and left.  

The value of the experiment is that it goes to show how being mindful of whats trending and making good titles with good keywords is helpful in getting people here.  Now ideally if we are to seed questions based on hot topics they'd actually be useful (Like Al's "When will my phone get Android 2.x?" questions) so when they get here they find some value and stay.

I had asked a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/3896/read-write-dev-ttysdio0-like-a-file-closedquestion in Android Enthusiasts which got closed as it was more relevant in StackExchange site.  

Is there anyway to transfer that question without creating a new one?

Discussion is discouraged here.


















Flag it for moderator attention; the diamond mods have the ability to migrate from any site to any site.

Want to get the ability to upvote? Ask a question. then wait 20 minutes.
Then you'll be a "full member" ! 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually .. you'll need 15 rep to upvote.


















If you have an account with +200 reputation anywhere in the http://stackexchange.com/sitesStack Exchange network, you will start on all new sites with +100 rep for a total of 101.

Beyond that, we encourage the truly new users to contribute a bit and give the community the opportunity to get to know them and vote on their posts .. before we give them voting permissions.

As for meta, it's tricky. I would like to allow new users to participate here but it's almost impossible to do so without risk, because metas are very low traffic and a malicious new user could cause a lot of damage by posting junk. Thus the 5 rep requirement to keep the bar as low as possible -- at toe level at least.

There is also the argument that participating on meta is a (very minor) privilege that you should earn by at least participating on the main site for a little while, so you have a basic level of familiarity with our sites and how they work. We get a significant number of brand new users who come into meta.so (which allows 1 rep participation) and start explaining how we're all doing it wrong, our entire system is broken, the sky is falling, etc etc. All the old timers just roll their eyes..
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree.. this just felt different than my first experience with SO. I'm trying to decide if android users are just less helpful to each other than programmers, or are the rep points system now discouraging new users (here).  Anyhow I'm happy to have a SE site I might really contribute too more regularly!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How much do we keep for being well behaved over a long time.  Most of my SO REP is gone due to inactivity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jbdavid rep is only "lost" in the cases where the underlying content was deleted due to it being off-topic or what have you. Other than that, which is relatively rare, you should be gaining rep over time as old posts get the occasional upvote.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@jbdavid also you *just* missed the window, having 182 rep on SO. If you had 200+ rep on SO, you would get a free +100 here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I certainly don't think Android Enthusiasts are less helpful to each other than programmers. Remember that the number of users at SO is an order of magnitude larger there than here.


















Let's see -- what happens when a site goes public:


the site gets a custom design and favicon (no more generic sketchy-beta)
it is eligible to have questions migrated to and from it from other sites
the site will be promoted by sister sites in the network, through house ads and question migrations
the reputation levels increase to standard, instead of the relaxed levels that are in place now.


I might have forgotten something, but I believe that's the major points.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also on my list: **"Lock in."** A graduated site has progressed past the *trials* of a probationary period. As a fully-fledged site, it is much less likely to be cited for problems and shut down.


















There are a number of questions that have been migrated over from the old Gadgets.SE as well as other sites that are attached to users that aren't registered here.  Some of them are quite old.  Is there any way to accept answers on these unowned questions so we don't have a bunch of "Unanswered" questions in the system?

Update:  I was thinking specifically about questions that have good answers that will never be accepted because the asker is a ghost.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any way to accept answers on the unowned questions that have been migrated from another SE site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just a question: does this happen if the account is linked to both sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nope, when the asker has an account on both sites and they are linked the new question is associated with the askers account on the new site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Assuming they used the same credentials on both sites. If they use different OpenID providers, then the accounts *aren't* automatically linked.


















Only if the person who originally posted it comes back and asks for the question to be linked to their new account. (I did that.)

But Louis has a good suggestion. I don't know what the thinking is for questions that are not likely to be ever answered and certainly never have an answer accepted. I suppose we could discuss getting rid of them on a case-by-case basis.

Of course, you could always upvote an answer; then it won't appear in the "Unanswered" list.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not possible and in all honesty, I don't think this will ever get 'fixed'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that if a question is an orphan the moderators should be able to accept the answers on behalf of the non-existent user.  I take it from your comment Ivo that this has been discussed already.  I'll do some searching before I post a redundant post on meta.SO, but do you mind giving me the readers digest version of "why" it'll never happen?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that mods should be able to adopt these questions.


















I recently posted this question:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4117/how-to-share-internet-among-2-android-devicesHow to share internet among 2 android devices?

And through the miracle of Android Enthusiasts, came up with the answers needed.  However, the question started as, essentially "connect 2 android devices" but the answers wound up depending on the specific devices (for example, the config file for the tablet may very well be tablet-specific;  I know that other android devices require additional edits to config that the tablet did not).  Should I edit the question to reflect more exactly the answers, something like "How To Connect my Archos Gentouch 78 tablet to my G1's internet connection" or leave it in its more general format?  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5More general title or more specific title?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it answers both.  Usually one just roots and uses a wifi sharing app to enable other devices to connect to the internet via it, but in your case you had to enable adhoc wifi first.  I'm fine with leaving it as it is.


















Your title is fine. The text of the question gets to the heart of the matter and the specific advice may well apply to other devices. Being too specific would likely keep people from visiting the question. I think you struck a good balance.

On the other hand, titles like "I need help!" are absolutely horrendous.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I second this line of thinking.


















I am an Android enthusiast who owns an Archos 43 Internet Tablet, which doesn't include any 3G/4G or phone capability out of the box.

I want to learn more about Android, but some of the questions on this site seem to be very phone-centric, such as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4149/when-will-google-nexus-s-be-available-in-belgium-europeWhen will Google Nexus S be available in Belgium (Europe), https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4068/can-i-get-nexus-s-in-canadaCan I get Nexus S in Canada?, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/867/what-are-the-best-android-phones-available-in-indiaWhat are the best android phones available in India?

I'm just wondering if there is a way to filter this stuff out if it really does belong here.  I'm interested in the OS, not someone's phone buying decisions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is asking about retail availability of a phone REALLY an Android question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your question here has prompted discussions as to what is/is not appropriate for this site: http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/246/faq-what-kind-of-questions-should-i-ask-here http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/247/faq-what-kind-of-questions-should-i-not-ask-hereb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These surely fit perfectly under the "Too Localized" close criteria - "This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time" by definition they're only important for a short period of time, and only ever going to be correct for one network/region/country.


















I agree with you. I have been closing the most egregious examples, but the rest of the community doesn't seem to mind them so much. Otherwise there'd be flags on them and/or close votes.

No, I don't think they belong here. Unfortunately, they're a large percentage of the questions we get.

Someone has proposed a mobile phone site on Area 51, but I don't think it's going to go very far.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Everett: You are correct in closing these. Shopping advice is generally off topic (or should be). If the community doesn't seem to care, that does not bode well for the future of this system. They *have* to be made to care and understand what you do. Close and leave clear comments as to why, not to scold but to teach and inform. They should be voting, closing, and flagging, where needed. Mix up the comments to highlight the problem with the post and what *should* have happened (community self-moderation). If users don't start picking up on these "sign posts", the site will not survive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Robert: Can we add "Shopping Advice questions" under the "What questions should I *NOT* ask" section of the FAQ?  We get quite a few of these and I don't think it's very obvious to new users that this is outside the scope.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt: Sure. That section is not editable directly, but see how Super User's FAQ listed their off-topic subjects: http://superuser.com/faqb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Robert:  I like that much better.

I'd say those are just as off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd like to seea certain subset of Android-specific development questions here. Obviously just because you write program in Android should not automatically render the question on-topic, but I think questions about Android-specific architecture (Intents, Dalvik, etc) or Android-specific development processes (e.g. how to do X on Market, etc) should be acceptable here; those questions are likely to be only very tangentially related on SO or P.SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lie Ryan: I'm not sure where I stand on this but it is an important point.  There are questions that we tell people to ask over at SO and then the SO people tell them to come over here.  I think this merits it's own discussion into the scope of android.se.

All questions on how to USE the Android OS / an Android device.

Some completely made up example titles:


How can I stop certain apps from starting automatically? Should I?
How can I export my contacts to a CSV file?
How can I get my Calendar app to start the week on a Monday?
How can I send a single SMS message to multiple recipients?
How do I root my Android device? Why would I want to?


I guess the key here is if you can't phrase it as "How can/do I do X on my device (in this app)?" it's suspect.

Some good answers here already. I'll contribute by offering generic question titles that don't belong:


When will {device} be available in {geographic area}?
Where can I find a website that tells me {some information about Android devices/apps}?
Is there an app that does {some desired function}?
Is {OS version} available for {my device}?
Which is better: {device X} or {device Y}?
Why does {company} do {whatever the company has done to annoy the asker}?


That's what I have for a start.

Related to https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/246/faq-what-kind-of-questions-should-i-ask-here/252#252my answer on the other question, maybe it's simply "if you can't phrase it as a 'How' question, it probably doesn't belong". "When" and "Why", I'd say, are especially problematic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In regards to *"Is there an app that does {some desired function}?"* I would say this isn't necessarily a "no-no".  I think that asking for an app that performs a specific function or set of functions that can't easily be answered by searching the Market is appropriate. If it's a lazy question that should have been resolved by searching the market, the community should vote it down.  This may need further [discussion](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/31/is-what-is-an-app-that-does-x-y-and-z-a-valid-question).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's reasonable. I am afraid, though, that "enough detail" is subjective and going to be hard to manage.


















It may also be helpful to enumerate what type of devices are on-topic.


Android phones (obviously)
Android tablets (new and upcoming)


What about e-book readers? The B&N Nook is based on Android. (None of the others currently on the market is Android.)

Google TV is built on Android. I'm actually surprised we haven't gotten any questions about it already. Is it allowed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**I'd say anything as it relates to Android.**  We're probably not the best place for most Nook specific questions, but chances are that most of the people that aren't hacking into the device don't even know its running Android and won't ask us how to bookmark their favorite passage in their vampire romance novel.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it worth stating where we stand on ChromeOS, it's already come up in a meta question once but I haven't seen a consensus? It's worth thinking about before the first question is posted, particularly as more manufacturers put Android on netbooks, and there's likely nothing going to stop someone putting ChromeOS  on a tablet, the lines are likely to get more and more blurred in the future. (previous Chrome mention http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/223/discussion-on-the-google-stack-exchange-proposal )


















I believe this is a shopping question and should not be allowed.

I think you should allow the question if is Android centric. 

For example, I often have discussions with people like: what is the latest version of android available on a stock phone... 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're in the wrong spot. You want to share that at http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/246/faq-what-kind-of-questions-should-i-ask-here


















I'd group OS versions in as being the same sort of potentially meta info as phone models.

I'd argue that with the number of times when the phone's model or OS version is important, but not mentioned anywhere the tags are useful, even when just pointers to the fact that the phone has a particular custom UI, or capabilities.

If the question is in anyway hardware related, then they're essential. If it's to do with UI or built-in apps then, again they're useful (the Contacts app on a Sense UI phone is different from a TouchWiz phone, and from a pure Android phone in many ways).

They may be meta-information but the information is useful enough in enough cases that without it I think we'd need to encourage use of more general meta tags (eg HTC-phone, or Dell-tablet, or HTC-Sense or Samsung-TouchWiz) but in many cases the questioner, if not an Android expert may not know that they have Sense, but will likely know that they have a Desire.

Do people really ignore all htc-desire tagged posts just because they have a Sony Xperia phone?

If we started getting people tagging posts with beginner-question, or expert-question then that's a different matter. Rather than forcing someone who may not know exactly what the problem is to decide what info is or isn't relevant, I think we should be encouraging question askers to give as much info as they can, and tags are one way to provide that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5but the purpose of the tag is for sorting/classification, not for description. If they are relevant to the question but not relevant to classification, I think the poster should only mention that in the description not in the tags


















I think OS version tags can meaningfully describe the content -- but I only support adding them when the poster (or an editor) thinks they are relevant to that particular question.

I'd definitely discourage any policy, implicit or explicit, of mindlessly tagging all posts with an OS version. They do this on http://ask.ubuntu.comhttp://ask.ubuntu.com and it has been kind of a bad idea in practice.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5but the purpose of the tag is for sorting/classification, not for description. If they are relevant to the question but not relevant to classification, I think the poster should only mention that in the description not in the tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Louis A classification is a kind of description, in my mind.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, correct, but a description is not always a classification. What I am proposing to discourage is tags that are descriptive but not a classification, such as the examples in the original question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Any description is a classification if used as such -- for example, when used as a tag.  ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The situation has become a bit worse, in my opinion. An awful lot of questions are using device and/or OS specific tags that shouldn't. In most cases it's universal. What the asker is doing is categorizing their device and not their question. I don't think there's anything for it but to encourage seasoned veterans to edit those tags off when they find them.


















I definitely see now why it makes sense not to do this kind of tagging -- clicking the tag will show you all the questions where the user has Device X, when you really want to see all the questions about Device X.

That said, many questions need device and OS info, and the tags are a convenient place to put it, for consistency reasons.  The information is always in the same place and clearly distinct from the question, so the potential answerer doesn't have to search the question for it (or remember it all as they read the question).

I think the optimal solution would be to have separate fields for device and OS version that the asker could fill in if it's relevant.  The info could be shown in a separate box or something at the end of the question.  I'm not sure how much work this would be for the SE people or if it's desirable to modify this site / some sites this way, since it's clearly not applicable across the board.  Perhaps instead the FAQ could show a standard template that people should insert at the end of their question, something like:


Device: <make> <model> [sub_model]
OS Version: <#.#-version_name>
[ROM: <ROM_name>]
[Custom UI: <UI_name>]

There are tags for photos, photo, and pictures. These should probably be all photos.

At least one of the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/picturespictures posts is about image files in general, not just photos. I'll make the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photophoto synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photosphotos. I'll look to see if https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/picturespictures should be synonym'd to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/imagesimages.

Update: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photophoto is now a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photosphotos. I changed all of the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/picturespictures to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/imagesimages but I'm not sure it should be a synonym. I also changed all but one https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/imageimage to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/imagesimages; that one was about making an "image" of the phone, but other tags existed which covered the topic, so I just removed it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good work.  Someone could definitely tag "picture[s]" and mean "photo[s]" so I agree it's not necessarily a synonym of "image[s]".


















This site is great, and I like helping people, but keeping a laser-like focus means we have to turn people away.

Do you think it would be worthwhile to have a Community Wiki question with answers pointing to a variety of other resources? Here are the types of things I can think of off the top of my head:


Developer resources
Official sites
Blogs
Comparison sites
Forums


What do you think?

Update: Considering https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/269/other-android-resources/271#271Jeff's Answer, let's come up with a few resources that can fill these niches. Shopping comparison sites will be especially useful.



See: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questions/Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?

Seems like a good idea, and reminds me of...
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8401/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-stack-overflow-questionshttps://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8401/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-stack-overflow-questions
Which starts with

Thank you for your confidence in our abilities! But have you read the Stack Overflow FAQ?
We get a lot of IT/network/computer/technical questions on here, but Stack Overflow is meant to be first and foremost a programmer's resource.
Yes, someone here might be able to help you, but you'll find that other forums more focused on your topic can give you a much better answer than a bunch of programmers. It's likely that your question will be downvoted, closed, and in some cases marked "offensive." It's not that we hate you, it's just that we're programmers and we like to keep our corn pops separate from our cocoa puffs.

I can see an android-flavored version of that getting plenty of traction.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like it. I'll work on putting something together.


















I'm inclined to think they're off-topic.  It's one thing if it's a carrier-specific question that is also Android-specific (an example fails me at the moment), but the example you mention has nothing to do with Android; the user just happens to have an Android phone.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agree, they come under the "Too Localized" condition pretty much by definition. Even worse the questioner there is not even interested in the whole country, just Vermont, and the whole question of area codes is totally irrelevant to many countries where mobile phones have their own codes and aren't tied down to geographic area codes.

Bryan Denny also created an https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-phoneindex of rooting how-tos on the internet.

What do you think is the best way to consolidate these? One question per device or a single question for everything?

UPDATE: 

Here are a few specific open questions:


What do you think is the best format? 


One huge question and one answer for every device (simple to maintain, but too many methods to list on one page)
One large "index" question that links to a question for each device, with one huge answer for all methods for the single device (I think this strikes the best balance between maintainability and being too crowded) 
One large "index" question that links to a question for each device, with one answer for each method (my personal preference, though it may be difficult to maintain, as there will be hundreds of answer nodes)
One large "index" question that links to a question for each method and each method is preambled with the devices that is supported with the method (might be a little hard to navigate, but easiest to maintain as answers don't need to be duplicated if an exact same method works on multiple devices, e.g. One click root)
other ideas?

Where to put the questions?


I personally prefer the "index" question to be on Bryan Denny's page, but it is also possible to create a new Q. 

What to if there is already a good resource outside A.SE? Should we quote/summarizes the most important part here or simply linking is good enough?

I don't think a canonical question will work, unfortunately, since rooting techniques vary wildly across devices (unless I am misunderstanding what a canonical question is).  I think a Community Wiki question work quite well though, with an entry for each device.  Something like:

Device X


2.1-eclair


Method 1


Do this
Do that



.


Method 2


Do this



.
2.2-froyo


Do this


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Canonical Question, is just a good question and answer that are taken by the community, improved, added to, and made more useful to more people (probably by having the specifics taken out and general info put in). Essentially it is just a community wiki, but one looked after and done well, and one that future questioners can be pointed to to give them their answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks :) I was thinking it was more of a "This is the one right answer" type of thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also like the idea that we have a community wiki question about rooting *per device*. One big question would get to confusing.


















It looks like Bryan Denny's https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-phoneHow do I root my phone? would be a perfect place to consolidate this, and a great resource to point all the rooting question-askers at.

If he's happy for his answer to be Community Wiki'd, then it could be treated as a shared resource to put all the info in, the same way that the "When is my phone getting [OS]" questions are pointed to the two "https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2696/when-will-my-phone-get-the-android-2-2-update-froyoWhen will my phone get the Android 2.2 update (FroYo)?" (and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2695/when-will-my-phone-get-the-android-2-3-update-gingerbreadGingerbread) questions started by Al Everett.

That way all of the normal "How Do I Root" questions can be closed and pointed to Bryan's question, and the more unusual edge-cases can be treated on a case-by-case basis to see if they'll stand as their own separate question (but probably still with a link back to the main rooting question),
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that's the best solution. He already has links for specific models.


















Per this question https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/43/whats-the-policy-on-linking-to-non-market-appsWhat's the policy on linking to non-market apps? I think we're all agreed that linking to an app on a warez-type alternative market-place is something we don't want to do.

How about when something like this question happens:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1113/is-appbucket-a-legal-app-store/4577#4577Is appbucket a legal app store? - Totally legitimate question from someone who's seen a deal that looks too good to be true, and wants to know if the site is legitimate or not.

However he's linking to the site in question in the question. this obviously makes it easier for question answerers to find the site and investigate it, so is ok in the initial question.

In this case where the community have decided that this site definitely looks shady and appears to be distributing cracked, warez versions of apps without reimbursing the authors, do we want to give that site the exposure and benefits of a link from us? Should we go back and edit the question to remove the link and just leave the site name?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Policy on linking to questionable/illegal/warez download sitesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about linking to alternative methods of getting free apps that are only allowed on certain devices/networks?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From the previous question, if they're on a legitimate alternative Market site, then OK. If from the author's own site OK. And then there's things like when someone on XDA pulls a custom keyboard or live wallpaper APK or something from a newly released phone's ROM, they've been allowed so far. From copyright terms that's definitely a grey area, maybe worth discussing more?


















Well, the link is using rel="nofollow", so the site's not getting any googlejuice.

Just because there's a link to a site does not mean that Stack Exchange or the members of the Android Enthusiasts site endorse it, and I don't think anyone would think that.

Also, anyone who doesn't follow safe browsing is not going to be protected by us. Without a link it would be academic to find the site via other means.

If the link went somewhere other than what it purported to (goatse anyone?) then it might be a problem. As is I don't think it is a problem.

I'm interested in other opinions, however.

"Answers" posted in comments are fair game to be reposted as real answers.

You can attribute the answer to the commenter, but there's no defensible reason to not post an answer as an answer.. we have the opposite problem (comments as answers) all the time, but that's because commenting requires 50 rep, and answering requires none.

That's a personal rule of thumb. YMMV. It's about getting the answers, not leading everybody by the hand all the time...


















I agree with Aaronaught but I'd like to add a criteria in determining the quality of such questions: 

Can the question be answered by a simple search of the Market?  

If it can, then the asker shouldn't ask it they should use that energy to search the market.  An example of this could be...


  Is there an app that lets me use my LED flash as a flashlight?
  
  I need an app that will turn my phone
  into a flashlight.


This should never be asked. Simple searching "LED flashlight" brings up numerous apps that do exactly that.

Here's an example of a what I consider an acceptable app recommendation question:


  GPS app that will track my movements and record route, distance, time &
  elevation?
  
  Is there an app that will track and
  record my bike tours and accurately
  record the route, distance &
  elevation, and the time I was at each
  point of the route?  I also need to
  be able to view these recorded tours
  on my computer afterwards so I need a
  PC component or a way to export the data into a
  format that's compatible with some 3rd
  party GPS tour software like
  MyTourBook.  I've tried MyTracks and
  GPS Tracker however neither of them
  seem to accurately measure my
  elevation or the time that I was at
  certain points along my route.


You could search for GPS apps in the market but it would be difficult to parse out which apps effectively meet the complex set of criteria above.  While this is a fairly specific request, it's not obscure.  I can see a lot of applications for an app that meets said criteria so I think it's likely that others have searched for this and will in the future.

Who's asking what?  In your scenario is the question asker asking the community what they've already searched or are we the community asking a question asker (in the comments) what they've already searched?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To clarify: Someone asks if there is an app that does "X". I leave a comment asking what search criteria they used to search the Market. They say they haven't searched. We say "go try a search or two and come back and let us know what you find".


















I don't think we should consolidate.  As Matthew Read pointed out "rooting techniques vary wildly across devices" and to add to that, they often change.  What works today may not work tomorrow after an OTA.  Also, there are new devices being released every month.  Creating a community wiki one stop shop for questions like "When will my device get Froyo?" is fine because the answer for each device is 2 lines long.  The answer to just one "How to I root my XXX?" can be very lengthy on it's own.  

Two years from now when I'm looking for info on how to root my Kenmore Washer/Dryer Combo that's running Android 8.1 I don't want to have to sort through the instructions on how to root a G1 or the hundreds of other devices that aren't relevant to me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When saying "consolidating", I was actually thinking more along the lines of having a single "index" question that links to other device-specific questions, with each device-specific questions having a single answer for each rooting method. Votes will then indicate how many people successfully (or unsuccessfully) used the method and thus the success rate of the method.


















These two questions were asked back in android.SE's infancy:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/56/can-you-recommend-some-alternative-keyboards-for-androidCan you recommend some alternative keyboards for Android?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/247/what-is-the-best-alternative-to-the-stock-camera-app-closedWhat is the best alternative to the stock camera app?


They were both flagged today as too subjective and I believe those flaggers were right.  Considering how long they've been around and how much interaction they've gotten do you think they should be closed or made community wikis?

I actually already closed the second one, which was my question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we close these old "Subjective" & "List" questions or make them community wikis?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm tempted to open a Meta question questioning the mental stability of our mods, after I saw one talking to himself in comments...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am familiar with that mod, and there is no need to question it.

Well, on meta.stackoverflow they use faq-proposed. Seems reasonable to me.

Especially since some people have already started using it: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/faq-proposedhttps://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/faq-proposed

So we seem to get questions every now and then from people who want to know about running Android on devices that originally came with some other OS (normally some flavour of WinMobile). Normally we aren't much more help to the asker than pointing them at some year-old thread on XDA, if we can even be that helpful.

Is there anything more we can do here, can we create a central "these non-Android phones can run Android" post, or is it not worth the effort?

There's also the occasional (how) can I install Android on my PC/laptop, should we also treat these the same?

This is a followup to Matt's question https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/199/questions-that-are-on-the-fence-between-development-and-power-useQuestions that are on the fence between development and power use In that question, there is a general agreement that we "keep a big tent" and allow some types of Android development questions. This meta question seeks to establish a line between Android Development questions that should be accepted here and questions which are definitely off topic.

It has been acknowledged from time to time that certain development questions are best fit in Android.SE than StackOverflow or Programmers.SE; when we closed those sort of questions here and send it to SO, they often get closed again on SO and get sent back to us. Getting ping-ponged like that feels just like those crappy customer service (we can do better than those poor guys, can't we?). Additionally, as Matt pointed in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/199/questions-that-are-on-the-fence-between-development-and-power-useQuestions that are on the fence between development and power use, developers are often very well suited to answer certain definitely-on-topic questions, so it is best for A.SE to attract some Android developers. However, we also do not want this to be a full-fledged developer site.

Here's what I think:

Development Question to keep at Android.SE:


How do I upload apps to Market?
What programming/scripting languages can I use to program for Android?
When is Android x.x SDK going to be released? (as GAThrawn pointed out, this question is speculative since Google usually do not announces their SDK release dates)
What API Level/SDK version is feature X introduced?
How to use developer tool X (e.g. ADB) for non-developer use Y (e.g. side-loading apps)
How to use {Android-specific shell command (e.g. pm, am)}?
How to change X in custom ROM Y?


Borderline (determine on case-by-case basis):


Why does program X, which says it received Intent Y, is not receiving my Intent Y?
Why is my GPS application not getting good location in Android X, though it worked perfectly in Android Y?


Development Question to migrate to somewhere else:


Help me figure out how to write this algorithm for my Android app (off-topic to Stackoverflow)
How do I write {syntax X} in my Java Android program (off-topic to Stackoverflow)
Which is the better UI (off-topic to UI.SE)
How to use {linux shell command (e.g. toolbox/busybox commands)}? (Unix.SE)


Bad SE question:


As Android users, what do you think of application doing X or doing Y? (market research, close and suggest discussion forums or reddits)


What do you think? Anything you disagree with?

Have a longer answer for the rest, will post later.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn: Good point, now that I think backwards, Google never announces its SDK announcement date.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a pretty good set of guidelines.


















I would say it's on topic-ish, since the goal of the asker is to use and enjoy Android.

Isn't that an implicit shared goal of everyone here?

As long as it's asked in good faith and is of reasonable quality, I would allow it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. Trouble is that we don't seem to have anyone here that can answer those questions, except perhaps those that troll the xda forums, and the asker could do that just as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd rather let the community grow up to fill the need, than to try and change the need to fit the current state of the community.


















I don't think that question is a shopping recommendation or off topic.  He is not asking if he should buy a phone or a particular plan.  He's asking if a phone can reasonably be used without using more than 150 MB of data per month and to provide context he has mentioned that this is the criteria that he's using to decide whether or not to buy a particular phone/data plan.

He could have phrased it like this: 


  Is it possible for a phone to be used regularly and not go over 150 MB
  of data in a month
  
  I realize that I could just turn the
  phone off and it wouldn't use any data
  but is it possible to use a phone on a
  regular basis and stay under 150 MB
  per month or is the fact that the
  phone is on and doing background syncs
  going to use more than that much data?


... at it's core this question is asking the same thing as the one I mentioned above.  It clearly wouldn't be a shopping recommendation.

Here's another way it could have been phrased:


  Should I get a 150 MB per month or and unlimited data plan?
  
  I'm looking for a phone to make phone
  calls, text and light internet use. 
  Should I get the Unlimiated data or
  would I be fine getting the metered
  plan?


This is a shopping recommendation.  The questions are very similar but I think that at it's core this question is distinctly different.  The second one is asking the community to make decision for him and tell him what to purchase.  The question in question here was not asking us to make a decision for him, it was asking whether a certain theorized use was practical and/or possible because he felt that it was an important criteria in making his own decision.

While I think that phrasing is important, I think we can use a little discretion to determine what the heart of the question is and not require that question askers contort their questions to follow a strict phrasing criteria, simply to avoid using words that are related to off-topic questions.

To summarize:


Asking if you should buy something or which something you should buy = Shopping Recommendation = Off Topic = Kill it
Asking about a particular feature, function... that you are going to use as criteria in your purchasing decision = OK

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems to me that asking if 150MB is "enough" can't be objective. Everyone's usage pattern is going to be different. I agree that this isn't subjective enough to close. You're right though: it's all about the phrasing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My point about phrasing is actually that it's actually **not** all about phrasing.  Phrasing is important but this isn't a programming language, so we shouldn't be slaves to a strict phrasing structure that holds syntax above meaning and throws common sense out the window.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5right -- teach me how to fish, versus, bring me a fish -- as described in http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So in cases like this should we edit the original question's phrasing to make it into an on-topic question that can be answered, or should it be left to live or die by the original asker's wording?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My point was I have no problem with the way it was worded.  Could it be better? Probably.  Is it a shopping rec? No.  Is it on topic?  I think so.  Should we edit it?  I don't think so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think your second version of the question would need to be edited, though.  I think most people wouldn't mind if you left a comment explaining your rationale and asking the user if it still fit their problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@matthew read: I agree. I have no problem with the wording of the original question. The second example was supposed to be an example of an off topic shopping rec that would need editing or closing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As the author of the question being discussed, should I re-write it as "Is it possible for a phone to be used regularly and not go over 150 MB of data in a month", or is it fine as is?


















Considering https://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/community-wikihttps://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/community-wiki,


  When should I make my answers Community Wiki?
  
  
  When you want to enhance the "wiki" aspect of your post, so that it can be
  a continually evolving source of good
  information through repeated editing.
  When you feel your post would benefit from less concern about voting
  affecting the reputation of those
  participating in it
  


should the following questions be made CW?  I am specifically concerned about point #1, since these canonical questions will benefit from regular updates:

I suggest a similar approach as with dev questions (as discussed in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/299/development-questions-where-to-draw-the-lineDevelopment Questions: where to draw the line), where:


User questions about how they can access content is on topic
Advice on the "Android audience" or questions more about media tech than Android are offtopic
Questions such as the example in this question where it's borderline are determined on a case-by-case basis.


I personally think the example is on topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agree, and that particular example only needs a couple of words changed and then it would be a totally on topic "How can I do XXX on my phone" type question that no one would question at all.

I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes?

Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it just me but I can't see the QR codes on the app detail pages?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see them in the right panel right under the price.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(added a screen shot)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are various SE sites that have their own tweaks, it doesn't need to be universal.  And I can definitely see the odd case where a "Learn English on the Go" app or something is linked from English.SE.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see the QR code. Must be limited to US only or something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok I finally see the QR code... weird. No need for the QR code implementation then :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Plus when you go to the page there's a link to install the app on your phone so you don't even have to take your phone out of your pocket.  To be honest, I think QR codes are kinda cool but I never use them.


















We can now at least use direct links to Market apps that use a normal URL scheme and will work as links on both the phone and your PC. 

No need to use a market://.... link, we can use  http://market.android.com/http://market.android.com/....

Eg this link should take you to the app's Market page on a normal web browser, and if clicked from an Android browser should take you into the app's page in the Market app:

http://market.android.com/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirdshttp://market.android.com/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirds

What's more the Android market web pages even have a QR code on them. Anyone know if there'd be a problem embedding the QRs from the Market server in here, they use the normal Ggoogle Charts API to create the QR, like this:

http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=100x100&chld=|0&cht=qr&chl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarket.android.com%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.rovio.angrybirdshttp://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=100x100&chld=|0&cht=qr&chl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarket.android.com%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.rovio.angrybirds

Which in an image link gives us:



Which should all be a lot more useful (and less confusing to the casual visitor) than sending someone to Appbrain, or the like.

I can type into the search box, but I can't seem to get it to submit. When I click the Enter or OK buttons it just seems to change focus to another field.

Similarly, I can't figure out how to close the messaging bar at the top of the screen. I can't scroll far enough to the right to close it.

Not sure if it matters, but this is with a Motorola Flipside running 2.1.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I search this site from my phone?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just tried to edit the question to post some screenshots but the image upload overlay was also an exercise in frustration that ended in disappointment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The issues you're seeing are, of course, endemic to the whole Stack Exchange network, not just this site. You may wish to post about them on the "[Mother Ship](http://meta.stackoverflow.com)", as that's where the Stack Exchange team will more likely be found. I'm sure they want to hear about how the sites work (or not, in this case) with a mobile browser.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hard to say whether they'll care, though, since it mostly works on the 2.2 browser.


















I wouldn't even bother with the search function here. While they've recently improved it, Google (and even other web searches) are still far superior.

site:android.stackexchange.com searchterm in your Android/Google search field should find you what you need.

As for the other issues, this site isn't optimized for mobile browsers (seems like a no-brainer to me) so that there are "wonky" things with the interface doesn't surprise me, nor do I think they'll be a high priority. However, someone has created a mobile-optimized "proxy" for the Stack Exchange network, called Stack Mobile. You might try that and see if that works better for you.

Sounds like you're seeing the same as we used to see on Galaxy S's when they were running 2.1, see this question on the main site:

I did not do the downvote, but I think that question is downvoted because the question is not an Android question and so is out-of-topic for this site. Also, even assuming that it is on-topic, the question does not provide enough details to provide any useful answer, such as who your carrier is and device you are using.

But, don't take the downvote too personally, people downvote for various reasons:


they deemed the question out of topic (e.g. carrier-specific, subjective)
they think the question is poorly phrased (e.g. does not have enough information to be usefully answered, or have powr speeling)
they deemed the question inappropriate (spams, etc)
they accidentally clicked the downvote and cannot change it since their vote is now locked (this is a problem with the system)
they just do not like the question, for whatever their own personal or political alignment (we do not like this, but there is nothing that can be done)


A single downvote does not mean the community is rejecting the question any more than a single vote means you're going to be the next president.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I get the generic up/down-vote system. I posed the question mainly as a discussion of the merits of the question mostly because I'm new to the Android.SE and I want to understand what drives the community. I'm not a big fan of the other forums that are out there for Android and I'm hoping this will become the defacto resource for android.. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to answer!


















What you really need is somewhere with something more like a discussion forum, than this Q&A site, also that place needs to already have an active community of developers hanging around and actively contributing.

I don't think that this sort of thing is relevant here, but it is certainly something that another website could (or perhaps already does) do. I think you'd have trouble getting a new site up and running to do this, as it will be very easy to attract people with ideas ()perhaps even demands) for new apps, but quite hard to attract the necessary experienced and motivated developers. You'd need a site that already has a big enough community of devs with spare time on their hands to bootstrap your idea.

Having said all that, there have been a couple of times lately when someone asked for an app that doesn't exist, and a member or two here have gone off and written one (https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5320/is-there-an-app-that-will-list-my-phones-info-in-an-easily-copy-paste-able-formathis one springs to mind), but that is very rare simply because most people here are Android Users, rather than Android Developers. StackOverflow does have the developer community, but requests for new apps would definitely be off-topic there.

XDA is one place that could do this, but currently doesn't - I think they do allow requests for new custom ROMS and changes to existing ones, particularly for models that haven't got one yet, but as they don't specialize in app development they may not be willing to expand in that direction.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For commercial software, I don't think it has to be an existing community, it could be a service provided to developers (by the Market team or AppBrain). "Why develop an app with an uncertain demand when you can build stuff people have already asked for?"


















Unfortunately "drive-by downvotes" do happen. If there's only one down-vote, and no one's left any explanation, then I'd just re-read my question/answer make sure everything's as clear and accurate as I can make it, and then shrug it off and ignore the down-vote.

It's not a serious matter and as Lie says, if you've only got one down-vote, then the majority of the community have no problem with your question.

Most experienced community members here regularly leave comments on questions or answers they may think aren't as clear as they could be, or may not belong here, often without down-voting initially. So it's very unlikely to be one of them who've down-voted you.

Ultimately, unless the down-voter comes here and explains their reasoning, we're really all just guessing why they did it.

Your particular question, I thought was possibly border-line whether it should be here or not, but there was no way that you (or we) could know if it was ontopic or not, without having an answer to that tells us where the sim-lock is, and whether it's Android specific. It's a bit "chicken-and-egg" you can't tell if it's ontopic until someone answers to say it is (or not), and you may not always get a good answer if someone thinks it's off-topic. Personally I'd say on-topic, obviously someone disagreed.

I'm glad you see my point though (the chicken-and-egg analogy was nice)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ironically, I accidentally clicked the down-vote on this answer and almost didn't notice it.


















I'm not commenting on the up/down vote as much as the assertion that several people have made that it's off-topic.  It very well may not be an Android specific question when you know the answer but I think it's clear by the way he phrased it, that he didn't know that it's not Android specific.  Personally, I think it's sufficiently related to the use of Android phones not to warrant "Off-topic" votes, especially when it's clear that the OP thinks it may be Android specific.

I agree, this isn't the place for it but it would be nice if there was another venue with the same format as SE.  I absolutely despise traditional forums for all the extraneous bs that you have to wade through to find any useful info.  Something like this would really need a voting platform like SE has to let the cream rise to the top.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that's the idea behind http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/ and other similar sites, the voting lets people choose what they want and helps developers determines what's in demand


















Looking at https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5713/are-there-any-coding-training-games-for-android/5718#5718this answer which essentially says "No, there is not an app" but got comments saying "You know for a fact there are no coding games for Android?" implying that to answer "No" you must provide proof that none of the 200K android apps meet your needs.

Compared to https://android.stackexchange.com/q/5704/2199this question which has no answers, but a comment that says "I've also looked and have not seen anything available at the moment.".   That comment is logically an answer, but it is an answer that says "No" and was posted by a mod.

Is there a preferred way to answer "No" to "Is there an App that does ABC?"?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When is it appropriate to answer "no" to "is there an app that does ABC?" questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While it might be better to not have answers instead of a "no", there's no way to tell if a question is simply neglected or if people have looked and failed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Keep in mind that, strictly speaking, "Is there an app for X?" is offtopic.  Better to say "How can I do X?" and you may get an app as an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead I think that should be made explicit on the [faq](http://android.stackexchange.com/faq) page.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree.  That should be done when we're out of beta, much like Gaming has "Can I ask for shopping recommendations?" in their FAQ.


















Often you can find other sources (even if just forum posts, etc) supporting the assertion that no app for ABC exists or, better still, posts explaining why it is not (currently) possible if there is some technical block to having such an app.

Where you can cite this kind of supporting evidence, I would think you are better placed to provide a genuine answer.

Without any supporting evidence, where the answer really is just "I can't find one", then my preference would be for a comment.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree.  A universal negative cannot be proved ;)


















Another take: Stack Exchange is focused on having answers that are relevant long-term.  A "No" is only relevant until someone make an app, whereas a "Yes, X" is always relevant because even if the app is removed from the Market, there's a timestamp on the answer.

A "No" also doesn't help the user with their problem, unless their problem is "I can't stop searching unless told not to" :P
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's a good point. I still think that especially where the current unavailability can be attributed to a specific technical limitation then that's a solid answer. Whilst that might change in future, at least the answer can be given with the context, e.g. "not possible in Froyo because...". Hard for answers to be totally future proof, especially with the rate of development on Android :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Absolutely. A reason makes everything better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree, some users always have to keep asking questions to which most of us instinctively know there is no solution. They should know that they're pushing the boundaries too far and it's not possible unless they hack it together themselvesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Ivo I don't think we're in a position to judge what someone else *should* know. If the question is inappropriate, it should be closed. If the user is truly abusive, they should be banned.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that after seeing a couple thousand of questions, you get a pretty good sense for BS-detection. The problem with those questions is that they look like real questions, but constantly fail to get answered, because there aren't any! Either way, I'm sure it's being handled fine as it is right now


















Better to say "not at this time" or "not that I have found".

Because there very well might not be an app that does what the asker wants.

Maybe no one has built it. Maybe it's just not possible with the state of the OS and hardware. At least, as it currently exists.

It would be better if askers described what problem they're trying to solve rather than asking for an app. There might be solutions they haven't considered.



This shows up one of the problems with shopping recommendations. Personally, I have come around to thinking that "I need an app that does X, Y, or Z" should be closed as off-topic, while a better question would be "How can I do X, Y and Z".

I mean, unless I have actually used an app that does exactly what they're asking for, in order to answer their question I'm just going to the Market and searching on some of their keywords. They can do that. Instead of crafting their own good search, they've finagled me into doing it for them. This site is about helping Android Enthusiasts use their devices, not helping people learn to search.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agree, you can't ever say a definitive no when what you mean is "Not yet" or "Not that I can find"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that "none that I have found" cannot be accepted as an anwser, exactly like "I don't know". Also Stackexchange aims at building _long term_ knowledge base, so "Not at this time" is not acceptable either.


















This morning I didn't have Mod Tools on AE, this afternoon I get a banner saying I do, and they do seem to be there. I'm currently at 4,309 rep and according to the Recent Activity page I've only gained 10 rep so far today.

Pretty sure that last time I looked Mod Tools on the parent site still needed 10K (they're much lower on Meta, I've had them here for a while).

Can't see any new Stackoverflow/Exchange blog posts yet, was this a deliberate change for still in beta sites, or just a bug that's happening on my account?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have the Rep requirements for Mod Tools suddenly changed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5definitely not an isolated incident, this happened to me as wellb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The [FAQ](http://android.stackexchange.com/faq) for AE now lists wildly different rep levels than it used to. They don't line up with any of the levels in the [When Will My Site Graduate?](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/when-will-my-site-graduate/) blog post, either, but that makes it seem like it might be deliberate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, while in beta and trying to gain momentum, there are far too few users who have the ability to do "useful" tasks. There are the diamond mods and then a huge drop-off in abilities. We can't do it all; we need your help. This is a welcome change, I think.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agree, it's a good idea during beta, probably would have been more worthwhile in the long period where Bryan was the only person here with over 2K rep. Rather than now where there's at least a handful of non-mods who've had Edit All and Vote to close privileges for a bit (as those were previously at 2k and 3K).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just got Tools as well, with no notification.  Strange.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, just got the notification.  Bizarre.


















I asked the other StackExchange moderators and they say that the https://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/moderator-toolsmod tools appear for 2k rep on beta sites.  Otherwise I'd say the alert is just being wonky of telling you about the tools.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Mod tools were always supposed to be 2k for beta sites, but the other rep levels look different than [when they were last discussed on the blog](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/when-will-my-site-graduate/). Vote to close, for example, looks to have dropped from 1k to 500.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think they were like that early in the beta period, but got changed around the time WebApps migrated. Perhaps in error. We've also been in beta longer than the "standard" 90 days and perhaps they didn't account for that. Obviously, something has been fixed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This has definitely changed in the last day, I wasn't getting the "Tools" link at the top of the page on the main site until this lunchtime.


















Closed questions aren't necessarily supposed to stay around forever.

On the non-Beta Stack Exchange sites, two days after a question is closed a "Delete" link goes live on the question, allowing users with more than 10K reputation to vote to delete. (This two day window allows the Asker an opportunity to edit their question and vote to re-open.)

Only some closed messages should be kept around. Duplicates should normally be kept in order to maximize the search terms that can be used to find the information. Questions that are almost exact duplicates should be merged.

Almost everything else, though, should be deleted. After all, if it had worth it wouldn't have been closed. If you think it did have worth, of course, vote to re-open.

In any event, your moderators can't be everywhere at once. If you see an old, closed (non-duplicate) question that needs deletion and you can't vote to delete yourself, please flag it for our attention.

Edit: Perhaps now that we have a bunch more people who can vote to delete, maybe we can get rid of some more of the egregiously awful questions. I like to use https://android.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&q=closed%3a1this search and go to the last page to get the lowest-voted questions. Of course, not all of them deserve deletion (and the "closed as duplicate" should stay) but it's a good place to start. Or, if you've a mind to see what else other people have voted on there's the https://android.stackexchange.com/tools?s=1&tab=delete&daterange=delete tool.

In most questions on AE, one of the more common comments below a question usually are to ask the questioner details regarding his/her device - 


what device are you using? 
what version of Android is your device running?
Are you rooted?


These questions and the answers to them invariably help a great deal toward answering or focusing a prospective solution to what would be relevant for that particular user.

Is there any way we can set up these fields within a user's profile (with a request to fill in details - not mandatory at all), so it shows below a user's display icon or on hover?

Else can we include a separate field like there is for the tags for a user's device info etc?

Is android.stackexchange.com the correct place to ask a question about whether I should upgrade or fix a broken nexus one? I nearly posted a question, but I'm not sure if this is the right place for that. What does the community think? My main worry is that it's fairly open ended and subjective. There's not really a "right" answer, however, the feedback given (especially if well justified) could be very helpful to me and others in a similar situation.

I think the question to ask is, can this be generalized to help others in the future, and if so, how much?

Otherwise it's basically a shopping question:

It seems like the "answers" would be useful only to a very small subset of people and the answers would depend on the current state of the market (as in which phones are currently available to upgrade to) so it would have very limited applicability going forward..

Hi all. I'm http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/Jin, and I'll be working on the designs for the Stack Exchange sites as they graduate from the beta phase. Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.

I'm in the very early stage of brainstorming for design concepts of the Android.SE's official theme. I want to pitch some of my ideas to the community before I start t designing. 


Overall look and feel: modern, clean and minimalist. The site should feel similar to the http://speckyboy.com/2010/05/10/android-app-developers-gui-kits-icons-fonts-and-tools/user interface elements found in most Android phones.
Use the http://www.android.com/branding.htmlAndroid robot as favicon or part of the header image, since we're allowed to use it legally.
Color scheme: white with black, yellow and green accent colors. Green from the Android Robot (#A4C639)
Typography: I'd like to use http://code.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Droid+Sans&subset=latinDroid Sans as the header and body text(via @font-face). However I need to make sure the font renders smoothly at a smaller size on Windows. 


Please let me know what you think. Also feel free to post your own ideas. One thing I need to stress is that I'd like to focus on ONE overall look and feel. For now I feel the modern and slick one works well, since it represents Android UI. Feel free to disagree, but explain your argument.

Here are some of my questions for smaller details:


What should the tag and badge treatment be?
What should be used for the 404/error/captcha page images? I'm thinking about using the Android Robot for these, to keep a whimsical theme.
What are some of the Android related sites out there that you like(design wise). I've looked at quite a few, but haven't found any that stands out for me. Keep in mind, while I want the our site to look "Android-ish," but it's also important to give this community a distinct identity.


That's all, thanks!

The standard StackExchange theme very not mobile friendly, and certain UI elements (e.g. the notification bar) is a usability mess on a mobile browser (in particular, the notification bar has the habit of not being easily closable since the close button keeps moving away from you and it completely covers the login button).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lie we don't have any plans for a mobile version yet. but members from our stackapps.com community have created mobile apps using our APIs. for example: http://stackmobile.comb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin: Android's Browser is quite capable of rendering the regular stackexchange, that much is fine. However there do exists some annoyances due to having small screen and touchscreen, such as the floating notification bar. While a true mobile version of StackExchange would require rethinking everything from the ground up (and with many other Betas waiting to launch, you probably won't have time to design a true mobile version), it shouldn't be too difficult to just hide the notification bar when a mobile device is detected, right? The problem with stackmobile is that it is read-only.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apologies in advance as I'm sure I'm being thick or something, but: "For now I feel the modern and slick one works well" - which modern and slick what now? :osb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin: Do you suppose we could get an update and, maybe, a speculative guess at a completion date? Not trying to rush you; just trying to see where we are.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al We look at the weekly stats to decide which site to launch next. Of course these stats change each week.

I much prefer a sans font, so I think that's a good choice.

As for badges/tags, it'd by nice if they were similar to the standard buttons.

A smaller version of  with text might serve for badges. Change the color in the center for bronze/silver/gold.

The buttons here  are definitely viable for both. They gray/silver could be for normal tags, the yellow for featured tags.

How about this?  It's actually an arm from the Android mascot.

Perhaps not as in-your-face green, but the radius of the curve evokes Android.

I'd like to reserve the 3d buttony look for actual buttons only so there's no confusion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, then.

Other places you might look to for inspiration: There is an Android http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=112508Gmail theme, a https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.htmlChrome theme as well as several themes for iGoogle (though these last are unofficial).

None of the Android blogs I read have designs that really "inspire". http://www.androidtapp.com/AndroidTapp looks the best (I think) but is not overtly "androidy". 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5r/android on reddit is another example.  It isn't too over the top. http://www.reddit.com/r/android


















You probably had a reputation re-calc. The number on your profile doesn't change immediately when a question or answer (where you had upvotes/downvotes) is deleted.

I do know that a number of old, closed, off-topic questions were deleted recently.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't know the deletion of a question affected positive rep.  Good to know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And it's happened again. From around 1912 or so, I'm down to 1702. This certainly rates as "odd behaviour" in my book.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another possibility: vote fraud. The system does check for unusual voting patterns, like a lot of up or down votes by one person for another in a short amount of time. When it sees those sorts of patterns it rolls back the votes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note that there's nothing you can do about that @Sparx, so it's not to punish you, rather to prevent users from fraudulently upvoting every answer from a single user


















Indeed, anyone can propose edits to a question or answer. For those with insufficient privileges to edit outright, these proposed changes go into a queue that is visible to users with 10,000 reputation (or more) and moderators. These users can inspect the change and approve it, reject it, or delete the entire post. If approved, the person suggesting the edits gets 2 reputation points. You can earn up to 1,000 reputation points through suggesting edits; of course once you reach 2,000 points you can edit without prior approval. (Note, of course, that all edits are recorded and can be rolled back if necessary.)

When you edit someone else's question or answer, keep these things in mind:

Do


Fix typographical errors
Correct spelling mistakes
Fix broken links
Remove e-mail addresses
Improve formatting
Take out greetings ("Hi!") and sign-offs ("Thanks in advance -- Username") 

although, if this is the only reason you are editing the post, it is probably better to leave it alone



However, and more importantly...

Do NOT


Change the meaning or content of someone's post
Add your own commentary
Delete content
Add information


In other words, your edits should change the readability of the post, not the content. Otherwise, leave a comment.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There were two suggested edits in the queue when I logged in this morning, and both were firmly in the "Do NOT" category.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "Add information" bit might be somewhat disputed when applied to new users, as they have restrictions on e.g. uploading an image, and they have to link to it instead (if at all). But otherwise very reasonable guidelines.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point @Martin, although I did explicitly mention "fix broken links" under "Do". "Linkifying" a raw URL counts for that, in my opinion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think simple typos and mistakes that don't obscure the meaning should be lumped in with greetings and thanks -- don't edit if that's the only reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While true that you shouldn't change the meaning, if it's off-topic you're doing them a favor. If you don't edit it, it will remain off-topic :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If it's off-topic, then it should be closed and/or deleted. There's no point in rescuing something not worth saving.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Only closed if it can be resurrected as on-topic, also deleted if not.  For an example of the former (closed, then edited and reopened): http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6140/is-there-an-ios-gui-skin-theme-for-android


















The https://android.stackexchange.com/faqFAQ doesn't currently discuss shopping.   In the faq question: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/247/faq-what-kind-of-questions-should-i-not-ask-hereFAQ: "What kind of questions should I NOT ask here?" there is an https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/247/faq-what-kind-of-questions-should-i-not-ask-here/249#249answer that says that shopping recommendations are not allowed, but that app recommendations are "on the border".

Are these on topic: I need an app that does XYZ? or I want a widget that does ABC.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions looking for apps on topic?

I like what Al said over https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/246/faq-what-kind-of-questions-should-i-ask-here/252#252here:


  Some completely made up example
  titles:

* How can I stop certain apps from starting automatically? Should I?
* How can I export my contacts to a CSV file?
* How can I get my Calendar app to start the week on a Monday?
* How can I send a single SMS message to multiple recipients?
* How do I root my Android device? Why would I want to?

  
  I guess the key here is if you can't
  phrase it as "How can/do I do X on my
  device (in this app)?" it's suspect.


So basically, don't ask "What's the best music player" (very subjective) but "https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6497/which-apps-do-gapless-music-playbackHow can I play gapless music" instead.  The former is way too subjective and differs on opinion whereas we can actually answer the latter question.

This is very similar to a shopping recommendation and much of the same advice applies.

http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/

Beyond that, consider:


you have created an "infinite list of X" question. Surely there is (probably) an Android equivalent for every single iPhone app?
the equivalents, even if valid now, may change over time; apps change over time. The value of this list will be highly limited as it ages.


Perhaps if you had specific things you were looking for Android equivalents to on iPhone -- like the built in default applications. But scoping it to "any app that can ever be, or will ever be" just doesn't work.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree here. The question, as it stands, is too open-ended. We need specific apps (or, actually, problems to solve). Since *Angry Birds* is on Android, there's nothing the iPhone has that I want that I can't get on my Droid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5& @Al Thanks for you input.  I see what you mean. So should I just delete my post or vote to close it as well (it only needs one more)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dan ok, I closed it. Thanks for asking about this on meta -- that sets you apart from most other users, in a good way!


















The look and feel of http://www.androidpatterns.comAndroid Patterns is another neat site. as for the front page especially and the questions, it would be cool if they were composed along the lines of the the system status window shade:

 

obviously we'd have more horizontal space to work with, but stretched it would fit the stack aesthetic pretty well. The little bumper at the bottom would be a fun trick to play around with if we were going to have a page/comment load transition.

I have the required rep to edit tag wikis (2006 at the time of writing) and it shows as such in my profile, yet whenever I'm editing and adding info to a tag, the banner at the top says - "You do not have tag wiki edit privileges".

Is this intentional behaviour ? Even a user with the approval to edit tag wikis needs to get it approved by others?


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag Wiki Privileges - why does my tag wiki need to be peer approved when I have the same privilege?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good question. Sounds to me like it might be a bug.


















Yesterday I asked a question:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6738/decent-battery-monitoring-appDecent Battery Monitoring App [closed]

It was closed because it's claimed to ask for shopping recommendation. Actually, I'm not asking for a shopping recommendation, but an app recommendation. Now I wonder why this question is not getting closed then?: 

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/495/must-have-applications-for-androidMust have applications for Android? 

If what I asked is a shopping recommendation, then that one is asking even for more. Additionally, we have a [software-rec] tag on SuperUser and we think these kind of questions are quite useful. Note that "Shopping recommendations" are also off-topic on SuperUser.

IMO, there should be a difference (in other words, a line) between "shopping recommendations" and "software/app recommendations". 

For example, this question totally asks for shopping recommendation, but it seems to be allowed here:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6755/what-are-the-least-carrier-crippled-android-phonesWhat are the least carrier-crippled Android phones? 

What are the opinions of Android Enthusiasts on this? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do you decide whether a question asks for shopping recommendation?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you @Mepher, that there's a clear difference. Though it seems on SU that this line is mostly drawn on software vs hardware. Interestingly enough, that would make your question on-topic, and the crippled phone one off-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's worth noting that the "Carrier Crippled phones" question does currently have 3 close votes, so I wouldn't say that's definitely on-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "Must have..." question is a list, yes. But the community feels it's useful and is Community Wiki.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Additionally see http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/164/shopping-recommendations


















We don't want questions phrased as: "What is an app that does A, B, and C?"

We want questions phrased as "How do I do X, Y, and Z?"

The answer to the latter may very well be an app, but then again maybe not. When you ask for an app, you've already got a solution in mind. Answers to that are generally only going to help you. We're more interested in questions that may help many people.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5However, those very same answers may in the future also help other users with the same criteria. Ergo, they would be useful.


















Thank you for your confidence in our abilities! But have you read the https://android.stackexchange.com/faqAndroid Enthusiasts FAQ?

This site is primarily a source to help people use their Android devices, whether it's an issue with hardware, software, a particular app, or even rooting. However, we get some other questions that don't fit here.

Yes, someone here might be able to help you, but you'll find that other forums and sites more focused on your topic can give you a much better answer than a bunch of Android geeks. It's likely that your question will be downvoted, closed, and in some cases marked "offensive." It's not that we hate you, it's just that we are trying to maintain the site's focus for maximum usability.

What forums can people go to to ask the questions that are off topic here? (Please list only one forum per answer so votes can bring the best forums to the top.)

Some potential topics might be:


shopping recommendations
phone hardware comparisons
moderation support
news blogs
and so on

Nothing is listed there because we are in beta.

Once we're out of beta we'll get a set of migration paths based on where we've already sent questions. I'm sure Stack Overflow will be one of them. The vast majority of questions migrated away have been to SO. I only see one each to ui.stackexchange.com and programmers.stackexchange.com.

I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people.

If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question.

That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds.

Looking at the answers, it does seem to be relevant: "Apparently download and recovery modes are merged for the G1."

Al Everett went through the other night and pulled the "t-mobile g1" tag off of most of my posts. In most cases I understand -- ultimately the questions and answers weren't G1 specific (though I didn't know that when I asked them). In this case the answer was so I'm curious about the logic behind pulling the tag. Thanks!

Because it didn't seem device-specific.

My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer.

I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)

I guess my example (your comments) wasn't the best but it was what sparked my question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Daniel - It's cool, it's a valid concern for keeping the community productive.


















It is, basically, a measure of how trustworthy your "flags" are. That is, what priority posts get when you flag them for moderator attention. The higher the number, the greater weight your flags are given.

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/80170/what-is-flag-weightFAQ: What is 'flag weight'?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, Al.  Out of curiosity, is there an upper maximum to this measure?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, 750. But it's an asymptotic value. The closer you get to that value the harder it is to reach. Up to weight 500 it's a linear graph.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very cool, thanks again!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5AFAIK, all this does is help sort our moderator queues.  Those with higher weights are sorted higher in our queue than those with lower weights.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BryanDenny: Yes, that's correct, although if someone's flag weight goes to 0 they'll be blocked from flagging.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @Al, I didn't know about the 0 partb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Bryan: Surprised me too. I don't know if someone can get off of zero and be able to flag ever again.


















Use the flag link.  It brings up a whole slew of options for specifying why you're flagging it.  If you choose "it doesn't belong here" the first option is to mark it as an exact duplicate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually ... it isn't an "exact duplicate," it should just be linked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Amanda - I considered it close enough to flag it as such.  The question that already exists might cover more than the question linked in your original post, but the one you linked would certainly duplicate some of the answers from the existing question.  I think the decision to either link the offending question to the existing one or simply close the offending question is up to the discretion of the mods, in the end.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, thanks. that makes sense. So if I mark it as an "exact duplicate" a mod will decide how to handle it, I won't get knocked for using "exact" inexactly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Amanda - Not being a mod I obviously can't offer the definitive answer on that, but since there's no option for "this is _almost_ an exact duplicate" my answer above is how I presume the system works right now.  It's how I've been treating it and I haven't noticed my flag weight go down.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Flagging" a post just brings it to the moderators' attention. We then get to decide what to do with it (if anything). Once you get enough reputation, you'll get the option to vote on closing posts, including duplicates.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let me just mention: We really appreciate when people bring things to our attention. We can't be everywhere at once.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Everett - How many people are actively flagging posts and comments for you guys?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not many, although the more active "gardeners" have enough reputation points now that we often don't need to get involved.


















Al is correct, the device specific tags are getting a little out of hand but I'm going to have to agree with Amanda and Matthew Read on this one.  I think that it is sufficiently device specific to warrant a device specific tag.  I think it's important to consider that tags are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  I restored the tag but shouldn't it be tagged "htc-g1" instead of "tmobile-g1"?  I thought the practice was "manufacturer-model" not "carrier-model".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which is fine. I'm only human after all. And, yes, the convention on model tags is "manufacturer-model". Carrier, if it's relevant, should be a separate tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, Matt. I'm not sure how I came up with the "tmobile-g1" tag but it was already in use. Presumably because for a lot of folks the manufacturer was obfuscated. I'm off to read up on clearing up tags so I can make some recommendations about getting the "t-mobile-g1" out of the tag prompts altogether.


















Thank you for https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/339/design-ideas-for-android-se-siteyour help on the design brainstorm session. Below are the mockups for the final site theme based on some of the ideas we talked about.

(please click on images to see the full resolution versions)

https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9UHn.png

https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFqXo.png

The design goal is to give this community a distinct look and feel, while still looking like a part of the Stack Exchange network. So I'm not making any layout changes.

The design should also reflect the Android branding. After looking at numerous Android related sites and UI patterns, I've become a big fan of its simplistic and elegant designs.

For the overall look and feel, I want to keep the site airy and clean. The faint honeycomb pattern in the background provides a pleasant noise, but does not get in the way of the content. I also think "Honeycomb" is an appropriate pattern to use because of the Android tablet name.

For the most of the site elements, I went for a "flat" look, polished by hints of translucency. The 3D effects are only reserved for action items such as buttons and widgets.

Of course I'm also using the established green (#A4C639) from the Android branding. 

For the typeface, I'm using http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Droid+Sans&subset=latinDroid Sans.

Please let me know what you think. Assuming there are no major design changes, the site will launch very soon.

Thank you for not over killing it with green. :) I'll take a look at this again in the morning when I'm at a desktop and see if I notice any problems.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Bryan, confession: I used the green for the question titles first. It was just too harsh against the white, even after I darkened it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That looks great, nice work!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have a sample of the 404 page?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al I don't right now. Normally I do 404/captcha/error images last during the CSS conversion. But feel free to make suggestions. I'm thinking using the android robot for those.


















Nice! My only gripe is that the "Recent Badges" puts the badge icons on an awfully dark background -- darker than even the header and footer banner background. That seems off to me, because it makes recent badges (which, I'll grant, are important) look like the most important thing on the page. I wonder if they couldn't be on a lighter background?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see what you mean. Keep in mind though, in the mockup, I simplified everything. So you see all the elements at once glance. In reality, the Recent Badges section gets buried further down the page, it doesn't really compete with the rest of the page. The reason I always use a dark gray or black background color for badges is because the gold/silver/bronze icons would show up well and not clash with the bgcolor.


















Love it, love the badge icons and the Andy's holding the banner up at the top, and the overall fairly clean look, with that bit of fun.

Not totally convinced about the honeycomb background, but also not sure what it could be replaced with.

One suggestion might to do with just making the bar at the top subtly ape the Android notification bar, by removing the background from the top bar, leaving it as a solid colour (or a slight gradient) and left aligning StackExchange logo, while right aligning the search box and icons, username, etc.

Anyway love it overall and don't take this as a criticism.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll try a slight gradient on the bar.


















A lot of folks are using the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tmobile-g1tmobile-g1 tag to refer to the "HTC G1" ... presumably because the phone has no HTC branding on it and the tag exists so it seems reasonable (that's why I used it ...) Seems like both https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tmobile-g1tmobile-g1 and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htc-dreamhtc-dream should be merged under a single tag that follows the "https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/82/more-tag-redundancy-phone-modelsmanufacturer-model" format.  

I don't have the reputation to suggest tag synonyms but this seems worth addressing?


  Users with more than 1250 reputation and a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag, can suggest tag synonyms. Users with a total answer score of 5 or more, can vote for tag synonyms. Suggestions will be automatically approved when they reach a score of 4, and automatically deleted when they reach a score of -2. 


I propose perhaps a community wiki here on meta to tease out all the poorly formed device tags and identify the correct tag they belong under. 

Perhaps along the way we can do more re-tagging of posts with https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260/should-we-discourage-phone-model-tags-in-non-phone-specific-questionsinappropriate device tags so that https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/users/3550/amandanew users don't look around, see a lot of bad behavior and model their own posts after folks who are doing it wrong!

I just went through and retagged everything with "t-mobile-g1" as "htc-g1" because I noticed the "t-mobile-g1" didn't follow the manufacturer-device standard.  Before I saw this question, I might add.  Great minds and all that...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Very nice, @Amanda. I'll make sure we have synonyms set up. One thing that will help is getting tag-wikis for those tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, you can use the "retag-request" tag here in meta to request retags if you don't have the rep to do it yourself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Reminder: Vote for those synonyms! http://android.stackexchange.com/tags/synonymsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5JonnyP and I don't have sufficient reputation to even view proposed synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, that's a bummer. But, considering your level of engagement here, I expect that limitation to be short-lived.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We should probably turn this into a community wiki rather than using the answers as a place to alert mods of errant tags we notice.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5s/we/someone with suitable privileges/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rather than one question for merge requests, I'd rather have separate questions. Like [this](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/98/merge-alarm-and-alarms-tags), [this](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/99/merge-widget-widgets), or [this](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/103/merge-android-market-market). Adding yet another answer runs the risk of being missed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay: can we just close it? I just voted to close it. Alternatively, I can arbitrarily select an answer, which would be a nice thing for JonnyP since I can't select one of my own for two more days.


















A very pleasing selection of colours, however looking at the images, isn't there a bit too much wasted screen real estate on either side?

Also, I hope this is a fluid layout and renders well on most browsers including those on Android devices.

Finally - since we depend on QUESTIONS from users, perhaps the ASK QUESTION could be made more noticeable (either via a change of colouring or font / size)?

Great work, overall.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I agree the ask question link should stand out more AND **it's very important that this renders well on Android devices.**b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can give the Ask Question link a different treatment. The layout is not fluid(as in using 100% of the screen width). It's a fixed width of 980px wish, center aligned. We do have plans for a mobile version down the road for all SE sites.


















I've seen a lot of questions with good solid answers that have been upvoted repeatedly (even questions where the asker has commented on an answer and basically said that it helped them solve their problem) but the asker never officially marks any answer as the one that helped them.  Is there an approved way to let the asker know that they should do this?

Also as a personal curiosity, I was awarded a bounty yesterday but when you look at https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/7133/how-do-i-turn-off-the-cellular-radio-without-disabling-bluetooth/7223#7223the question it doesn't appear to have been marked as having an answer.  Is this the way questions work when there's a bounty attached to them or did the asker simply award me the bounty but fail to mark the answer as correct?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it ever acceptable to prod a user into accepting an answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe the bounty goes to the highest upvoted answer automatically if no answer is selected by the user.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Bryan Denny - Yeah, after seven days it's supposed to award half of the bounty to the highest voted answer.  But the asker gave me the full bounty without marking my answer as correct.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There have been several discussions about this at http://meta.stackoverflow.com. Let me see if I can find some and distill out the consensus.


















https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htc-g1htc-g1 is a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/t-mobile-g1t-mobile-g1 and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htc-dreamhtc-dream
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5HTC Dream seems to be the original name for the device, it's just rebranded as T-Mobile G1. So I'll make htc-dream the main tag, with htc-g1 and tmobile-g1 as synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is complete.


















Consensus seems to be that there's only so much we can and should do for new users. An awful lot of the time they're just "drive-by" askers who will get their answer (perhaps) and be gone, never to contribute to the site. There's no point in spending so much time on them.

For myself, I just try to remind people who find their own answer to post it as such and "accept" it, so that other people with the same issue will see the solution.

I think occasionally reminding users that they should accept the answer that worked for them is okay. If you're seen as a person who does it habitually, however, people may start flagging your comments.

I don't see any posts tagged "HTC Vision" so I don't think we need to add the synonym -- anyone with the device will know it by the names it was marketed under.

There were three questions tagged [galaxy] which I retagged. Two were also tagged with [samsung-galaxy-s] and the third didn't seem to have relevance to the galaxy series at all.

I'm hesitant to suggest that [galaxy] should be a synonym of [samsung-galaxy-s] since there are other galaxy devices (and "galaxy" alone is really quite vague)...but it's one to consider, possibly, since that seems to be what many people mean when they just say "I have a galaxy" (or similar).

So there's nothing to merge here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, "galaxy" should be killed but not merged.  There are a lot of Galaxy 5 questions.


















Hi all,

Thank you for your helpful https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/405/design-mockups-for-final-site-themedesign input. As you can see, the new design went live, this means Android.stackexchange has officially graduated and is no longer a Beta site. Congrats!

If you see any CSS/Styling issues, please start a new question for the bug report, and tag it with "Design" and "Bug." It will be a lot easier for me to track new questions than reading the comments replied to this thread.

Since we're focused on Android, not iDevices, I don't think we need to be as "strict" about being very specific about devices or the distinction between hardware and OS.

I think the only tags we need are https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphoneiphone and maybe https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iosios.

If the type of device is really that important to the question, then it seems to me that the question is probably off-topic.

By the by, some of the questions you're running into were migrated from the defunct gadgets.stackexchange.com. Android and iPhone were both on topic. Not sure if we should bother resurrecting those.

If you're talking about how the row is highlighted, that's because "bug" is a favorite tag of yours and that question uses that tag.

@Jin: Absolutely immense job on the new design. Well done, indeed!

I am of the personal opinion that the ASK QUESTION link, although highlighted in green doesn't really stand out - it tends to merge with the grey background. Could that be changed so as to better display the link? Also, when a user hovers over the link - it tends to fade away.

After thinking about this some more and looking around online I decided to edit my original answer. (Original Post labeled further down below).

If you look at the http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/stockMerriam-Webster Thesaurus entry for "stock" you can see that a few other words for "stock" are "standard", "normal", and "regular".  So to me, "stock-Android" is the Android that comes in the http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.htmlSDK or from http://source.android.com/index.htmlAOSP. Plain and simple.  Its the unaltered version of Android that Google puts out for use (this is on "Pure Google Experience" phones as Lie Ryan said).  That said it would make more sense instead for it to be https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-android-2.2stock-android-2.2 and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-android-2.3stock-android-2.3 or even better https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-froyostock-froyo and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-gingerbreadstock-gingerbread.  That way we know exactly what stock Android the person is talking about. Currently https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android by itself tells us nothing and if you were to search by that tag you would get posts ranging from Android 1.5 - 3.0.  And if we defined it is as "android that comes with your phone", when you searched the tag you would get questions that are totally different and might relate to Sense, Touchwiz or Motoblur.

I think Amanda has a good idea to define a tag for the stock ROM that comes on a device - but I don't think https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android conveys the correct message.  Instead it should be something like "stock-[insert device name]" (this would mean a tag for every device) or something like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-device-romstock-device-rom (so that we could just define one tag and it would indicate that whatever device they are talking about had the stock ROM). Here's actually an example https://android.stackexchange.com/q/7396/2422here on Android Enthusiasts where the question and answer refer to "stock ROM" as being the original device ROM not "stock Android"

In all the time I've been playing with custom Android ROMs, hanging out on XDA and dabbling in development (since before Android 1.1 - I loaded stock Android 1.0 on my HTC Tilt before I even got an Android phone) I've never read "stock Android" referring to the stock Android that came on a device.  Instead ROM builders would refer to it as a "stock HTC Hero ROM" or "stock HTC EVO ROM".  When I was putting Android on my Tilt it was called "stock Android" but thats because thats exactly what it was - plain, default, AOSP Android.

I thought it might help to see some examples of what I mean:

I apologize if I'm beating this to death but I think its pretty clear that our users, other sites, as well as Google itself (see the Engadget link) would consider "stock Android" as the unaltered version of Android that Google puts out for use.

That said, if I am still wrong please let me know and if the Android Enthusiasts community thinks differently then I'm down with whatever we all decide to do. :)

Original Post Below:

I think https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android is a great tag but I'm not sure I agree with the definition.  I may be wrong but AOSP ROMs like CyanogenMod are considered "stock Android" and/or "vanilla Android" but obviously if you have this on your device it does not have the original ROM it shipped with.  

Maybe a tag like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/original-romoriginal-rom (maybe https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-romstock-rom or something similar versus https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/custom-romcustom-rom) would be helpful when asking for help with the ROM that shipped with a device. Although nearly every question would have one of those tags.  The plus side to that though is it would help eliminate one of the first questions we usually ask "Are you using a custom ROM?"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think of "stock" as meaning "the way it came when you bought it" in general, at least as it applies to goods (as opposed to broth or cows).  So any ROM that didn't ship with your phone is by definition not "stock" https://secure.wikimedia.org/wiktionary/en/wiki/stockb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would agree with you on that if the phone had vanilla Android.  If you read further down, under "Adjective", on that link you have there you'll read: "Straightforward, plain, very basic".  In another word, "vanilla".  In my experience most people refer to stock Android as the unaltered one from Google. Since AOSP ROMs are close (if not the same), they tend to be considered "stock Android".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was thinking about it more and I agree with you as well if you were talking about a "stock EVO" or a "stock Droid X".  Talking about a stock device makes me think of how the device came when you bought it (so maybe we need a [tag:stock-device] tag - which may be overkill).  However when you say "stock Android" it doesn't refer to a device so it would seem you are talking about "vanilla Android".  Does anyone else have any thoughts on this or is it just me and Amanda? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Amanda: How about official OTA upgrades? Official upgrades did not come with the device when you buy it, but they are IMO a stock.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lie Ryan, agreed. I actually did include official updates in my definition.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Amanda: oh yeah, sorry about that, I didn't notice them the first time aroundb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Amanda See my comment as well on Lie Ryan's answer.  Maybe I'm taking this view coming from a development side of the fence.  Think if you were to go to an one of Google's Android developers and ask him if my wife's HTC Evo with HTC Sense was stock Android. I highly doubt he would agree with you - I may be wrong though. If you were to say its a stock Evo then yes he would agree - but not to it having stock Andorid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We don't want to have a "stock" tag for every device or even every version of the OS. I'm also starting to think that people are using these existing tags to indicate their device is unmodded. Frankly, I think that should be the default position. Even so, whether it's modded or not seldom has anything to do with the question. People are using tags to describe their device and not the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Al Everett, agreed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Everett Good point (+1) - seeing the tag applied to the device and not Android in general makes sense and I can agree with.  I was looking at it from the view that they were describing Android in general - which is why I didn't think a user with Sense or whatever should call it 'stock'.  And I totally agree with your first sentence in that comment - I was just trying to provide as many options as possible for a solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why the downvote?


















This is a very small issue; in Firefox 4, there is a small but noticeable delay between page layout and the text showing up. This delay does not exist in Firefox 3.

I think a better definition for "stock" is a manufacturer/carrier-blessed ROMs for a particular device, including upgrades. I prefer to define it this way because some people may not realize that they have an upgraded ROM due to automatic OTA upgrades.

And "vanilla" are ROM which attempts to be as close as possible to original AOSP ROMs (e.g. by removing carrier/manufacturer customization and adding none of their own customization). A vanilla ROM may or may not be produced by a third-party. 

In particular, only "Pure Google Experience" phones (e.g. G1, Nexus One, Nexus S), had a ROM that is both stock (comes with the device) and vanilla (no manufacturer/carrier customization).

I wonder if we need these tags at all.

People seem to be mostly using them to describe their devices, not to help categorize the question. That's the wrong use for them. Most of the time when I see tags like this or tags for devices, Android versions, or for a specific mod, the issue they're having has nothing to do with any of that. In fact, it makes things worse, because it will lead people to think that a solution that worked for someone's modded Galaxy S won't work for their unmodded Droid X and they'll ask a duplicate question.

But that's beyond the scope of what we're discussing.

I think "unmodified" should be the default position. I mean, unless someone specifies that they've used a mod, then it should be assumed they haven't.

And, unless it's a problem that has been solved by a mod, there's no need to mention that the device in question is not modified.

I suggest then that all three of the tags in question be removed. If there remain any questions where the unmodified state of the device is germane to the question, then "unmodified" makes a pretty unambiguous tag.

Update: I've looked at a few of the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android and it's clear that we need to keep this tag or some variant. Many of the questions deal with returning a device to its unrooted, unmodified state. Some others are dealing with the standard Android UI (i.e., lacking HTC Sense, Moto BLUR, etc.). One of the latter, at least, I've tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-uistock-ui (and to which I will add a description post haste).

So now I'm back-tracking on trying to eliminate the three tags originally brought up. When the question doesn't have anything to do with whether the phone is "stock" or not, they should still be removed. However, there are questions dealing with returning to "stock" or comparing the differences between "stock" and a mod or "stock" and manufacturer/carrier customizations. Those, I think, still need to have a tag of some sort.

Perhaps questions about returning the device to its state before it came out of the box should be "factory-setting" or "factory-state". That should unambiguously cover returning a phone to its original state.

I didn't dig a lot deeper than "folks are using 'stock' and 'vanilla' interchangeably" -- as Daniel points out "stock" is pretty meaningless on its own. I suspect people are rifling through the available tags to add any that seem to apply. I support ditching it altogether.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree.  I can't even see "unmodified" actually being a good tag; who would look at that category?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: I don't think it's a good tag either, but I was just wondering what to use **if** the fact the device was unmodified was germane to the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Understood.  I think it would be enough to say so in the question in that case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Everett Yeah thats perfect. We don't need these tags - we assume their device is stock unless they say sob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al: I can see a tendency for "factory-setting" or "factory-state" to be misused by people who think that those tags refer to general settings or the out of the box configuration. Returning to the factory state is only relevant to those who have made some kind of modification so how about the tag: "unmod"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt: We do have an "unroot" tag. "Unmod" wouldn't be so bad. It's kind of awkward, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The only reason I'd hesitate on unroot is that users can install custom ROMs without rooting.  unmod is a little weird but it's pithy.


















I have several small-ish questions about the viability of rooting a Nook Color for use as a general purpose tablet. I am considering getting one, and these are technical questions about the root process and operation of the NC that I'd like to find answers for before I make a decision. They are not "should I buy one" questions so I think they definitely fall outside the scope of a shopping recommendation. It's more research than anything else.

Would it be best to post them in one bullet-pointed question, or break them up? They're all pretty narrow in scope, so I'm a little on the fence. I found https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/39223/one-post-with-multiple-questions-or-multiple-poststhis related question on Meta SO, but I'm still not quite sure if it would make sense to have about 5 one- or two-line questions instead of one that's roughly half a page or so.

If you can make them distinct questions that don't really rely on each other, I'd post them separately.  If the questions are naturally follow-ups to each other and may be irrelevant/different/etc. depending on how the other questions are answered, post them together.

If your question is really "How do I root the Nook Color?" or "How can I use the Nook Color as a general-purpose tablet?" and you just have specific concerns about each, I would probably post them together.  I believe Bryan Denny has an NC that he's experimented with, and he could probably provide a good single answer.

My concerns aren't really "How do I root the NC?" because the guides I've found are more than adequate, I believe. It's more along the lines of "How much of the internal memory will I have access to for apps?" and "Is there a desktop recovery/flash utility for the NC if something goes wrong?" They're fairly specific, but also related for the most part.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think those two, at least, should be separate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think I'm inclined to agree. I can group some of them together in a sensible way but break up others, so I'll go with that. Thanks for the input.


















If these tags are worth keeping, then the Windows and Windows XP tags should probably be kept separate.  I know there was at least one question about the Galaxy S drivers for Windows 7 x64, which are different from the 32-bit XP drivers, for example.  The one question tagged Windows XP involves driver issues, which might be specific to XP.  There's another question about having a PC rebroadcast WiFi for a phone, which is Windows 7 specific.  

Edit: I withdraw the below.

Personally, I don't think these tags have any value.  Information about what OS you're using or a problem using a device connected to an OS should be in the question and stay out of the tags.  Most of the time it's incidental information not useful for classification, and the rest of the time it's a classification that I don't think is needed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not totally convinced that desktop OS tags don't have value. I do sometimes come look over the Ubuntu tag for questions I can answer. Questions marked "Windows" (or Windows XP or Windows 7) I'm pretty sure I can't answer. That seems useful to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I kinda agree with Amanda on this - but maybe I'm misunderstanding the real purpose of tags.  However like Al Everett said in [his answer on this page](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/439/desktop-os-tags/440#440) its very possible many of them don't even need the tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK.  If I am wrong about the usefulness of the tags I withdraw that complaint.  I agree that Mac/OSX and Ubuntu/Linux should be merged, at least until we have sufficient reason to separate them.  I think the distinctions I noted are sufficient to keep Windows flavors separate (though not *all* flavors, of course).


















Despite what I just said, on Matthew Read's answer, I'd support merging "Ubuntu" and "Linux" -- if we aren't going to distinguish every single operating system by version (which sounds to me like crazy talk ... every Mac OS? Every Linux distro and release? Eeek.) there's no reason to break out Ubuntu from Linux.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps adding "ubuntu" as a synonym for "linux" could be worthwhile as it is probably the most popular desktop Linux variant.


















(Building on my comment on Matthew Read's answer) Since there does seem to be some use to them I propose having tags: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/windowswindows, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linuxlinux, and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macmac.  That way if a user does have a question like syncing, drivers or whatever that does relate - those that have experience with whichever platform can view have it as a favorite or something.  That said I'm not sure how much we really need them since very few questions should apply to these tags, but if we do then those are the three we should have.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's exactly my thinking, though I'd change the "mac" tag to "mac-osx" that way the tag autocomplete thing should pop it up for anyone typing either name.


















The vast majority of off-topic questions that we've migrated away have been to Stack Overflow. (In fact, I only see two questions migrated to a site other than SO.)

Please add Stack Overflow to the potential list of target sites when voting to close for being off-topic.

Edit: Stack Overflow continues to be, by far, where most of the questions migrated away from here go. It would be really useful to have Stack Overflow as a default migration option.

Edit 2: This trend continues. This would be really useful to have.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please add Stack Overflow as a migration option in the off-topic vote-to-close dialogb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who's capable of making this change, and how do we get their attention?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The devs. And tagging with "feature-request" should be enough. They do monitor all of the child metas.


















I was preparing to ask a question and noticed that the tag prompt on main says 


  at least one tag such as (2.1-eclair samsung-galaxy-s 2.3-gingerbread), max 5 tags


which means we're actively encouraging device and OS tags and is probably be giving new users the impression that the right thing to do is include the a device and OS tag with every post. 

Is there a way to change that?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Revise tag prompt text to encourage fewer device tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good thought.  Better suggested tags are probably something like `messaging`, `wifi`, and `settings`.  (I am excluding `applications` to avoid shopping-request questions).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know how that list is generated. I'm hoping it's by tag popularity. I'll tag this question "support" so that one of the Devs can answer the question.


















That list is generated at website startup by picking from the top 20 tags at random.

If you see things in the list you don't like, that's a strong sign that elements of the site's tagging are broken.

If you need us to press the magic "make it as if this tag never existed" button, just let me know.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not that we don't like them. People just pick them for the wrong reason(s). We will continue to amend as necessary and educate our participants.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think the tagging's broken so much as we have a feedback cycle.  `2.1-eclair` is a useful tag, so there are a lot of questions about it, so new users see it and use it inappropriately, so there are a lot of questions about it, so new users see it and use it inappropriately ... etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it worth adding to the tag wiki some brief guidance on when it's useful to use?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@foley yes, that is *specifically* one of the suggestions at http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/ see #4 in that list


















Hmm. is there a way to complete a merge request without answering it or closing it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure what you mean. I did add the "status-completed" tag to indicate that this was done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, but I got a "tumbleweed" badge for asking a question that not one person tried to answer. So Stack Exchange thinks this was just flapping in the wind, when in fact it was completed.


















The following question was closed without any answer :

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/7755/i-have-to-send-my-new-archos-101-pad-for-repair-screen-wont-display-anyone-anhttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/7755/i-have-to-send-my-new-archos-101-pad-for-repair-screen-wont-display-anyone-an

Does this influence  my accept rate ?

Can I still reach a 100% accept rate now ?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does a closed question count towards the accept rate ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Everett : I 'm just one of those guys that like to tidy up , that's all. And apart from that: sometimes I just wonder about such things. It has helped me a lot over the years just to get to know and understand systems I am using ( any system I am using). Not necessarily because I need it now, but simple because I want to know it ( and think I am going to be able to use that knowledge in the future ).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Accept rate is no longer displayed](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/136951/lets-stop-displaying-a-users-accept-rate/164654#164654).


















I have a few experiences with my phone that I think others might find useful, but I haven't seen questions relating to those particular issues.  Is is considered bad form to ask and answer your own question before any other users interact with the question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it acceptable to ask a question with the express purpose of answering it yourself?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I of course don't know the reasoning behind SE's rule for this, but I agree with the rule because it will attract users to the site.  Someone Googling might see your question, which wouldn't have been here otherwise, and come here instead of continuing their search.  We want to be a fairly comprehensive resource :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matthew Read - That was my thinking as well, but I wanted to make sure it was cool before I went forward.  I'm fairly certain there's some kind of system limits for accepting your own answers as well, which I think is perfectly acceptable (and highly necessary, to be honest).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yep, I believe you can't accept your own answer within 48 hours.


















Noticed that we've got a few tags related to SMS that ought to be merged (I think under SMS because that's the most precise term)

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/smssms https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagingmessaging https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-messagetext-message
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge sms, messaging and text-messageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related note: I think `instant-message` should be renamed to `instant-messaging`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Done. There were just two.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5you can use tag syntax in situations like this: `[tag:sms] [tag:messaging]` etc


















Sounds good to me, especially since it appears users aren't using https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagingmessaging to refer to email or anything else but SMS.

I have proposed the other two as synonyms for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/smssms (https://android.stackexchange.com/tags/sms/synonymslink).

On the other hand, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/instant-messageinstant-message is proposed as a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagingmessaging, which I disagree with since again, users have only used https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/messagingmessaging for SMS.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Instant message more accurately refers to IM clients, like AIM and Google Talk. "Messaging" could refer to IM and/or SMS.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. It looked like all the "messaging" questions were SMS related. The two instant-messaging questions are about AIM/Jabber clients.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since "messaging" could count for either or both, it probably should go away. Trouble is people will probably still use it, so it needs to be a synonym or have a rock-solid definition.


















Given Jeff's answer & response to my comment, and the fact that I can't see that any of our tag wikis currently http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/"Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag" (though they do define what the tag means), I'd suggest we start with this.

The Device/OS tags are a great example - can we first define when it is appropriate/useful to apply these tags, add some guidance to the tag wikis and see if that makes any difference?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, the WIFI tag has decent usage guidance: http://android.stackexchange.com/tags/wifi/infob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point. I've been writing a lot of the tag wikis and I actually contemplated sticking a standard line on the device and OS pages. I'll start a separate discussion for that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, good idea. Even if it doesn't change usage, it will at least help us decide if we have a problem / how big it is if we can define what correct usage is in the first place!


















This is our current generalist query: 

select * from
(
    select UserId as Id
    from 
    (
        select UserId from UserTagTotals
            where TotalAnswerScore >= 15
            and TagId in (
                select top 40 Id from Tags
                where [Count] > 200
                order by [Count] desc
                )
            and (select COUNT(*) from Tags where [Count] > 200) >= 40
    ) as X
    group by UserId
    having COUNT(UserId) >= 20
) as generalist


In particular we make sure: 


Only tags that have more than 200 questions are considered
Your score is more than 15 on 20 of the top 40 tags




At the moment no one in the android site can get the generalist badge due to (1) ... over time as the site gains traction, the badge will pop up. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, thanks for letting me know!


















Maybe something like "Only add a device or OS tag if your question is truly about your make and model, not just related!" would be even clearer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds about right. I'll make the change since no one else seems to have weighed in.


















Fairly self-explanatory, I think.  I had the https://android.stackexchange.com/badges/57/suffrage?userid=3522Suffrage badge from long ago and yesterday I used all 30 of my daily votes, but I don't see a x2 next to the badge on my user page.

Just curious.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can a user receive the Suffrage badge more than once?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Using up 30 votes is a very easy way to get a badge, which is great for encouraging new users to vote; but if you're allowed to receive it multiple times it devalues the badge system. Hence it's a one time badge.


















I've been looking at a lot of the device tags, and creating wikis for many of them. I tend to point to Wikipedia for phone specs because it's pretty comprehensive. The https://android.stackexchange.com/tags/htc-desire/infoHTC Desire page was somewhat confusing and I was curious about whether there are any synonyms floating around, so I https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTC_Desirelooked it up on Wikipedia. 

The text is pretty much a direct quote. Our tag wiki excerpt:


  The HTC Desire (codenamed Bravo) is a
  smartphone developed by the HTC
  Corporation, announced on 16 February
  2010 and released in Europe and
  Australia in the second quarter of the
  same year. The HTC Desire currently
  runs the Android operating system,
  version 2.2 "Froyo, although it
  shipped with v2.1 (Eclair).
  
  Android, version 2.3 "Gingerbread"
  update expected in May or June 2011.
  Internally it bears a strong
  resemblance to the Nexus One, but
  differs in some features.


and the device's wikipedia page:

It seems to me that the Wikipedia community is doing a pretty good job about maintaining comprehensive specs on Android devices and has higher standards for citing sources, etc, and we ought to just point to them rather than lifting a snapshot of Wikipedia's content without any commitment to maintaining our parallel page. At a minimum, though, plagiarizing Wikipedia is still plagiarism and a violation of the attribution terms of their license.

In sum, we should link to the Wikipedia page and the CC-BY-SA licence. I am assuming that SE's licencing is sufficient for the copyleft requirement.

As for whether we should use Wikipedia, I think it's a great starting point if the wiki article is good.  If users want to improve upon that, great! If not, it's much better than nothing.  I wouldn't say they're doing a good job of providing accurate information, though.  Most of it usually comes from some enthusiast when the device is announced and/or released, with errors and outdated information living on.

If we're not adding anything and the community here isn't actively maintaining those pages (and we aren't), we've just saddled ourselves with a one time snapshot of a living page off on Wikipedia. Better to point people to the living page than capture a snapshot ourselves that will just grow stale here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just linking to Wikipedia is the equivalent of saying "Just Google it." It's basically pointless, and we want to be attracting users not sending them away. If users aren't updating the tag wikis, then we should work to encourage them to do so.  And even when we copy info from Wikipedia, we'll still have the link to the article due to the attribution requirements.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm suggesting finding the Wikipedia entry for that device and linking to the page itself, not just linking to the Wikipedia home page!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know.  My point is that they should be able to click on the tag and find information, not be told to go elsewhere.

I realize (now) that the site design was a community process, and this feedback may not be desired or appropriate, but, well, here it is.  Vote to close if and as necessary...

I find myself not participating in Android Enthusiasts simply because of the new theme.  It's been a couple of weeks now and instead of going away my feeling are intensifying.  I almost don't know how to put what I don't like about the design into words, but I realize I have to at least try.  The whole design is too...light?  Bright?  Monotonous/monolithic?  All of which combines to create an almost literal blur.  The beta design had non-subtle (but still non-obtrusive) color, the questions were easily distinguishable, questions with tags I like were well-highlighted.  Different elements had texture or edges or were otherwise easily distinguishable from the background.  The new theme is just too...subtle?  All-encompassing?  Overwhelming?

I open the site each day (via the Firefox Morning Coffee extension), and have participated daily since I joined 6 months ago.  The last two weeks...more often than not, I simply close the window.  I hope I'm the only one feeling this, but in case I'm not, I felt I should post it.

I know how much work a cohesive site design involves, and I in no way wish to denigrate the work that went into this site design.  Tastes and styles are highly subjective things, and I don't expect to be liking everything I see on this great net of ours.  The result of this design though is almost physically pushing me away and I just wanted to give feedback in case others were feeling anything similar.

Thanks for listening!

Check out the comments on http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/417/new-design-launchedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sorry you don't like the new design. You are, of course, entitled to your opinion. It really keeps you from participating? Anyway, there are a number of ways you can impose your own style sheets on the site. You could probably revert it back to the beta look-and-feel if you wanted to. Or just make it less "bright".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's what I plan on doing, Al...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not the entire design, but certain parts could do with some contrast work to make them stand out. Also, a wider, fluid layout would ensure monitors with multiple resolution widths can comfortably see the site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the feedback! By all means, please specify in detail which elements you think need to be improved. I normally fix usability issues right away. However, please keep in mind that I rarely make changes based on subjective personal preferences.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I find the buttons and badges hard to read. I think it's a combination of low-constrast grays, plus detail -- gradients, shading, circles and cirlces. SO-mothership has simple triangles. Obvious and readable!


















I do know that if you vote on a post, then immediately retract your vote, you won't later be able to vote on it. This is apparently by design.

I expect this is the same situation, although you didn't retract your vote voluntarily, but were forced to by the vote limit.

You won't be able to vote on it until it's edited.

We're evaluating the feasibility of sponsoring a member of the Android community to speak at a conference in 2011.

Speaking is a relatively big "ask", so this needs to be planned many months in advance. Let's get started! 

We'd like the community to establish where ...


  What relevant Android conferences are coming up in 2011 that have open speaker slots or calls for papers?


... and then who.


  Which members of the community are strongly interested in being sponsored by Stack Exchange, Inc to speak at one of the above conferences in 2011?


To be clear, the speaker is free talk about anything he or she wants so long as it would be roughly on topic for this site -- with a quick acknowledgement of support from Stack Exchange and a mention of the community here.

It could just be me, but one thing that's happened since the new design has been launched is that, more than once I've typed out an answer to a question, and then once I've read through it to double-check there's no glaring errors, I go to post the answer, but stop because the button is disabled. I then go through a bit of a rigmarole of searching round the page to see if I've missed ticking any boxes, adding any tags, etc, then copying all the text to clipboard/notepad and then reloading the page to make sure the question hasn't been deleted/closed/migrated, then finally try clicking the button to see what the error message will be - only for everything to post correctly with no problem.

I think this is because, to me at least, the "Post Your Answer"/"Post Your Question" buttons look exactly like disabled "greyed-out" buttons in Windows (and in many web apps), to the extent that I seem to be mentally conditioned to not even consider clicking them until I've looked all round the form to see what I've missed.

 

As an example from a popular web app many of us will be familiar with, here an enabled and disabled button in Gmail, notice which one the Post button on here looks like:



Is there a way that the various post buttons can be made to look a bit more "active" perhaps a bit of colour, or something along those lines?

(Firefox 4 on Win7 & Vista, in case it matters)

The "Ask a Question" page currently has the following notice on the right side near the question box:


  How to Ask
  
  Is your question about Android?
  
  We prefer questions that can be
  answered, not just discussed.
  
  Provide details. Share your research.
  
  If your question is about this
  website, ask it on meta instead.
  
  read the faq »


Being that there's a seemingly nontrivial number of development questions asked here which are summarily migrated, I think it would be helpful to have another heading in the dialog. My thought is that it would go below the current one, but above the read the faq >> link, and would say something like the following:


  Is your question about developing Android apps?
  
  If so, please ask it on http://stackoverflow.comStackoverflow,
  and add the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/androidandroid tag.


I don't know if this would help, but it would make the off-topic nature of dev questions a bit more visible. Currently we rely on the fact that people will read the FAQ, which (from what I've seen), new users often don't do. Other than the FAQ, there's no real indication that AE is for users rather than development. "Enthusiasts and power users" is how the site is described in the banner, but I see both of them as being a little fuzzy.

Thoughts? Comments? Witty sayings?

Edit: Any other feedback on this? I still think this is a good idea (shameless bump in a way, but I guess you can't set bounties on child Meta sites). I know this won't solve the problem completely but the extra exposure seems like it couldn't hurt.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Add a note to the "Ask a Question Page" to reinforce that dev questions are off-topicb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, all the people who voted it up think this is a good idea. It'd be up to the devs to say "yea" or "nay". I think they'd be more interested in features that would be applicable for the entire network of sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The number of development questions still hasn't slowed down. Devs, please re-visit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do other non-stackoverflow Stackexchange sites handle this problem? Some should face the same problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Bump bump bump bump bump


















You make a good point. I have updated the button styling a bit, both on the main site and on Meta. For the main site, I made the button text green, and for Meta they're much darker now. 

The changes will be in the next deployment.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, Jin, that should save my confusion!


















StackOverflow is for programmers' question only, but developing not only programming.

I think developing should be change to programming.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would opine that they're close enough to be interchangeable in this scenario. The FAQ currently uses both phrasings: `Android - Stack Exchange is not for programming questions. Please ask your developer questions on StackOverflow.` I'd think that "developing" is pretty clear, but I'll admit that I'm generally indifferent.


















I think your monitor's gamma is a bit off. But I do realize a lot of people have this problem, especially on older LCDs. I have bumped up the alpha to 0.6 if it helps. The change will be in the next deployment. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Absolutely agree its an issue with my monitor(s). But as you say it's a common issue and unavoidable for me (dual screening two very different monitors). Thanks for the adjustment.


















I've been seeing a lot of questions lately asking for apps that do x or y, and so I read the main site's FAQ again and noticed that it's not explicitly stated that asking for app recommendations is off-topic.

Was this changed recently?  Was it ever officially a rule?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are app recommendations still considered off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For what it's worth, the [FAQ] was updated since this question was asked and initially answered. It explicitly mentions app recommendations as questions that ***should not be asked here***.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Such questions are on-topic at Software Recommendations: http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com


















I believe the standing rule is to not ask: "What is the best application that does X?" 

Instead you should ask "How can I do X?"

In other words, it needs to be a solvable problem.  App recommendations (what is the best app) are very subjective and there is no definite answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, so the next natural question for me is, as a mod, would you suggest we flag questions as off-topic or add a comment telling the asker to rephrase their question (or perhaps just edit the question ourselves)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Any or all of the above would be sufficient. Either flag it and one of us will take care of it or leave a comment to get the author to improve the question if it is salvageable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That said, if the request is for an app with some _very_ specific requirements such that there will probably only ever be one or two answers then it could probably stand.


















This is better explained over at https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-postsmeta.stackoverflow.com.

In short, community wikis are discouraged because they encourage "subjective" and "open-ended" questions.  But sometimes they do make sense.  For example, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-devicewe have a CW on rooting phones. I believe they removed the option for users to make their own posts into a CW.  Instead, only moderators can make a post CW. 9 times out of 10, a question that "should be CW" probably should be closed due to being subjective or not a real question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, so I understand this... certain posts or types of posts get turned into CWs if they have enough content (e.g. the rooting phones you mention). So where is the link to find these posts? Is it just the tag and they're really nothing more than a regular question with a tag that everyone has agreed to respect as special?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Eric the key difference between a normal question a CW question is that you do not gain any rep from a CW question or answer. This meta answer tells how to search for CW questions: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/38823/is-there-a-way-to-search-for-community-wiki-questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That helps a lot. The short answer is, I can put 'wiki:1' in the search box or there's an URL I can use. Seems a strange way to operate, but at least I know now. Thank you for the pointers.


















Sorry that this is not a question, and perhaps being posted in the wrong area.

I was thinking that it would be great if instead of a questions column we could have a tips n tricks column where we could post things we find on ways to do things on the Android. 

This could alleviate some of the questions asked if someone else has already posted a better or different method of doing the thing they are having an issue with.

Then as we discover great features we can hop on and post about them so everyone can benefit. Would also change the feel of the site as only having problems posted makes it look like Androids are nothing but trouble!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would a tips and tricks section be welcome on the site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This web site is specifically a questions and answers site. Please see this question for some places that do carry Android related tips and tricks http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4060/blogs-for-android-apps-and-tipsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can make a question out of the tips and tricks you want to talk about, and answer it yourself (Jeopardy-style question is specifically allowed in StackExchange). I've done several such questions in the past.


















Your question is a bit "rant-y". I'm sure I understand your frustration; too often these damn carriers ruin what is otherwise an elegant phone OS.

If your question is really "how can I submit an official bug report with Sprint?" then please edit your question to make that clearer (and remove the ranty bits). Knowing how to get past mainline tech support to really report a bug is something other hardcore Android users would want to know. (In fact, a Community Wiki question with answers for each of the carriers would be even more useful.)

If that's not really your question, then please make it clearer what your question actually is. And in either case leave out the rant. (As it says right in the FAQ under "What should I not ask here" is: "it is a rant disguised as a question".)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5first thank you.  Second, if I did not include the bit about interactions with Sprint, everyone will suggest tech support. I was pointing out that normal tech support isn't going to help in this case.  I will endeavor to edit some more for clarity after workb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Edit" is a remarkably powerful tool....


















It looks like the earliest questions tagged are about India and Indian phone/network specific issues (regardless of whether they've been closed). In this case the tags do help scope down answers and answerers.

The two questions tagged India this week had nothing country specific in them, and could apply equally to anyone in any country. I've removed the "India" tag from those questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I think this is the rare case where such a tag could be useful.  Indian phone networks are weird.  That said, at least one of the two remaining open questions is not India-specific and the other is a shopping rec.  So currently the tag has no real use...


















We don't have any other country-specific tags. I don't think this one is necessary.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, it shouldn't be necessary


















In much the same way we can star questions that we want to keep track of is there a way (or can one be implemented) that allows us to star other users?

I imagine it being used in cases where one person really goes above and beyond in answering a question and the asker wants to mark the answerer (real word?) for easy recognition later.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a way to "star" individual users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4064/is-there-any-way-to-mark-a-user-as-favorite and http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/886/a-friends-list-on-stack-overflow-would-be-niceb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm really flattered.


















I think the idea of StackExchange sites is that you should be voting on the answer of its own merits, not on the merits of who posted it.

Easily following a user would more open up the system for "gaming" where people follow their friend|enemies and upvote|downvote.

This is possible by going into a user's profile and looking at their questions and answers, but it isn't quite as exposed.

But people do come with baggage -- we are more inclined to view the answer from a person with 12.6K rep as more authoritative than from somebody with 126 rep. Even though the latter might have given a better answer. But the goal is to vote answers for their own merits.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was looking at it more as a means of augmenting the rep system ("This user is trusted by ## other users.") than as a way to bypass the core goal of the system, but you're totally right that people would probably abuse it both intentionally and unintentionally.


















To add to what Michael P. said: if you're really interested in a particular user's activity you can always subscribe to his/her user rss feed. The link is found on the user profile page, in the lower right corner.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd never noticed that feature.  Good stuff, but functionally different from the goal I originally had in mind.

Are purchasing recommendations allowable?
Here's an example:
Joe wants a new Android 3 tablet. He asks a question that says:

I'm in the market for a new Android 3 tablet. I want one with a 1GHz processor, a Gorilla Glass screen, a camera on the front, and it should have internal GPS.

Covered here

http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/

but the TL;DR version is:


  Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish and he can eat forever.


That is, teach people how to evaluate android hardware -- don't spoon feed them specific recommendations that will be obsolete in 12 months.

It looks like, apart from one migrated question, that https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/websitewebsite is being used to refer to the Android Market website.  It should be renamed to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/market-websitemarket-website or something if we want to keep it.  We could possibly just edit them to use the existing https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/marketmarket tag instead.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/websiteswebsites has two about the browser (those should probably be retagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/browserbrowser), one actually about websites, and one about viewing web pages offline.  The https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htmlhtml tag is similarly all over the place, I'm not sure how we should sort that out.

Google just rolled out it's +1 feature across the web, and it got me thinking that using it on SE sites could be a great way to further promote great questions since the more a site or page gets +1 clicks the higher it appears in Google's search results.

Good idea?  Bad idea?  Redundant idea?

Discuss.

I'll never use +1, just like I never use StumbleUpon or the Facebook "likes".  That said, other people will.  I see no reason not too, really.  Even if it dies in the future, it's probably not much work to integrate it (the SE people or Al can correct me on this if I'm wrong).

This is a bit borderline, but it is extremely specific --

I searched for such an app and could not find one

The specific-ness makes it allowable IMO. I don't think any of the /faq section you quoted is applicable in this case. The first line tells:


  You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face.


This is practical, answerable, and is based on the user's specific needs without being absurdly specific.

I'm cleaning up the thirty-odd questions with the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-versionandroid-version tag. I can't see what the tag is really used for. Primarily, lately, it just looks to be what people choose because https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/androidandroid is blacklisted.

Can anybody come up with a good use for this tag? There's certainly nothing in the tag wiki for it.

Update: Okay, these are all cleaned up now. For the most part I replaced it with an actual version tag or, more often, simply removed it since it was superfluous. In some cases it was replaced with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-versionsandroid-versions, for which I need to write a tag-wiki.

It should be replaced with the actual android version in regards to the question, right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In most cases, yes.


















The first three questions kind of use it sensibly:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4447/what-percentage-of-users-use-each-of-the-android-versionsWhat percentage of devices have each of the Android versions?


Those are clearly questions about different versions of Android in a general sense.

That said, I don't think the tag is useful, and it's certainly been abused.  It doesn't create a useful category; I don't think filtering for these questions would be a common behavior.

Consider the following tags:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/upgradeupgrade
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/updateupdate
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/updatesupdates


They all appear to be questions about moving from one version of Android to a newer version.

Which should be the master tag?

Related, what about questions about upgrading applications. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/app-upgradesapp-upgrades perhaps? Do we need https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/os-updateos-update?

(https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/upgradesupgrades has no questions at the moment, but I'd expect it to be a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/upgradeupgrade or vice versa.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5update(s) vs. upgrade(s)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure I'd bother distinguishing between various types of updates.  If we want to reserve `updates` for OS updates only, I'd be inclined to just remove the tag entirely from app-update questions.


















I'm inclined to go with [update] as the master tag. "Upgrade", to me, implies a voluntary purchase of a newer version. "Update" is what you do when your carrier/manufacturer releases a newer version; you don't get much choice in the matter. There are also those occasional updates that remove functionality, which is not an upgrade.

Besides, [update] currently has, by far, the most questions.

(Obviously rooters/modders are different, but they're a minority of Android users.)

Those are usually called downgrade, not downdate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lie: Fair point, and [tag:downgrade] seems like a reasonable tag to have.


















I would like to discuss this "Possible Duplicate" closure.

My question: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/10959/how-to-force-load-desktop-version-of-websiteHow to force load desktop version of website?

The "original" question: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6233/how-can-i-change-the-user-agent-for-the-stock-browserHow can I change the user agent for the stock browser?

My objections are:


How to change the user agent and how to load the desktop version of a site are two different questions.
Changing the user agent is valid but maybe not the only answer to my question.
Because I didn't know that changing user agent can force load the desktop version I wasn't able to find the answer. More and more people will have the same problem and there will be more and more duplicates like mine.


What do you think?

Thanks.

The closed questions act as a "gateway" for alternative search terms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for re-opening, the standard mechanism is for 5 people with sufficient reputation points to vote to re-open. As a Mod I can do it myself, but there _were_ three other people who also voted to close before I acted. If I re-open it may end up being closed again anyway. I'd like to hear from a few more users about this before acting unilaterally.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The search "gateway" makes sense. There is still the question whether the "original" question (changing user agent) is the only answer to my question.


















Other than "Find somewhere on the webpage with a 'main site' link and click it," there's really no other answer to your question.  There are site-specific methods, such as appending &m2w to a Facebook URI, but those would be impossible to all list in an answer.

Sites that care about the user agent may load a movile version; sites that don't care show the same site to everyone.  It's really the only reliable way to determine if someone is using a mobile or not.

I did consider this issue before voting to close, but in addition to above I agree with Al's reasoning: People searching for either version will find the answers, since your question is now linked to mine.  If a question came up about using Firefox or another browser to do this, that would not be a dupe since it's excluded from my question.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you, especially after the search "gateway" explanation. Unfortunately there is a negative emotion associated to the act of closing your question, as if I didn't my homework and didn't check the other questions first, as if did something wrong. Event the sticker says "...covers exactly the same ground...". Maybe it would be worth rethinking the message.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@daniel.sedlacek That's probably a fair point. I should remember to leave an explanatory comment for my vote, as well.


















Could you create [meta-smartphones] as a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-phoneandroid-phone, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cellphonescellphones or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/phonephone...

Why make a synonym of a blacklisted tag instead of just blacklisting it? Or am I not grokking what you're saying?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Everett, I guess I was saying that if the tag is semi correct (a phone) because technically you might have an Android phone question then why not have many of the 'phone derivatives' as synonyms which takes care of them not being shown and automatically correcting them when used...


















Yeah, that's vague and a meta-tag. I'll see if I can clean up some of those.

Update: Okay, I've cleaned the 5 that just had "information". Most of them were changed to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/system-infosystem-info so that's probably a good synonym.

You need to click the 'mobile' link in the page footer now.


















This question is directly related to my answer to a question on the main site: https://android.stackexchange.com/q/11593/981Mobile to PC skype video chat?

The timeline for the sake of relevancy: The questioner was looking for a way to make a Skype video call from his phone (EVO, not supported by Skype's video feature) to a computer. I saw a thread on XDA which was discussing the idea with the rather vague title of "Skype with Video", and I left a comment containing a link to that thread. As it turns out, there is a Skype .apk in that XDA thread which has been modified to allow video calls on unsupported phones. The link to said .apk has been subsequently https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/11596/2edited into my answer.

My concern: In the United States, the modified .apk is almost certainly a copyright violation under DMCA law. It may also fall under international laws, but I'm not really sure (I also will not comment on other countries as I am not familiar enough with their laws). Being that both Skype and Stack Exchange are based in the US, I'm not sure that international law would really fall into play anyhow.

The edit which includes the link was added, then rolled back (by Al Everett), then added again. Since there seems to be something of a gray area here, I wanted to explicitly pose this question: Where do we stand on modified .apk files? For that matter, does anyone know where the law stands on these files? Patching the file presumably required decompilation of the .apk, which is why I believe it would constitute a copyright violation in countries with DMCA-like laws.

This is no place for edit wars.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is a good question for the devs, they may already have formed a position on this sort of thing. I know it's OK to use copyrighted images and such, they feel it falls under fair use.  As far as legality of the APK - it actually doesn't matter that it was modified for determining whether it's illegal. They're distributing it illegally, and downloading it would be illegal, at least in most countries I know of. @Al Your edit would have benefitted greatly from a comment. I don't think the edit significantly changes the answer. It doesn't remove content, just incorporates the comments+details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matthew: You're right that redistribution in general is probably infringing, but modification could be important in other circumstances (i.e. the .apk is freely redistributed outside the Market but only in compiled form). In this particular instance I agree that the modification is more than likely irrelevant, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry about the edit wars. @Matthew was right, i was just trying to incorporate the answer from the comments to the answer. Understood about the direct link to the apk though, and good call on eldarerathis's part. He has re-edited the answer to exclude the direct link. i didn't even think about it at the time, but this is a good point. The first link was to a public version of skype that was enabled to work on other phones, which i would assume to be okay, but i agree that .apk's that infringe on rights shouldn't be posted directly. Sorry about that, it won't happen again. Thanks guys!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related question: Getting movies from the Android Market requires a non-rooted phone. So shipping phones without root access by default is essentially a DRM mechanism. Thus, rooting one's phone is circumventing DRM, which is illegal in the US. Do we now have to remove all our questions on and related to rooting? I think that would be ridiculous.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matthew: That's kind of a fine line, I think. Rooting (and jailbreaking for iPhones) is exempted from the DMCA in the US now, so the act of rooting in and of itself does not constitute infringement. I'd argue that it doesn't "break" the DRM on the Market videos either since you are simply blocked at that point. Circumventing *that block*, though, would probably be a DMCA violation (IANAL, though). I guess the question would be whether there is a convincing argument that non-root default access is itself DRM for things like the movies.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis I'm sure a lawyer could make a convincing argument and a tech-averse judge would agree with it :P. And certainly one could unroot, download the movie, and reroot ...

Is there a point where the thread is no longer okay to link to, and is that a line we should try to draw? I have to admit, I did not read the entire thread on XDA before I linked to it in my comment, so I wasn't actually aware that the offending .apk was there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@elderathis: talking about illegal activity happening somewhere else is not itself illegal. IANAL, but I would assume it would be (or should be) protected by free speech. However, if the developers never intended an application to be available in certain country, we should not be condoning such activities in good faith.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5file may be legal in some places, illegal in others.

r/android on reddit has a strong http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ioqcb/randroid_piracy_policy/no-piracy rule, we should follow the same.

We shouldcan only create tags when there are posts to put them against.

For one thing, no one may actually ask a question about that device.

For another, the Stack Exchange software removes tags that don't have any questions associated with them after some number of days. (Four, I think.) So even if we didcould set up tags ahead of time it's likely they'd get deleted before someone used them.

I'm Sam. I work at Stack Exchange HQ in NYC. As you may have noticed, I've been refining some titles to turn them into questions and better reflect the query posed. Don't hesitate to let me know if you've got an issue with any of my edits.

Thanks,

The beta is over, and Android.SE is a full-fledged member of The Stack Exchange network. By rights, you should be electing moderators, but instead the site is still moderated by http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/Moderators Pro Tempore. This is... somewhat unfortunate. We'd really like to hold elections, but... There aren't quite enough users with high reputation to pull it off just yet. We'll talk more about this later...

Fortunately, we do have some very dedicated users who've volunteered their time to do https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/161/moderator-pro-tem-announcementthe pro tem thing until we've ironed out the election thing. So I am pleased to announce that a new member has stepped up and generously volunteered his time to help us assure that this community’s issues are properly addressed:

Moderators, serious Stackers and casual users,

Within the coming weeks, we here at Stack Central will be putting a little bit of effort into promoting the Android site. We're hoping to get you involved.

Please chime in with any ideas -- from traditional (banner ads, giveaways, forum outreach, etc.) to off-the-wall (Can we get an ape to take a self-portrait with the new HTC?). 

What do you think will help grow Android.SE into a bigger and better site?

All input is welcome. 

We look forward to hearing from you!

Gaming has gotten great traffic via asking users who get a new game to post as many questions as they can.  This provides the benefits of seeding (more questions) without the drawbacks (crappy, contrived questions) since the questions are intended to be about actual problems the gamers encounter.  It's simply prompting them to ask the question on Gaming rather than trying to solve the problem on their own.  Having so many questions about the game on the day of release and thereafter means that Gaming gets a huge chunk of the search traffic for the game.

We could try a similar thing when Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is released.  Everyone with a flagship device could upgrade immediately and start asking questions, as could anyone who gets a new device with the OS.  Probably it won't work as well as on Gaming, but it's sure to be better than nothing.

That post seems redundant to me.  All the questions it links to are tagged /questions/tagged/on-topic-definitionon-topic-definition so it seems that the https://webapps.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/on-topic-definitiontag page would already be useful for collecting them together.

The other problem I see is with people reading it.  It will get buried with time like all Meta posts, and the FAQ is more likely to be seen.

It certainly couldn't hurt, of course, I'm just not sure it's worth the (admittedly minor) bother.

Yes, your reputation decreases when you downvote an answer, but only by a small amount. Downvotes on questions, however, have no cost associated with them (though https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/90324/should-downvotes-on-questions-be-free/90927#90927they did previously). Click on the arrow beside the https://android.stackexchange.com/faq#reputationWhat is reputation? topic in the site's FAQ for details on which actions give (and take away) reputation.

This is done to make people think seriously about downvoting anything.

Any positive action you do will get you at least five times as many reputation as you lost on that downvote, so it's really not worth worrying about too much.

See this StackExchange blog post http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/the-value-of-downvoting-or-how-hacker-news-gets-it-wrong/The Value of Downvoting, or, How Hacker News Gets It Wrong for more info on why, especially this section:


  The net effect is that you have to feel very strongly about
  something to downvote it. Downvotes are serious business, and not to
  be cast lightly. We designed our system around that maxim.


In circumstances where an answer is totally unrelated, or is spam, or really shouldn't be there for any reason you can click the "Flag" link to let a moderator know what you think. If a moderator agrees with you and deletes the post, then you may get your rep points refunded. More on flagging here http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/Improved Flagging, including the side-effects of over-using the Flag option.

You can read the original discussion about why this distinction was made here: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/90324/should-downvotes-on-questions-be-free/90927#90927.


















I touched on this before, briefly, in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/559/3812Matt's Moderator Pro Tempore announcement...

This is a great site, but it's... got no middle class. There are only a tiny handful of users with more than 2K reputation points on the site! That's bad news for a healthy community: most of the tools for editing, closing, review are out of reach for most folk.

You have a few high-rep users, and some moderators, and a huge mass of low-rep users... But there's no middle class, no healthy population of shopkeepers minding their tags. 

Obviously, y'all need to be voting - early and often. But I don't think that's the only or even the best solution... At some point, we need to get more users coming back regularly, feeding back into the site. 

I see https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/562/site-promotion-ideasSam has a "promotional" thread going here - that's a good start. If you haven't already chimed in there, please do so! Anything we can do to help you guys reach more people is a good start...

But beyond that, as an active user of the site, what have you observed standing in the way of users reaching that middle rung?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You need the bourgeois bluesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's been a few months, @Shog9.

Which isn't to say you're out of the woods by any means... I'm afraid some of this is simply the nature of the topic - I've recently started playing around with an Android device, and while this site *has* been helpful, the experience has also hammered home just how fragmented both the platform and the documentation are - getting this place to the point where it can be a "one stop shop" is no easy task...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, that's kind of been my feeling as well.  Thanks.


















I think part of it is the type of user we attract, for whatever reason.  Most people seem to come looking for a quick fix to a problem and then leave.  Like I've said before, I've seen the same problem on XDA.  Lots of users who take a little and give nothing.

I do wonder if that's just how users break down across the Android platform itself -- hardcore early adopters, and then a bunch of people for whom it's just a phone.  Not a ton of power users who aren't experts.  If that's the case, it will take extra effort to bring in a disproportionate number of those users until the platform matures and we get those users naturally.

I've also seen several users get excited for a week or so, answering a bunch of questions ... and then leaving, before really reaching the middle-class you speak of.  I'm pretty confused as to why that happens.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder, does super user experience this problem?  A mass exodus of "one time askers" and a smaller margin of people who are willing to help them?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good question. It does have [a low number of active users](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/power-laws/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"*I've also seen several users get excited for a week or so, answering a bunch of questions ... and then leaving, before really reaching the middle-class you speak of. I'm pretty confused as to why that happens.*" -- I've witnessed this behavior for flashing ROM or kernel/filesystem related questions. The answers to them are hard to verify or test, so I think the voters generally would tend to ignore such complicated answer, and since they can't really verify the usefulness, hence no voting, and the encouragement of the user loses after a week or so.


















I guess I fall into the "middle class" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you:


A lot of people legitimately don't know what this site is for. We get development questions regularly, and some users have even seemed https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/12225/kernel-programming-on-androidcompletely perplexed when their questions were summarily closed. This makes me wonder if there are "power users" out there who aren't using Android Enthusiasts because they think it's for Android devs.
We get a lot of duplicate questions masquerading as legitimate ones. Everyone operates under the assumption that their particular phone model is a special snowflake, so there are repeat questions with the only difference being the device(s) involved. This gets out of hand pretty quick and people lose interest in answering them. As an example, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/43/how-do-i-share-my-wifi-with-my-ipod-or-netbookthere https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1005/activating-wifi-hotspot-tethering-on-a-verizon-droid-with-froyo-2-2are https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1005/activating-wifi-hotspot-tethering-on-a-verizon-droid-with-froyo-2-2quite https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6240/2-1-as-a-secure-access-pointa few https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1962/how-to-enable-wifi-access-point-hotspot-on-my-moto-droid-2-2-without-editingtethering https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/7105/wifi-tethering-unavailable-htc-magicquestions https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/3078/how-can-i-enable-the-wifi-hotspot-capability-on-my-moto-droid-1-without-using-adhhere.
We sometimes get questions that are totally obscure, either because people are trying to do really crazy things with their device (someone was asking about setting up a Ruby development environment the other day) or they're trying to use some really obscure app that nobody else has heard of. These generally don't get any answers, or just get poor ones.
I personally think we get a rather unfortunate amount of just plain bad questions. Usually things of the nature "My phone's [feature] isn't working. How can I fix it?" with no symptoms or other details. These are pretty much the same as the bad questions SO gets, but it's really impossible to guess what's happening here, whereas on SO you can often take an educated guess based on past experiences or common programming mistakes. Comments are left on said questions, but the posters very rarely follow up on them. We also seem to attract subjective "Which phone should I buy?" or "What's the best app for X?" questions, which dilute the good content.
People aren't voting as much as they were in the beta. I have no hard evidence for this, but I will say that I feel like I see a lot more questions and answers that are good and useful but only sitting at +1 (or even 0). I'm not excluding myself from this, either, and I'm trying to vote more (though I've been gone recently). Obviously this has a negative impact on the growth of any potential "middle class".
I agree with Matthew Read: We get a fair number of users who just use this site as tech support and then never come back. It's convenient, it says "Android" in the title, and it's got the adorable green robots. It certainly seems like as good a place as any to dump a quick "help me plz" question.


That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though.

That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02.

I've received a few downvotes on some answers and I've just been curious about the reasons for the votes. I'd love to see a mandatory comment for the reason of the vote, so that I could improve my future answers or questions. 

The optimal way would be a textinput when a user clicks the downvote button asking for the reason, which would be shown somehow next to the question/answer, but I'd settle for even a comment.

Do you think this would be a good idea?

  App recommendations (what's a good X app)?
  App comparisons (which is a better X app, Y or Z)?
  General network questions (what's the difference between 3G and 4G)?
  General device questions (what's a Candy Bar form factor)?
  Tactics for Android games (which may or may not be unique to Android)?


Off-topic.  Recommendations can get a pass if they're very specific and there's a real problem you're trying to solve, but we prefer "How can I do X?" rather than "Is there an app that does X?"  We only take questions about Android, so network/carrier questions are off-topic when they have nothing to do with Android.  Device question are off-topic as well if they're not Android-specific; asking whether an Android phone has a particular feature is different from asking about general cellphone form factors.  Android games are on-topic at gaming.stackexchange.com, not here.


  Carrier/network concerns - (is phone X compatible with carrier Y)?
  Extremely basic questions (how do I use the alarm clock)?
  Obscure tech support questions (error X in app-that-nobody's-heard-of Y)?


On topic.  Note the caveat above — your example is on-topic because it's about an Android phone, but carrier/network questions are not on-topic when divorced from Android.  This is all discussed here on Meta, but if the FAQ needs work I'll look into it as soon as I can.

I think most of those could be broadly summarized as 


  What problem are you trying to solve?


and


  ... do you have reason to believe it can be solved with an Android device?

If I found such a broad definition useful, I wouldn't have asked the question. The "what problem are you trying to solve" in particular doesn't really have to do with scope at all, just constructiveness.

It probably breaks Amazon's TOS and they could ban an invalid account, but there are no legal ramifications that I'm aware of here.  Circumventing DRM is still legal here as well, at least for now.  Out of curiosity: Is rooting illegal in the EU? Does backing up apps count as piracy?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matthew Don't know what apps/backups count as, but in the UK the law is just being changed now to make it legal to rip your own CDs/DVDs as a digital backup. It's been illegal (but ignored) up until now, as everyone's obviously been using MP3 players with ripped music on for years illegally.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matthew You can backup apps that you legally own. You can pretty much do whatever you want with them as long as it doesn't fall into "illegal distribution". In some countries, reverse engineering is a crime as well. The problem is that with the regional limitation bypass you are gaining access to something that you shouldn't have access to in the first place.


















I don't think questions about getting around (often arbitrary) regional restrictions are the same as piracy and shouldn't be conflated. There are any number of legitimate reasons why someone might need to do such a thing.

While I hate to fall back on this old chestnut, we're not experts in law. Further, the law varies by jurisdiction and the web (and this site) is international. If it's a gray area we should offer our knowledge; it's up to the recipient to know, and pay the consequences, if they take the knowledge they gain here and use it to break the law. (If you're afraid that someone will use information you give for nefarious purposes, don't give it.)

All that said, any obvious piracy and warez trading gets smacked down pretty quickly around here. Of course, it helps when users flag things for moderator attention, because moderators can't be everywhere.

The market would insist that your SIM card is from USA and therefore you can't access the Germany-only content.

When I go to https://android.stackexchange.com/privilegesthe privileges page, "remove new user restrictions" in the list on the right side overflows into the percentage column, forcing a wrap.  This in in Chrome 13.

In IE8, I see different behavior; each percentage is on the line following the name of the privilege, instead of being on the same line.  This occurs everywhere in the list, but here's the bottom three again:

When I click the "remove new user restrictions" link, the bolded text wraps:

Firefox 5.0.1, 6.0, and 6.0.2 show the normal list correctly, with the percentage on the same line as the name of the privilege.  However, when I click the "remove new user restrictions" link, the text becomes bolded and mushes into the percentage:

My resolution is 1050 x 1680, and I'm using Windows XP.

BUMP!

This is a question regarding the theme of android.stackexchange.com and meta.android.stackexchange.com.

Why is the font weight bold for almost everything on the sites? Am I the only one who finds that it strains my eyes? I often find it hard to focus on what I am supposed to.

I find it is ok to have titles, headings etc in bold but not the entire content of these websites.

EDIT

Posting screenshots of android.stackexchange.com and stackoverflow.com for comparison. I am using Firefox 6.0.1 on Windows XP SP3.

None of the body text in people's questions and answers is (except where sections have been deliberately bolded).

Seems to me you have a messed up Droid font installed.

The CSS font stack on this site is 

font-family: 'Droid Sans','DroidSansRegular','Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;


Check your system and uninstall any "Droid" fonts you may have. Then http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sansre-install them properly. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't have any "Droid" font installed on my system!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@adarshr do you have Helvetica installed by any chance? If not, then I'm not sure what's going on with your system since I can't reproduce what you see.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I have these Helvetica fonts: HelvNeue35.ttf, HelvNeue45.ttf, HelvNeue55.ttf, HelvNeue65.ttf and HelvNeue75.ttf. I just noticed a difference - this happens only on my Firefox.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I will go home and confirm if this happens on my personal laptop (Vista, FF6) as well.


















I've thought about this some more, and I think we had a bit of a shift after the site went public.  Though I won't point them out, there were a few highly active users I can think of who largely disappeared after that.

I'm not sure why that happened, but I do wonder if it's related to the rep requirements suddenly doubling.  I was about to hit 10k rep then (Trusted User) and it was a bit of a shock when I realized I was going to have to duplicate my entire performance so far just in order to get back where I was before, since now Trusted User is 20k rep.

That must have been immensely discouraging for some users.  Maybe now we're just waiting for new users to come up and fill the middle tier that was suddenly vacated by the change in rep requirements?

I'm not sure it makes sense to have the same rep requirements as a huge site like SO either.  I would happily trust GAThrawn or eldarerathis, for example, with the 10k tools.  Their work flagging and close-voting is immensely useful and they have great judgment.  We don't require mods to have 20k rep before making them mods, right?  I'm the only one over 20k and I just got there recently!

Maybe we already have a middle class, and we're just not making effective use of them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do tend to agree with your second point (however self-serving that may seem). The influx of questions on SO is so great that hitting 10k rep (or 5k, or 2k, etc) isn't that hard if you want to do it, but this and other sites just move more slowly. SO is a very different ecosystem than any other SE site, so maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to consider adapting smaller sites a little bit in light of that fact.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually I think the rep requirements more than doubled after beta. I had the mod tools with 2K (I think) during beta, haven't got them back yet, and I'm standing at over 8K now. I know it was quite a disappointment to suddenly lose all my powers, though I do understand why. Can agree that it would make sense to do some kind of scaling on rep requirements (maybe based on total active users, or total rep of all users or something similar) this would also mean that beta sites wouldn't need an exception for rep requirements, they'd just be a small site, with appropriately small rep reqs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would probably be better for new/small sites to have dynamic rep limit, e.g. top N user or top X% of user having certain level of privileges, to ensure there is always someone to fill certain roles.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LieRyan: yes, but that's not easy to calibrate. You might get positions full with people no longer on the site but still with high rep (since it doesn't fade), and you might simply not get enough people for the job.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lohoris: you won't need to calibrate it; the dynamic rep limit I was suggesting was only for the earliest stage of the site, say, in the first 6 months, when normal rep limit would rule everyone out of every privileges; dynamic rep limit would let the privileges grow together with the site.


















I don't think that's a good question for the site. It is, after all, subjective, a poll, and an infinite list. It's different than a resource like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/7680/when-will-my-device-get-the-android-3-x-update-honeycombWhen will my tablet get the Android 3.x update (Honeycomb)? because that's dealing with facts (and, admittedly, rumors) but that can be confirmed.

It also covers similar ground as https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questionsWhere can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions? Perhaps that question should be on meta?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do think it's useful, though it's not perfect.  Anyways, I did consider whether it should be on meta.  I think the question you link has a lot to do with the scope of this site (a good Meta topic) but consider [Where can I find device reviews?](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/8757/where-can-i-find-device-reviews). I don't think that's a suitable Meta question, and it's clearly a user concern. Like you noted on it, we don't handle shopping advice, but we can make a good starting point for people to go get advice.



















  On the one hand I would prefer one site per answer so that we can vote
  on them individually and the good ones can rise to the top. This also
  makes sense since it's impossible to create a single definitive answer
  (some editors will find a particular site useful and others won't).


Well, there are a few problems with these questions. Older answers will by default have more votes than newer answers, so for a question that's been open for months, you can't judge anything about the quality of a site/answer by the number of votes (unless they're into the negative, in which case it's a useless answer that misleads visitors who don't understand our voting and should probably be deleted).


  Once the answers overflow a page, though, you get into a situation
  where new answers never get seen or voted on, since few people go to
  the next page.


I think the StackExchange team have tried to combat this effect over time. Unlike us, who've all been here long enough and clicked enough links to change all the defaults, new users coming to those pages will see a semi-random ordering of the answers (I think there's an activity bias to the randomness) so no two visitors should see the same "first page" of answers.

I'd be tempted to say that if we keep these type of questions on the main site, then rather than treating them as a popularity contest between the answers, we do something more like the other "community resource" questions (like the "when will my phone get updated", "how do I root" type-stuff). So we make (almost) no obvious judgement on the quality of the sites and edit them all into one community wiki answer by category. (obviously the quality bar of each site will now be whether a user thinks they're good enough to nominate, after that all linked sites are treated equally).

In this https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/13290/is-there-anyway-to-bypass-the-verizon-wireless-block-of-the-tetheringquestion about bypassing TOS on a device and allowing free tethering, is there any danger of legal action being taken against Android Enthusiasts or SE in general?  I am aware that there are several sites/forums/etc that offer advice for doing just this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask the question.

As others have indicated, perhaps go a bit deeper and ask:


  Maybe this question doesn't work because it doesn't belong here.


I would in fact argue this question really shouldn't be here -- any more than "favorite/best/most useful .NET/Java blog" should exist on Stack Overflow.

(This is generally known as the "Infinite List of X" problem.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This it is, then. Glad to see I don't even need to propose the deletion of these questions for it to be agreed upon :P


















I'm not a lawyer (I am a law student), but the short answer is likely "yes."
Third party interference in a contract (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interferenceTortious Interference) applies here, since you're actually encouraging a party to breach their contractual obligations by circumventing anti-tethering measures.
Will carriers ever sue a site for hosting such information? There's been no sign they will, yet, but as paid tethering becomes more ingrained into the mobile data payment structure, and the majority of Americans start to see it as part of "cell phone service," I imagine they'll start taking some kind of action.
Speaking from the carrier's point of view (not that I agree with it), they'd compare it to posting an FAQ on how to send unlimited text messages, using the carrier's SMS, while hiding that information from the carrier (if that were possible - it's just a hypothetical).
Obviously, this would be seen as "stealing service." I think in the future, C&D letters may start popping up in inboxes of websites that post tethering circumvention methods, but who knows what the carriers will do, or when they'll do it.
EDIT: There's probably also related FCC regulations that might apply here, though the fact that it's mobile internet that you're "stealing" makes it unclear to me just how those regulations might be used here, if at all. You'd have to ask a telecom lawyer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think a more likely scenario is that some user uses a piece of advice here, their carrier detects it and completely cuts off their service, and now the user wants to come after us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm sure SE's ToS would preclude such an action.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A more apt comparison would be telling the user that they can use their data plan to send unlimited SMSes via Google Voice.  They're already paying for the data, it shouldn't matter how they use it.  One can torrent from their phone, which surely uses more bandwidth than viewing a web page from a laptop; I wish the lawmakers were technically savvy enough to understand that.  It's not like the carriers won't throttle you if you start downloading a lot anyways, whether from your phone or from a tethered device.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like I said, I don't agree with the comparison, but as an analogy it is sound and would probably stand up to muster in a court.

There's been tons of debate on this and the FCC has basically caved to the carriers and given them free reign on things like this, because they constitute "reasonable network management." Lawmakers could step in, but there's a lot of pro-carrier lobbying to get through, and the carriers would scream bloody murder.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's true.  I'm glad I live in Canada :P our laws aren't perfect either but ones like this are rarely enforced.


















In my opinion, this depends.

What is the motivation of the person asking? Is it to steal stuff and avoid paying for it?

Or is it to solve some actual legitimate technical problem they have, which they can't solve by any other legal means?

In the latter case I'm inclined to allow it because the motivation is honest.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For this particular case the user doesn't want to pay $25/month because he only uses the service occasionally.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm inclined to say it's not the former case, because he's already paying for the data. It shouldn't matter how he uses it, and the carrier will throttle him regardless.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The FCC has weighed in on this, and the carriers apparently have the right to do whatever it is they want in terms of throttling and tethering because it constitutes "reasonable network management."

If you're asking for a *legal* opinion on this, the intent of the user or the site hosting the information is totally irrelevant. Tethering is not a right, unfortunately, it is an "optional feature" subject to the whims of your carrier.


















I call your attention to the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/blockingblocking tag.

I see questions in there about blocking applications, calls, SMS messages, and processes.

That's no good.

I suggest the following replacements:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/call-blockingcall-blocking
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sms-blockingsms-blocking
[app-blocking]


The one about processes is an outlier. I don't think "blocking" is an appropriate tag/descriptor.

I also suggest that https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/blockingblocking be a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/call-blockingcall-blocking as that is how it is used most often. We don't want people to use the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/blockingblocking tag anymore.

I suppose one could suss out the minor difference between _blocking_ and _screening_, but won't most people just use them synonymously?


















I think it makes a lot of sense to split these up sensibly, I'd propose something like this


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/call-screeningcall-screening <- https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/call-blockingcall-blocking*
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sms-blockingsms-blocking


Do we really need an https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/app-blockingapp-blocking tag? The one question that I think you're nominating for it, is really a PC question rather than an Android one (and quite an edge case even there) I'd think it would be better off on SuperUser than here, and even then I think "locking" is probably closer to what is happening than blocking (seems to be to do with locked handles on mounted drives/files). 

*I'd think that call-blocking should be set to a synonym of call-screening (as surely blocking is just a type of screening where you don't allow the call through after screening it). One of the call-screening questions even mentions blocking in the title.

Of course these questions are https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5709/where-are-the-sim-lock-settings-stored-on-an-android-phonehardware specific, and in many ways not actually Android specific, but they do keep coming up every now and then.

Do we need a central "How do I remove the SIM lock on my Android phone?" question that can be wiki'd and explain the issues and either link to model specific answers, or list the ones that have come up so far in it?

There are others, however.

(This particular question is way too specific, asking about a bug release version on a particular device, but it should illustrate the point.)

Anyway, what do we want to do with questions like this? There is no official "changelog" we can refer people to, except where there is a major revision. Even so, a change to just the third node in the version number is almost certainly nothing but bug fixes.

Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as "too localized", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them.

Would it be worth it to have canonical questions for each of the major versions? We could add point-releases like this to the major version if we can suss out what was changed.

  Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as "too localized", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them.


They're way too localized. Even a question like "what's new in Android 4.0?" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example).

An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial.

Update: The split is done. Whats still on the ToDo list is the blacklisting of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/flashflash.

There was/is some inconsistency with the flash tag. It meant either:


To flash a new ROM
Adobe Flash
The camera's flash


I suggest the following split:


flashing: For flashing a device
adobe-flash: For Adobe Flash
camera-flash: For a questions regarding a camera flash


Which leaves the question for what flash should be a synonym? I think that the best choice would be adobe-flash.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we handle the flash tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5definitely a good idea


















Good spot, there's a definite need to split those up.

"adobe-flash" and "camera-flash" absolutely should be split up, and they sound like the right names for the tags.

I'd say that "flashing" as a bare word still has scope for confusion (and also some slightly less savoury connotations). Can't think of the exact phrase, but I'm thinking it could be something like "rom-flashing" "os-flashing" or "hardware-flashing".

However for the old "flash" tag, it doesn't really make sense to have it as a synonym of any of those (the fact that we'll have to split it into three separate tags, already makes me think it's not going to be a true synonym of any of those). I'd suggest instead that "flash" should be removed and blacklisted to stop anyone recreating it. Then anyone trying to use a "flash" tag will get the three above tags as suggestions and won't be able to use a confusing "flash" tag.

Blacklisting *flash* and changing *flash* to *adobe-flash* should be the next step. But maybe *flashing* should become a synonym for *(rom-flashing|hardware-flashing|device-flashing)*. Not sure which one would be best :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like `rom-flashing`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`rom-flashing` works for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I merged `flash` to -> `adobe-flash` and `flashing` to -> `rom-flashing`.  A dev will have to blacklist `flash` for us.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BryanDenny [flash] is a synonym of [adobe-flash] now...that doesn't seem to go along with a request to blacklist it...?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RebeccaChernoff I did that until it could be blacklisted such that it wouldn't create the flash tag anymoreb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've undone the synonym -- if `flash` fades away it doesn't need to be blacklisted unless it comes back.


















I'm seeing lots of questions on the site where people are basically saying "Here's a great guide to X" and the content links off site.

My immediate thought is that Android Enthusiasts is the site I've come to find answers, not indexed answers linking offsite. I would argue that an answer with some text to pad a link to someones blog or article is a faux answer.

Is this a community preference? In what situations would linking off site be acceptable?

e.g. Vendor specific rooting, specific answer, or offsite linking?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why do many of the answers posted here on Android seem to link offsite?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note also: [Are answers that are just links Answers?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/906)


















If someone's asking a complicated question, which only has long, complicated answers, which are already written up elsewhere, would you prefer that the question doesn't ever get an answer here, because no one wants to spend a lot of time rewriting something that's already out there on a more specialised site? Or that there's something descriptive and helping out by pointing someone to that helpful article?

From what I've seen, most of the answers that link offsite are either questions about one very specific app having a very obscure problem, or problems with people using obscure ROMs on obscure hardware and having obscure problems. We just don't have enough different people here regularly using enough different ROMs on enough different hardware, with enough different apps. There's hundreds of Android handsets, each of them has tens of different ROMs in various versions and there's hundreds of thousands of apps.

We would need an awful lot of people to cover obscure problems with all of that. Compare that to say, an iOS site that only has six possible hardware devices, a handful of OS versions (and almost no use at all of third party modified OSs).

I'll go write me up some answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5still, the policy per http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-answer is to avoid answers that are just a link.

AFAIK the Kindle Fire runs on a custom version of Android - would questions on these be on-topic when it's released?

If the device is running such a version of Android, then I would say questions are fair game.  Additionally, it will still run Android apps from the Amazon Market, so it may be fine even as a stock device.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since the Fire will run Android apps from the Amazon Market, there likely will be relevant questions, even though the base UI is heavily customized.


















I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why.

A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it — the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say "go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said"; premature questions generally get closed.

Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)

The answer is simple: Because it is more convenient to just post a link instead of a comprehensive answer.

But, as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/14074/how-can-i-stop-the-android-market-from-showing-bad-naughty-appsthis questions demonstrates, users like it when it's more convenient for them. https://android.stackexchange.com/users/156/gathrawnGAThrawn and I have posted the same answer (I think we even googled the same page :-)), but mine was more rewarded by the community. I think mostly because my answer already contained everything that's needed, whereas the answer from https://android.stackexchange.com/users/156/gathrawnGAThrawn contains a short answer and a link.
So it was beneficial for me to include as many information as possible in my answer, including the source. 

I think that this be pointed out for new users/when posting answers:

A link as a first answer is a good start, but if the answer contains nearly everything that's needed, the chanches for upvoting are way higher (reputation $$$).

I am still surprised by the amount of upvotes that mine got....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's better to qualify answers with links but write them up well so you don't have to go offsite. Long term this means less dead links (and users with high rep can update answers to be relevant as time goes on).


















Given the (relativly) fast evolving process of Android development, there will always be obsolete answers. I wonder how to handle these?

I think edit is best when the answer has only changed e.g. for a new release of android. 

But what is considered best practice when it comes to a answer like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4955/how-to-change-the-account-for-android-market/4960#4960this? I am not sure, but I think the Market update, which brought multi-account support, was rolled-out on every Android devices (or >= 2.0?). The answer suggests a factory reset, where nowadays some clicks will do it. What possibilities are there to fix this? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we handle obsolete answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks like there is a competitive answer http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4955/how-to-change-the-account-for-android-market/14182#14182 that now reflects the new changes to the Market.  An edit to the answer marked as "the answer" referring to the other more up to date answer would probably be the correct approach to this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thare are lots of obsolete questions and answers here in android enthusiasts much more than in any other community I know of.


















Personally, I would add a separate answer (as P.T. did in this case).  He provided the up-to-date information and should get credit for it.  So far he's got 40 rep from the answer than he wouldn't have gotten by editing the other answer, and I think he deserves it.  It also serves to alert the post owner that things have changed, which an edit would not.  Finally, the editing page says you should "clarify meaning without changing it".  This sort of edit would clearly be changing the meaning.

If the post is CW then an edit is appropriate, of course.  For example, Separate answers on https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-deviceour rooting question have been deleted and incorporated into the main post since we want everything to be cohesive.

It's certainly inappropriate to downvote the outdated answer (IMO) since the answer was correct and useful at the time it was posted; it's not the answerer's fault that Google changed the game.  I would consider adding a a phrase like "At the time of posting" to the outdated answer, though, just to make it clear that the answer was once correct to anyone unfamiliar with the history of the issue.  As Bryan notes you could also mention the newer answer in an edit, but I would be careful with this; you probably don't want to edit another answer to point to your own since it may be viewed unfavorably.

(And "wrong" answers should never be flagged, outdated or not.)

Who should edit the accepted flag if the OP does not do this? Imagine someone googles the question, only reads the accepted answer and does therefore a factory reset, just to find out later that it wasn't necessary....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow Accepting an answer is always, always up to the asker of the question. If users really need to skim they should rely on votes. Perhaps "As of  this is no longer necessary" could be edited in instead of "At the time of posting", and again posting a separate answer should alert the asker who will hopefully change their acceptance.


















Edit, edit, edit, OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, EDIIIIT!
One of the most frustrating aspects of trying to track down a solution to a problem online is the mountain of dated answers you must wade through, usually without any clear indication that they are, in fact, obsolete.
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4955/how-to-change-the-account-for-android-market/4960#4960Your example is a prime example of this problem: how irritated would you be, if you found the question, followed the advice in the top answer, only to find out later that you'd missed a much, much easier solution further down the page? I've edited this to indicate the historical nature of the technique and point out the new answer. Note that while https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/635/how-should-we-handle-obsolete-answers/636#636Matthew is correct in noting that edits which fundamentally change the meaning of an answer are discouraged, this is meant more to avoid controversy - if an answer was once correct, editing to make it correct again does, in a sense, preserve that intent.
A more interesting scenario might involve an answer that becomes incorrect in a new version of the OS. Since not everyone will be able to upgrade, you'll want to preserve the original answer... But you'll also want to clearly note that it only applies to specific releases. If you want to go the extra mile and compile a comprehensive, "Here's how to accomplish X in every Android version" answer, that's even better.
Note that editing does not preclude also answering. If a substantial amount of new information is required to provide an up-to-date answer, posting this separately can be much cleaner than trying to cram it into an existing answer. It's a judgement call, really - but in no event should you quietly ignore an incorrect answer just to make your own look better - edit, down-vote, comment, or flag (in that order) as needed to ensure it isn't left as a stumbling block for future readers.
Down-voting
If an answer is incorrect, unhelpful, or even just mediocre compared to other answers on the question, please down-vote it. And also up-vote the more useful answer(s). In the absence of an "accepted" answer, this will change the default sort order to put the more helpful answers nearer to the question and the top of the page.
Flag for moderator attention
If you see an "accepted" answer (green checkmark to the left, pinned directly below the question) that is flat-out incorrect, and for whatever reason are not able to edit it to correct the problem... Then leave a detailed comment describing the issue (and ideally linking to a correct answer) and then leave a flag notifying a moderator. When necessary, moderators can delete accepted answers, something even the owner of the answer cannot do... In order for this to happen, it should be obvious that the answer is, in fact, incorrect and uncorrectable - don't assume moderators are familiar with the subtleties of the topic being answered, give them the information they need to make that call.

I am not sure, but this doesn't seems correct. My reputation by post and day reads "votes" when it should read "edits":


I have edited "How can i disable Phone, SMS, Market and 3G functionality from Android two times in a row, but the reputation at the "+4" says line says it got it for votes?

We have currently these i18n related tags:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/localizationlocalization
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/internationalizationinternationalization with the synonym "i18n"


They both http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization#Nomenclaturedescribe technically different approaches, but I doubt that the average AN.SX users is aware of this. On Android i18n is the way to go, yet the majority of the questions is tagged with "localization".

I suggest merging all i18n related tags into one tag. But I am not sure which tag it should be.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we merge all i18n related tags into one?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It probably makes sense for them to be synonyms.  If `localization` is the majority, that's what I'd go with.  It also makes more sense to me -- users want the device to be localized, the don't care if the manufacturer has fully internationalized.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead That's what I meant with merging. Make "internationalization" and "i18n" synonyms of "localization". :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems reasonable to me.


















Update x2: See https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/667/samsung-galaxy-sii-twitter-se-giveaway-official-postthe official contest meta post.

Update: This contest will now be taking place next week (10.17-10.21). Also, instead of leaving an Answer, contestants will only have to gain 5 points across the Android site during the contest period to increase their chances of winning 3x. Eligible participants will be calculated on the back-end by the Community & CHAOS teams and a winner will be randomly generated and announced at the end of the contest period. Stay tuned for the official contest post, published Monday.

.....

We have a Galaxy SII to giveaway via Twitter tomorrow (Wednesday 10/12). RT a message announced tomorrow morning, and your name will be entered into a random drawing. 

This is an outreach initiative, and the main purpose is to use this goodie to spread the word on Android.SE. But I want to make sure that established Stack Exchange users have a leg up on the competition here. Also, I want to try something new.

With that in mind, I've proposed contestants can double (or triple - I'm undecided here) their chances by leaving an "Answer" in the official contest meta post. Leaving an answer in meta requires 5 rep points.

In a brief chat yesterday, @MatthewRead cleared using a meta Answer as contest platform in this instance. Depending on how it turns out, this may be a one and done contest model.

Any thoughts? Should an answer 2x or 3x a participant's chances? We want established users to be rewarded. Also, we want newbies to participate on the site (but not perversely). Yet we don't want to strongly discourage RT-ing the tweet as making this a Twitter contest was a precondition to receiving the phone.

Lemme know your thoughts!

Does the five points need to come from site participation or does the 101 points you get from linking to another exchange count?

Methinks participation should be required.

Umm - if everyone gets a 2x or 3x, you'll have the same probability of winning. It doesn't matter. You could do a 10x probability. Everything still remains the same.

Or did I miss something?

How will you link Twitter accounts with the persons stack exchange account? Will we have to register in some way?

There's no separate place to put twitterid in account settings.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe it'll be posted as a question on the site and we can use the tweet link feature? That'll probably register in the SO database that we've tweeted it. #guessb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BernhardHofmann - You'll simply have to add your twitter account to one of any of the fields in your SE profile. I will clarify the instructions when the official meta post is published Monday.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for clarifying that. Looking forward to a chance to win that great phone. (This comment written on my HTC WildFire.)


















Asking about feasibility and how-to is fine.  Asking for experiences is polling, though, which falls under Not Constructive.  We generally close such questions.  Slipping it in as "How well does it work as a phone?" should be OK, though.

I don't see any difference between https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mobile-phonesmobile-phones and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cellphonescellphones. Should we merge them? :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we merge mobilephones with cellphones?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They should be blacklisted IMO.  (In the meantime I've merged them.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead what's the advantage of blacklisting?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They're useless tags, really.  1 was closed in `mobile-phones` and I just closed 4 more.  People tend to use them for shopping recommendations, or just at random because they're technically asking about a cell phone.  If they are asking a valid question that generally applies to Android phones, they should use tags about the specific issue rather than `android`, `cellphones`, `general-question` or the like.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead A false tagged question is one thing. But on the other side I see no harm done when using this tag appropriate. A good example for [tag:cellphone] would be [this question](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/14625/on-which-android-tablets-is-gsm-telephony-feasible). And I am sure that there are other questions about the cellphone functionality too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not about cellphones, that would only be confusing.  The particular phone functionality in question is calling, covered by the `calls` tag.


















We have several posts on the site, listed below, which belong to https://android.stackexchange.com/users/254/kyle-croninKyle Cronin but aren't associated with his account (the username is greyed out), presumably due to migration from the Electronic Gadgets site.  Could a dev type person correct this?  Or provide mods the tools to do so?  :P

Sorry for all the flags, but https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76/link-migrated-questions-and-answers-to-user-account/156#156I was told it was the correct procedure. And there are also some comments as well that I was unable to flag. In general, it's pretty safe to assume if you have content that is attributed to "Kyle Cronin" but without an account associated, it's stuff that I contributed to Gadgets and would like associated with my account here. Thanks.

It would be nice if the regular mods had the power to merge "dead" users with real users, or something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead You're right, after a few months they probably thought I forgot or didn't care, or that there were no further issues. And as a moderator on another site, I completely agree that we should have the ability to deal with situations like this ourselves without needing to involve the dev team.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: for the time being, you can either post here like you did, or just contact the community team via the usual channels and we'll route it. If there's a significant *volume* of these requests, we can look at other options. These should be fairly *rare* though.


















This takes dev intervention to accomplish. Incantations. Goat blood. Dark magik - that's right, magic with a k for ekstra dark.

That's why the latest CDD is 2.3.3.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then, assuming they follow through and open (like they say they will) a CDD will be published at that time?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Al Everett That's what I'd expect, now the only question is when... I'm just impatient :)


















We send a lot of people to other Android-related sites, presumably because the information there is richer, specialized, or more complete.

But who out there is talking about http://android.stackexchange.comAndroid Enthusiasts? Are we getting any love from the Android community?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Who is talking about Android.StackExchange.com?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a mod on another site, I'm constantly frustrated that the mod tools will show you traffic per domain, but won't give you the exact URLs the traffic is coming from. So you can see that you got 2000 hits from domain XYZ, but you go there and you have no idea where your site was mentioned. I wish SE would add referring URLs to the mod analytics. /rant

Congratulations to Mike Stride (http://twitter.com/#!/stridermike@stridermike) of Southport, UK, who was one of 272 people to enter by RT-ing the http://twitter.com/#!/StackHQ/status/125935452384538624@STackHQ contest announcement. Stride did not triple his chances of winning by earning 5 rep on the Android site.

I should have been more clear, and in future contests I will be.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SamTheBrandΨ FWIW, I think that having an account definitely *should* be a prerequisite to win.

The https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applicationsapplications tag is only supposed to be used for questions that are about Android applications in general. Unfortunately, that hasn't always happened.

Here are a few of the misuses:


the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment tag tells people not to use it, so they use "applications" instead
the question is about a single application, which may or may not have its own tag already
none of the tags the asker wants exists, or they don't really want to add any, and it's almost always listed as a tag suggestion, so they add it because they're forced to add a tag
there has been a question or two that use other definitions of "application", mainly "an act of putting to use"


Not to mention the "application recommendation" questions we're really prefer not to have.

There are a lot of questions in this tag, and I'd estimate at least a third of these (if not more) are misuses of the tag.

So, if you're of a mind to help with some housecleaning, please do so. Don't worry if you don't have sufficient privs. Editing suggestions are very helpful too. (Moderators can't be everywhere at once, you know. Plus you can get free reputation points.)

One thing that would help would be to delete some of the large number of closed questions with this tag. Try https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=[applications]+closed%3A1this search to find them.

Better to let those just die.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Man, just deleting the giant collection of closed development questions seems like it will make a pretty big dent. A **ton** of them are tagged with `applications`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to more easily find closed questions tagged "applications", here's a [search URL](http://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=[applications]+closed%3A1)


















I'm not familiar with Honeycomb and assumed that 3.0 vs 3.1 was more akin to 2.2 vs 2.3 than it was to 2.3.3 vs 2.3.4.  If the opposite is the case then the merge and rename to 3.x-honeycomb makes sense to me!

The 2.0-eclair -> 2.1-eclair mapping is a sure thing, I went ahead and did that bit now.  Almost no one uses 2.0, and 2.x implies 2.2 and 2.3 are included, so I think there will be less confusion if left as 2.1-eclair.

(Follow a consistent numbering scheme, Google!)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, good point about the 2.x. I must have had a vapor lock when I forgot about Froyo and Gingerbread.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the only real end-user change that took place in the 3.x iterations was the app zooming functionality in 3.2. Almost everything else was developer-facing changes to the APIs. That being said, I'm kind of indifferent.


















BlueTooth is wireless, but it isn't wifi.

Depending on the use, I could see wireless-network and wireless-networking merged, but Wifi is a specific type of wireless technology.

Grammatically, "wireless-networking" refers to the concept or practice, and "wireless-network" refers to a implemented instance. But I doubt those subtleties are present...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for "I doubt those subtleties are present"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I expect that after reviewing [tag:wireless-network] and [tag:wireless-networking] the vast majority of the questions can be moved to [tag:wifi] with maybe a couple for Bluetooth or otherwise not taggable as "wifi". But I agree that wireless-network and wireless-networking can probably be merged.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett I retagged the minority that didn't fit in.  I think we should be good to merge all three tags.


















Once in a while I see questions that are off topic but not belonging to either meta or stackoverflow. On such case, how should we mark the off topic question?

Edit:
What I'm asking is when marking as off topic, I can only choose meta and stackoverflow as correct place, what if the question doesn't belong to either site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What to do with off topic questions not belonging on meta or stackoverflowb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Though there are only two "belongs on..." options shown in that box, you also have the option of **not** ticking either the Meta or StackOverflow boxes, this then effectively means "it belongs somewhere else"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There can only ever be a maximum of five other destinations to suggest when voting to close as "off topic". Since we rarely see anything prime for another SE site besides SO, we haven't added any other options. As has been mentioned, flag it and use the "other" option and mention where you think the question belongs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe we could also add [Programmers](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/) -- though it might be hard to distinguish them from SO at times :)


















Vote to close as off-topic, if you don't have the necessary reputation to do that you can alternatively flag as off-topic, so that a moderator can close the question.

If the question would fit on any other SE site, you can flag for a moderator and explain which site you think it should be migrated to. Moderators have the ability to migrate to any site in the SE network.

Completely off-topic questions should also be deleted a while after they were closed, they just clutter up the site with stuff that just doesn't belong on the site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What I'm asking is when marking as off topic, I can only choose meta and stackoverflow as correct place, what if the question doesn't belong to either site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then you need to flag for a moderator, they can migrate everywhere. Just use the "other" reason for that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, what Fabian said.  We can migrate to any site, just flag the question if it looks like a good question for here.


















I think only #2 is acceptable, though it might be closed as a dupe.  #1 and #5 are way too subjective, #3 is an off-topic shopping advice question, and #4 isn't a question :P.  (Note we don't take speculative questions either, which applies to most questions about 4.0 and the Fire right now.)

If a contest wants to use questions here I think they still need to be real questions, real problems, asked and answerable from a user's perspective.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ugh. Beat me to it.


















Sounds right to me.  The new tag is https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nook-colornook-color with no synonyms.  Two questions were about the app, and are now tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nook-for-androidnook-for-android instead.

Please answer if you've asked or if you see an https://android.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=votesunanswered Android question that you think is a good question today and will remain a useful question in 6 months.

Once we identify a few, we'll consider offering up https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/686/a-kindle-fire-giveaway-lets-discussa physical bounty!

Thx for the help!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What Old(er) Unanswered Questions are Still Relevant Today?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that one week is to short to produce quality answers for long-time unanswered questions. 3-4 weeks would be better and also attract more people to the contest.


















I don't know how much work this would be, but it would be nice if questions migrated from here to Stack Overflow were automatically tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/androidandroid.  I generally follow up and retag the SO version after a migration, but I wouldn't expect all users with the VTC privilege to do so.

This is great. Any way we can create a system message or do something else to nudge users to dig thru the old unanswered questions and submit them here? Or how about... can you sort old unanswered questions by view count (I can't) to see what garners interest today?

I'd like to maybe nominate 10 or 15 old questions for this initiative & attach a "bounty" -- answer a question, throw your name in the hat for a Kindle Fire.

Also, I don't see why moderators can't be eligible here.

It might be valuable to expand our current question to include version numbers.  The "gingerbreak" exploit has been fixed in newer versions of 2.3, for example.

I think having a separate question for each device would get out of hand, however.  That list has 50ish devices, which would basically mean 50 times the upkeep if they were split up.  I do understand your point about voting, but I think the community can be trusted to remove terrible instructions, add disclaimers, and add newer/better instructions.

If there are unique circumstances, e.g., something that should work for your device and version does not or softbricks your device or something, you can absolutely ask a separate question about that.  So far the wiki has been pretty useful in keeping all of the basic questions from cluttering the site and being harder to find, though -- there are 69 dupes.

Several of us who are familiar with XDA and other sites frequent http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25the chat room.  I and I'm sure others would gladly try to help you find the info you're looking for if you give us the details.  The other method to try to solicit this information is through a bounty on the wiki question stating what you need.

As for the problem at hand: Have you tried following the guides listed at the top of http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1067813this XDA thread?  In particular, some variant of Koush's (flashing recovery and then a rooting package or a rooted ROM) should work regardless of your software version, since the Nexus S has an unlockable bootloader.

I've updated the first section of the https://android.stackexchange.com/faqFAQ. I hope that some clarity there will reduce the number of off-topic questions we've been getting.

I welcome any suggestions for improvement.

Although, frankly, I think rooting is so big and yet so specialized that we're not a good resource for such questions (the omnibus question about rooting excepted).

We have 5 Kindle Fires for giveaway to 5 Android.StackExchange users who best answer one or several particular unanswered questions posed on this site.



The Rules:


Leave an answer at one or several of 22 questions in the "Kindle Fire Contest." These are questions that have been left unanswered for some time, and that may hold relevance to Android users and troubleshooting Googlers into the future. Improve the Internet... earn a chance at a Kindle Fire!
For every answer you leave that is either accepted or the top upvoted answer on the question, your name will be entered to win a Kindle Fire.
Results will be calculated and winners will be picked in a random drawing on Monday, Dec. 5 at 10am EST.
Contest participants may answer multiple questions -- in fact, it is in your best interest to do so, as each top answer will increase your chances of winning a Kindle Fire.
Each participant can only win 1 Kindle Fire. If fewer than 5 participants leave top answers by the deadline, then all second-top answerers will be entered into a random drawing for a Kindle Fire.
Question askers cannot enter the contest by accepting answers that they have left themselves.


Eligible contest questions can be found below.

Good luck!

The 2011 Community Moderator Election is now underway!

Community moderator elections have three phases:


Nomination phase
Primary phase
Election phase


Most elections take between two and three weeks, but this depends on how many candidates there are.

Please visit the official election page at

https://android.stackexchange.com/electionhttps://android.stackexchange.com/election

for more detail, and to participate!

If you have general questions about the election process, or questions for moderator candidates, feel free to ask them here on meta -- just make sure your questions are tagged /questions/tagged/electionelection.

That's not good.  We're looking into it.


















I am the author of an as-yet-unresolved question, https://android.stackexchange.com/q/158/102How can I prevent applications from running on startup? that has now become part of the https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/740/kindle-fire-contest-ready-goKindle Fire Contest.

I'll admit straight up - I'm not very active on this site. So I was a bit surprised when I saw 3 new answers to that question. I was even a little excited - for a very brief moment, until I actually read them.

My question was hardly complicated or unclear; its only notable characteristics were:


No mention of the underlying motivation (which was intentional, as there might be many different reasons to want to prevent auto-start); and
A request for solutions other than task-killers.


So it was rather annoying and depressing to find that all 3 new answers seemed to blatantly ignore or misrepresent the content of the question. Each new answer very pointedly (a) explicitly assumes that I am worrying about RAM and (b) leaves the advice not to kill tasks to save memory. Thanks for nothing, guys. I understand that maybe there is no good answer (with mobile devices, we're used to it) and would certainly upvote/accept a well-substantiated answer explaining why it can't be done, but I didn't even get that.

Afterward, I noticed the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kindle-fire-contestkindle-fire-contest tag on my question and read about the contest, and quickly realized why I was receiving these duplicated, half-assed cookie-cutter answers. To that point, I have some concerns about the way this contest is structured; what I definitely don't want (for me, or for this site) is a bunch of low-quality non-answers posted by people who just registered for the contest and don't really understand our philosophy or expectations here on Stack Exchange - in particular, the expectation to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-answeranswer the question.

So to get to my point, and I apologize for the long-winded nature of this post:  I don't think that this contest should be open to anyone and everyone. That turns this contest into more of a sweepstakes where people are encouraged to shoot from the hip. A major contest like this should be rewarding active contributors, not bounty hunters. In other words, it should have been/should be limited to users with at least some history of participation on the site, probably in the form of minimum reputation.

No entry requirement encourages people to answer only the contest questions (often sloppily), and quite possibly fade back into obscurity after the contest is done. A minimum rep requirement would force new or casual users (like me) to contribute properly for at least a few days in order to be eligible, increasing the chance of retention and benefiting the site more even if they don't stick around.

I would propose a minimum 200-rep eligibility criteria and a 2-3 week contest duration instead of 1 week. That would give people who are truly worthy of the prize plenty of time to make themselves eligible if they aren't already. If 200 rep, which is just 20 upvotes (10 for associated accounts) seems like too much effort for them, then there's no way we want to reward them for their apathy.

Any thoughts? Do others agree that the incentive structure here is a bit unbalanced? Would a minimum reputation help or are there better ways to control for the unintended consequences?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the Kindle Fire contest be a little more restrictive?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not my show. I'd ask that you (and everybody else) downvote, with extreme prejudice, any unhelpful "answers". Comments to the authors of said answers (civil, of course) would be good, too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett: That I do, and I try to be civil as well, although the frustration becomes more palpable with each successive answer saying the exact same thing. Downvoting may help (debatable with 1-rep users), but in any case it is treating the symptoms rather than the cause.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Heh. I ran out of votes yesterday and they won't refresh for another 10 hours.


















I share your concerns.  I've been deleting non-answers on all the questions — most of which have been flagged — but Al has undeleted some.  I haven't heard from him yet but I would assume he's trying to offer the benefit of the doubt and give everyone a chance at the contest.

I totally understand that point of view, but I am really uncomfortable with flooding you and the other OPs with crap.  Not to mention that everyone who sees these questions (a significant number due to the contest) will see the crap and either follow suit or think this site is full of crap.  https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/741/can-the-tag-for-the-kindle-fire-contest-be-made-a-mod-only-tagOne OP has withdrawn his question.  There are a couple others where the OP is clearly not going to come back and the issue is pretty localized, so the new answers are extra-useless.

SE isn't built for contests and promotions, and it shows.  https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kindle-fire-contestkindle-fire-contest is a http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/"meta tag", and meta tags are thoroughly reviled and discouraged throughout the network.  I don't think using one so visibly is a good idea, even though it attracts much more participation than a meta post does.  (https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3236/gaming-grant-round-10-week-of-november-15th#comment-8639Gaming has had this low-participating problem with their grants.)

Nor is repeatedly abusing the system message function every time we have a contest a good idea.  Android has a lot of hit-and-run users already, and I'd argue that these contests don't do anything to change that behavior without a rep/activity requirement as you mention.  And we certainly don't want to drive away users with annoyances.

One option is to protect all the questions involved, but that cuts out involvement without necessarily cutting out all the noise.  (Some are being auto-protected by Community, though, so should we un-protect those repeatedly?  Ugh.)  The other problem is that we can't really change the contest now that it's started without some trouble.  Personally I'd lean towards that anyways, if not terminating it, given the trouble we're already having.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I very much agree with the sentiment you've expressed here. I'm also noticing a trend of essentially duplicated answers which barely (or don't) provide much of an answer ([here](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/14934/marketplace-offers-downloads-in-notifications-but-when-i-tap-notification-none-a/16252#16252), for example...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with the concern about changing a contest that's already started; it is a little unfair, no matter how poor some of the results have been. Certainly something to keep in mind for next time at least (and for any future contests on any other sites).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Bad answers are different than non-answers. The former should be downvoted. Only the latter should be deleted and only if they're unsalvageable nonsense.


















@Aaronaugh & @MatthewRead, you both make very valid points and I appreciate the input - this coming from the guy who organized this contest, perhaps a bit too hastily.

But yes, this monster is already underway, and https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/691/what-older-unanswered-questions-are-still-relevant-todaythere https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/700/unanswered-questions-please-votewas https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/686/a-kindle-fire-giveaway-lets-discussample, if underpromoted, opportunity to chime in about the design of the contest. Clearly there are shortcomings to this model of outreach (this is an outreach effort, not a community reward campaign, though mods, too are eligible to win a Kindle Fire) and maybe it wasn't clear what the shortcomings for this format were until now.

So it's a learning experience, and we'll take these lessons (especially, perhaps, the 'meta tag problems,' which appear to elicit particular rage among community leaders) with us into the next campaign.

For the time being though, let's power through this contest. Hopefully out of the sea of crap, we will find gems, and in doing so improve Android knowledge available on the Internet.

The subject and the particular questions, yes, but all that was mentioned about the workings of the contest was that you'd consider offering bounties.  The tag and the entry requirements weren't known till the contest started.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead - I should have been more clear. I didn't see a need for the meta tag initially, but found use for it while writing up the official contest post as I wanted a dynamic list - denoting what's been answered & whats not - of all questions involved in the contest. I didn't see a problem with requesting this tag, but I was perhaps uninformed about the hate for meta tags here. Now I know. Still, I think the utility of the temporary tag (not to mention I've promoted the tag URL) trumps the hate. Though I'll be careful to stay away from them in the future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's certainly very useful, it's attracted a lot of attention. The problem is the side effects.  I'd be more worried about [Jeff's hate of meta tags](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/a/3304/6066) than ours, personally :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Of course, and no finger-pointing here; even if you'd been very explicit about the design, who knows if foresight would have been the same as hindsight; it's the Law of Unintended Consequences at work. Question is, now that we know, what can we do? Maybe not much...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead - as for the entry requirement, by default I'm always of the mindset that there should be very little barrier to entry when it comes to contributing on the site and/or participating in a contest designed at outreach. Clearly this creates some problems, but gets some new eyeballs on us 2. I probably should have been more clear in the meta post about whether there should be a rep req to participate, and maybe should have been more clear about the contest in general. But it's unrealistic to crowdsource the whole thing. At some point I have to make a judgement call + pull the trigger.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Aaronaught - In Re: What can we do? I'm writing an email to all users who have questions involved in the contest requesting they up/downvote good/bad answers & mark correct any correct answer. Hopefully this goes some distance in promoting positive behavior on the site and maybe eliminates some of the opportunity to leave unhelpful answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Understood.  I know the site promotion thing is by necessity a learn-on-the-fly sort of deal.  It would be nice if the devs could come up with a system to make promotions easier so we don't have to abuse things that were never meant for this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am sure the tag will not live long past the end of the contest. In fact, I guarantee it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As the contest is now over and [the winners announced](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/740/kindle-fire-contest-winners-announced) I have removed that tag from all the questions (and added links to them in the announcement instead). The empty tag will be removed by the system automatically in a couple of days.



















  I don't think that this contest should be open to anyone and everyone.
  ... it should have been/should be limited to users with at least some history
  of participation on the site.


Noooo. Contests are here to attract and recruit new users. The problem comes from the general concept of the contest. IMHO most "kindle-fire" questions didn't produce good answers because there are none/no solutions (yet) and therefore produce only low quality answers. The majority of questions won't benefit from the contest.

Therefore I think that the best contest rules are like "get 200 (or XXX) rep within 2 (3, 4) weeks (minus the 100 rep bonus) to be eligible for a prize". SX's downvote and close system will make sure that the answers and questions, that are produced in order to get the rep, are of good quality. This also encourages user not only to ask good questions and provide good answers, they could also get the rep by making valuable edits and providing good tag descriptions. After the contest, the site will have a few more >200 rep users, which will later be equipped with more and more permissions and privileges, helping to moderate the site. Everybody wins.

BTW: If the SX network want's to make regular contest for promotion (which is a good idea) don't abuse the tag system. Provide the appropriate tools instead.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like this idea.  This way anyone can participate (new or old users).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That seems reasonable too. Anything that encourages *ongoing* participation as opposed to bounty-hunting would be ideal. I also agree about the tag abuse (hell, I practically invented the classification of meta-tags) but that being said, I didn't want to nitpick about the mechanism when the much larger/more important issue is one of incentives.

What in the Wide, Wide World of Sports is Going On Here?

TL;DR -- put images and links in the answers. If they get voted up enough, they will appear on the main site as community promotion ads.

But whyyyyyyy?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting Android apps
the site's twitter account
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. And to click on it for great justice!

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 220 x 250 pixels
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs

Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/748here.

You might find it appropriate to note in a comment that you are the creator of the app, of course. The real main restrictions come from being on Meta (which thus restricts this to real participants of the community, rather than any ol' agendapusher) and of course the need for community approval by votes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we need a new one.

In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Town Hall Chat session with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.  I am working with the candidates to find a time that allows the most participation.

The Town Hall Chat will take place Wednesday the 7th at 01:00 UTC -  This is Tuesday 8pm EST.

Here are the details so far:


I would like to schedule this towards the beginning of the final election phase.  This means that I am looking at the 5th-7th. As soon as I coordinate with the existing moderators and candidates to find a best fit based on availability, I will edit this post with details on the "when".
The Town Hall Chat will be a one-hour event using our http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&sort=active&host=android.stackexchange.comchat platform.  I will update this post with a direct link to the chat room once the event is scheduled.
The format will be an open discussion.  Users are encouraged to pose questions to the candidates regarding their thoughts on moderation.
After the chat session, a digest of the event will be permanently linked here.

Not sure there. It seems to me that you can talk about one without talking about the other. Can you offer some sample questions where one could be used instead of the other?

I expect that there are probably a bunch of questions that are mis-tagged as one instead of the other, but that doesn't necessarily make them synonyms.

I don't feel strongly either way, though, so I can be convinced.

I always find it irritating that questions marked as duplicate show up as closed in the overview. Of course these questions are closed, but they are not closed because they are off-topic or because they have a poor quality. That's why they should be distinguishable from other closed questions by displaying [duplicate].

I'd like to point out the good arguments from Kate Gregory


  But when you look at a lower-volume site with a lot of closing (eg
  programmers.se) the [closed] markers are telling what's welcome here
  and what's not. When things are closed as dupes they look unwelcome,
  which they're not. I think the "first impression" is better when dupes
  are marked as such.

As http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2585779/android-historythis article explains, Android's visual identity has moved from the Droid Sans font to the Roboto font as of Android 4.0. However, the licensing for the font is unclear (to me) and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotothe Wikipedia article doesn't seem to shine light on this matter.

Can this site use Roboto in place of Droid Sans? Should it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Roboto is the new Droidb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Android is customizable. Perhaps useres here should be able to choose which font they see.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@gary The mobile site could potentially take advantage of the user agent and choose the matching font by default.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead that would be cool (even if it's subtle)


















We did something similar on https://philosophy.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291/its-aristotle-weekPhilosophy, where we designate one philosopher each week, and each person who asks a question relating to that philosopher will be eligible to win a prize. It's gotten a positive response so far, and we could easily adapt the model for this site - that is, designate a topic each week, and everyone who asks a question about it that week is entered into a drawing to win prizes. 

We could start with questions about the new operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich, then move on app week, tablet week, etc. 

What do you think? If you have suggestions for other weekly topics, please leave them here as well!

[Edit] It seems like there is a positive response to this idea, so we'll go ahead with it starting Monday 12/19. I'll make another meta post announcing the official rules then. In the meantime, keep thinking of other ideas for future weekly topics!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would you be interested in Ice Cream Sandwich week?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That sounds like a cool idea.  Seems like it would be an easier contest to manage as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like this idea. I don't think it'll cause too  many (or as many) "I'm posting *something* just to get my name in the hat"


















I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too.

One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like "Why is ICS so AWESOME!" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question).

(I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There will not be any score requirements (to avoid troublesome problem of sock puppet voting/inflation). This contest will not be broadcast externally as well to avoid bad/noob questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd expect a minimum score (0?) and the question not being closed would be part of this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett Yes, should be 0+ and non-closed (not to contradict myself, but some standard minimum).


















What benefit does the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/devicesdevices tag provide? It seems really vague and unnecessary in almost every possible circumstance. The only question that seems to even remotely use it in a reasonable manner is https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/11548/list-of-gpl-compliant-android-deviceshttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/11548/list-of-gpl-compliant-android-devices, but I'd argue that could be closed as "Not Constructive" or "Too Localized" anyway.

Am I missing a use-case here, or does this tag deserve to be burninated?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why does the "devices" tag exist?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This brought to my attention a whole ton of other terrible tags as well, so thanks :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: Ha, sure thing.

It looked like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/serviceservice was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with "phone service".  I replaced it with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/connectivityconnectivity in most places, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/servicesservices where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/serviceservice die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/phone-servicephone-service or something clearer.

Swapping "service" for "connectivity" where appropriate was a better idea than merging them, though. I like.


















I don't know who or when, but https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/haptic-feedbackhaptic-feedback is currently a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vibrationvibration.

Now, while haptic feedback is a vibration, it is quite separate and distinct from notification vibrations. (The lack of a tag wiki certainly doesn't help.) I don't think they should be synonyms. In fact, "vibration" should probably be https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/notification-vibrationnotification-vibration or similar.

Does anyone have a good argument for why these should stay synonyms? (Yes, I know it'll take touching every single question with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vibrationvibration to fix. I'm willing to do it.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5De-synonymize vibration, haptic-feedbackb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5turning vibration into notification-vibration is a good idea


















This week, we’re kicking off a “Topic of the Week” series.

How it works: We will designate one topic each week, and each person who asks a question relating to that topic will be eligible to win a prize.

How to enter: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/askAsk a question relating to the topic of the week, and tag it accordingly (this week, use the "4.0-ice-cream-sandwich" tag - see example questions https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4.0-ice-cream-sandwichhere). Each question you ask will get you one entry into a random drawing to win an Android accessory of your choice (under $50). Or $50 worth of ice cream sandwiches. 

Choosing the topic of the week: For this first week, we decided to go with the newest Android operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich (see the discussion https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/772/would-you-be-interested-in-ice-cream-sandwich-weekhere). But for all following weeks we want to take suggestions from you! Leave your suggestion as an answer to this meta post, and the topic that is voted the highest at the end of each round will be the topic of the following week.

Each round will be announced Monday morning at approximately 10 am EST.

[Edit] Ice Cream Sandwich week is now over and was followed by https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/784/its-tablet-weekTablet Week. Congratulations to Anders for winning ICS week!

...because that's what they are.

Granted, there's not a "store" but it's the same idea as "where can I get the cheapest Android phone". 

If nothing else, it's someone trying to crowdsource their web search.

That said, a canonical "where can I find Android ROMs" question (Community Wiki) would be a good idea.1

Still and all, I'd be inclined to let that question stand if they also include information about what ROMs they've already checked out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Makes sense, thanks.


















Sounds good to me, and I agree that individual requests are basically shopping recs.  I went ahead and created the question: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/17152/where-can-i-find-stock-or-custom-roms-for-my-android-device/17153#17153Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?

Earlier this week, we kicked off a "Topic of the Week" series, and this week is tablet week!

How it works: Each person who asks a question about an Android tablet will be entered into a drawing to win a prize.

How to enter: Ask a question about any Android tablet and tag it https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tablettablet (along with any other appropriate tags - feel free to use a tag for the specific tablet as long as you also use the "tablet" tag). Each question you ask will get you one entry into a random drawing to win Android accessories (your choice up to $100). 

Dates: Tablet week begins now and will end Monday January 2nd at 10 am EST. We are announcing this contest a few days early because of the holidays this weekend. 

Edit: Tablet week is now over. Congratulations to Padma Kumar for winning!

I think its a good idea but should be announced in the forum somehow.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lauren Thanks a lot...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5yes, I got the gift that you ordered. but only less than 50 $ instead of 100 $.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That was my mistake, we recently bumped up the prize from $50 to $100 and I forgot when I notified you. I already emailed you about it, feel free to select an additional prize.


















I have added "Roboto" to the font stack for the site(both main and Meta).

For now I'm not using it as a web font like I did with Droid Sans, since I'm not too clear on the re-distribution licensing. 

Roboto should show up on handheld after the next production build. Meanwhile if you want to see it on your desktop, you can http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/robotodownload the font manually.

Personally I think it looks a lot better than Droid Sans. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hichris123 we have been using Roboto as a web font though. do you not see it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Now I do, but previously it was rendering as Droid Sans on Windows.


















I just tried to join this forum while using Chrome, my default browser for now.  I've gone through my settings and there is nothing blocking cookie usage.  I've been logging in to other SE sites with no trouble, including a few within the last 30 minutes or so.

But when I tried logging on to here for the first time, using OpenID, first I got a page saying, "This account is detected in 8 other StackExchange sites.  Use this information?" when I clicked the "Create account" button, I got a one line text only message on an otherwise blank page telling me to enable cookies.

I got this several times and each time checked my preferences, but they're set to allow cookies.

So I tried it with Firefox and it worked -- which is strange, since I have tighter security settings on Firefox than on Chrome.

Once I closed Firefox and then clicked "log in" (at the top of any page here), I had no problem with my account being recognized.

Then I turned off any extension that wasn't site specific or that dealt with cookies and still got that problem.

Edit: The changes have been implemented. Individual device rooting questions are encouraged, though we want answers to be complete -- covering all Android versions.  The big rooting question now indexes the individual questions.



http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25/conversation/re-visiting-rooting-questionsRecently in chat it was mentioned that our Community Wiki question, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-deviceHow do I root my Android device?, doesn't quite work.  I had been thinking this myself recently and I think it's time we brought it up here on Meta.

The crux of the matter seems to be two points:


Forum posts are incomplete, badly written, and sometimes just plain wrong.  We can do better than just link to them.
Rooting methods often vary from version to version.  At minimum, we need more than one entry for many of the devices and a way to classify them.


Solving these problems via the current post would require adding a lot more information to the post.  Even if we didn't include our own rooting guide, we'd still need to add versions numbers, explanations, and so on.  The post would become massive.

Given this, I think it's best that we create one post per device.  These questions should each have one answer with a complete rooting guide that addresses all software versions, referencing forum posts if applicable but not relying on their existence or quality.  We can create posts for highly-anticipated devices on release (to grab the traffic) and wait for questions to actually be asked about others, to avoid cluttering the site with every guide on the planet.

The current question could continue in its current form, changing the index to link to our questions instead of externally.  The general tips and list of rooting tools that work on many devices is certainly useful.

Side benefits include searchability (the question "How do I root my device?" is less likely to match the search "How can I root my Kindle Fire?" than a question titled the same as the search) and hopefully drawing some (constructive) users here from XDA and the other forums.

Should we do this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we revisit our "How do I root X?" policy?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How would you handle cases where a number of phones can be rooted the same way?  E.g., HTC phones and http://unrevoked.com/.  In general, I think it would be a good idea, but would require quite a bit of time and expertise for each phoneb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BryanDenny It doesn't work for all versions, at least not without downgrading, from what I hear.  That said a "How can I root with Unrevoked?" question might be useful too depending on the particulars, and device-specific questions can link to it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll be honest, I think the consolidated question is and always was a bad solution. As a generic fall back with generic info it's okay, but we should not close or discourage "how do I root X exact device?" questions because that's how people search, and the generic question is extremely unwieldy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The all-devices question is a horrible pile of outdated and uncommented random links. Please just close it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lohoris The general tips are useful, I'd rather see the pile of links replaced with links to our individual rooting questions.  It's CW, so feel free to edit in improvements.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As to the question of @BryanDenny I'd suggest we should at least tag them in a recognizable way then, i.e. make sure the tags "rooting" plus the device-tag (e.g. "sony-xperia-x10") should be present. Otherwise it will get harder with the time to track the "real duplicates" here with the increasing number of questions.


















One post per device for rooting questions is OK. Don't even make them CW, this only prevents people from answering because they don't get any reputation. They will automatically become CW when it's time for it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New users often hit these questions and I'd rather err on the side of letting them add info instead of catering to those just in it for the rep.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't expect that someone adds some information when he is also too "lazy" to register. On the other hand, the strive for rep motivates users to add quality content to the site. That outweighs your argument in my eyes.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You seem to be arguing against having any CW posts.  They're supposed to be made intentionally; the automatic conversion happens when the mass editing indicates it *should* have been done earlier, not "when it's time".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On second thought, given Bryan's comment I think you might be right here.  It will require a lot of effort to put these answers together, so rep rewards make sense, and having a ton of CW questions is discouraged anyways.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed, giving rep for these answer would be a great motivator.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And it would be less of a "wiki" of compiled information like it is now and more of a Q&A as it is geared to one specific deviceb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead Community wiki is no longer used just to allow new users to edit posts, [see here](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/). Users of any rep can suggest edits. Rep rewards are encouraged and lots of people have questions about rooting; may as well encourage those people with rewards.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BenBrocka Yes, the form of the desired answers (complete guides) is what I think would make them good CW candidates. One of Grace's comments on that blog post: "Unchecked, this kind of question could gather everyone’s home remedies, and then some. As community wiki, it encourages people to contribute by adding to the existing content, with a small benefit of also discouraging unwarranted and low quality posts." That said, all you guys's points stand :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead that's why Jeff suggests community wiki for answers not questions. Plus the autoCW does that for us if necessary. IF one guy really does make a complete guide with no editing needed IMO he deserves the rep, and we don't need CW to make it easier to edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5with tools like SuperOneClick, which can root almost any device, it becomes multiple questions, all with the same answer of "use superoneclick.


















I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game.

That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy.

I think "How do I root device X" or, even better, "How do I root Y class of devices" is a good way to go.

I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY "how do I root device X with method Y" questions.

I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward.

We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would say that each "method" could be a different answer to the question, if it ever comes to that (so a generic device question with specific answers).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, I like that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Most people seem to search "how do I root droid x" and want instructions for their specific device rather than searching "how do I root android" and picking through the onslaught of generic advice. We should tailor our questions and answers to devices.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm against one answer per method.  Some devices will get a ton of answers and voting won't make sense -- did a lot of people have that software version, or is the method simpler, or more reliable, or terrible but just better written?  This is again why I think they should be CW-style if not actually marked CW:b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Unchecked, this kind of question could gather everyone’s home remedies, and then some. As community wiki, it encourages people to contribute by adding to the existing content, with a small benefit of also discouraging unwarranted and low quality posts" per [Grace](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/).


















Specifically I want an app that does what https://market.android.com/details?id=com.citc.wallet&hl=enPocket does that I can use on Android and iOS without using a web app. 

Would such a question be on topic here and or Ask Different? If so, which site is more appropriate?

More generally, is it okay to ask how one could perform a task in a cross platform manner (including Android) on topic? Is it only on topic if I'm asking how to do the Android part of the task?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I want an app that does X and works on both Android and iOS. Can I ask that here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's your reason for requiring that the app have a version for both platforms?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It securely syncs encrypted personal information like passwords via drop box. I'd like to be able to access the information on both devices on a single serviceb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And to pre-empt you asking the question, I've used SplashID for years as a cross-platform password/info storage app across Palm, Android, Blackberry and PCs. They have an iOS version (note paid app though). http://splashdata.com/splashid/ it uses a PC/Mac as the sync hub over wifi, and can backup to Dropbox etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note: cross-posting within Stack Exchange is _okay_ so long as what you're asking is tailored to the particular site you're asking on (no simple copy-and-paste, please). It's a good idea to indicate you're cross-posting and to link to the other question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn ouch, $10 apiece. I'm not a cheapskate but since I need to get such an app *twice* I was hoping for a free or cheap solution. Pocket's free and I'm kind of amazed it's not on iOS. I wish Springpad had a secure data section or something.


















I'd say it's fine.  Wanting your services consolidated is a perfectly OK criterion for potential solutions, as is not using a web app.

Things to note:


"Is there an app" is discouraged; you'll get better answers with "How can I" anyways, even if you know they'll all mention apps.
We can't help you if you want us to provide info on how well the iOS version works and that sort of thing. Which is not to say users can't tell you, but rather that you shouldn't ask for or expect it.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a reason for the anti-app question policy btw? Even if it's not the only way to solve a problem it's how most smartphone users are used to framing problems, and it's probably reflected heavily in search terms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BenBrocka "Is there an app" type questions tend to encourage a deluge of one-liner answers with every conceivable related app posted by different people, these are known as "shopping recommendation" questions are dislallowed in the [FAQ](http://android.stackexchange.com/faq#what-about-other-android-related-questions). "How do I do X" questions tend to encourage posts with well thought out solutions to the problem that may or may not include an app, and if so are more likely to give the pros and cons of the choices, and be more helpful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn true. There might be dozens of apps to securely sync data (there are) but there are only specific ways I can keep that info in sync across iOS and Android.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think at least in the case of app recommendations, we're OK with losing out on search traffic. Unless the powers that be at SE change their stance on those sort of questions :P


















Suggested "X week!" topic:

HTC, Samsung, Motorola, LG, etc.: give each OEM some of the limelight, maybe a week when they release a new device. But all devices from that OEM would be part of the contest.

Today I saw this banner on StackOverflow



I had to make a huge mental effort just to get that the gray portal that holds the question text is in fact an Android device. The reason is it has proportions of an iPad-like tab - - very close to a square - but most Android devices are smartphones and smartphones have slightly different proportions - less square. Also the gray portal completely lacks Android-specific hardware buttons that make Android devices distinguishable from say mobile Windows devices (the latter have different buttons).

IMO the banner needs improvements. My suggestions would be the following (I myself lack drawing capabilities):


make the thing more elongated (less square) - something like HTC Incredible S proportions
add margins on the "top" and the "bottom" (if held in portrait orientation) as real smartphones usually have
add hardware buttons
change orientation to landscape so that there's more room for the text
bring the "Android Enthusiasts" caption out of the device image - place it beneath

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Android device" barely recognizable on bannersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it meant to be an Android device? I always thought they were just holding up a noticeboard, other sites have a similar board with their sites logo in the corner for promotions? Also, hardware buttons are the way of the past!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not to mention that it seems every OEM had their own ideas about the order of those hardware buttons.


















I made https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome-to-phonegoogle-chrome-to-phone the master to be consistent with our other tags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Meh. That's an awfully long tag, and it's not like "Chrome to Phone" needs to be disambiguated.


















https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aospaosp seems to me to be a subset of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-sourceandroid-source.  For example, this question doesn't fit under https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aospaosp : https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/17108/webpage-with-amazon-kindle-source-code-summary-of-changeshttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/17108/webpage-with-amazon-kindle-source-code-summary-of-changes

That said, I do see the problem with it being used for dev questions.  For now I've removed it from those questions (and also deleted a bunch of old dev questions).

Update: I've removed both tags from all questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I went back and forth on that one, too, but part of me thinks that question is something of an anomaly WRT the tags we currently have. I'll also admit that I've always thought `[android-source]` was just not a very useful tag, though. Even on that question I'm tempted to just remove it and leave the KF tag as the only one, since it's not *really* about the Android source code in a general sense - it's about the KF's source code.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis That's a fair point. Let's see if anyone else has thoughts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've removed [android-source] from a few totally irrelevant questions that only had that tag this week, it does seem like it's being used simply because "Android" auto-completes to it, and people can't be bothered to think of any other tags to use. Would say it either needs to go, or be a synonym of [aosp]. Left on its own it's just too much of a tempatation for lazy taggersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, by itself, [tag:android-source] isn't very useful. If it stays it should be renamed [tag:android-source-code].


















It's not supposed to be a tablet. It's just a notice panel, like the one used on this site's header. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, then I guess the major reason why I thought it was a tablet is the background color that looks more or less as a shut off scree. Perhaps changing the color would address that ambiguity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sharptooth Could be showing my age here, but it looks like a blackboard/chalkboard to me rather than a shut off screen. Why would you have writing on an off screen?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn: I'm old enough to remember chalkboards - it's very unusual to see typeset captions on them and they never have any specific color - rather they are all in chalk traces.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@sharptooth: tablets doesn't have semi-transparent/translucent borders, and they shouldn't look flat like that.


















I'm a moderator on software quality assurance (sqa.stackexchange) and we had a post that came to the board over there.

Would this be something that's on topic for this site? Or would it just get closed anyway... If it's just going to be closed, I'll save you the trouble and close it on sqa. But if it's going to contribute to the community here, I'll migrate it over.

Definitely not. That's a programming question, and programming questions go on Stack Overflow.

How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis?

This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases.

It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc.

Looking here:

https://android.stackexchange.com/admin/posts/migrated/awayhttps://android.stackexchange.com/admin/posts/migrated/away

I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would agree that it might not be worth the effort at this point, more just something to think about.  Perhaps in the future it would be generalizable, with migrations from Music to SO having `music` added for example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: I **guess** the problem is implementing it once. Once it's there and it works, enabling it for every site would be trivial.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@matthew it's possible for the future, of course, but right now I don't see a pressing problem


















We definitely can't reproduce this.

Did you try disabling any Chrome extensions you are using? Did you modify any of the default browser settings?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5At this point, I can't duplicate it either, so I guess there's not much to do.  If it comes up again, I'll see if I can find out what conditions are causing it.


















I'm wondering how much this site is really active.

Of 5 questions I asked, 3 received no answer at all. That's a pretty high number, I've never encountered anything like that on any SE site so far.

Sure, it might be just chance, but still I think it was worth to ask here. 

(looking at the main page, there's a whole lot of unanswered posts too, so I guess it's not only me)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this site active? (sorry for asking)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't mean any offence by this, but you've asked 5 questions and not answered anyone else's questions at all. To get answers to questions we need people to answer questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn: while this is technically true, you have to know the answers to give them. I help where I can, I search for help where I need. Looks like this SE only intersects the latter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Additionally according to the [site directory](http://stackexchange.com/sites), we currently have 85% questions answered, while Stack Overflow has 81% of questions answered. We're in roughly the bottom quarter of SE sites for answered questions, but we're not at the bottom and the "original trilogy" are all below us (notably Apple which has the most similar remit to us is right beside us in the listings).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn: this covers the whole site history, which is irrelevant since I'm talking about *now*. Currently in front page 12/48 questions are unanswered (25%), and when I asked this question IIRC they were even more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The front page isn't a good metric for any site, you need to give people time to answer.  It fluctuates constantly and is heavily dependent on the time of day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: oh, true, you're right. Well, nevermind, I was already convinced with your answer anyway :)


















I think as long as it's clear you're good to do whatever you want.  Like GAThrawn I would leave the keyboard buttons for actual buttons, though I tend to use bold or nothing for them myself.  I also tend to use inline code for menu items.

I suppose in an ideal world we would have a standard, or perhaps site-specific ways to indicate various Android UI elements, but I don't think it's particularly important.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, I know it's not particularly important, but I like to have a unified formatting style. Maybe I'll stick with inline code.


















What should we do with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/12478/is-there-a-gis-application-for-androidhttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/12478/is-there-a-gis-application-for-android? The question is equally on-topic for both Android and GIS Stack Exchange.

As it stands now, the question cannot be answered without duplicating GIS' perfectly good answer and there is no appropriate close/duplicate reason for this kind if case.


















It's a pity that StackExchange isn't a bit more intelligent with cross-SE site links. I'd say that the questions are related, but there's likely to be a slightly different focus by answerers on each site. I'd have thought an entry in the "Linked Questions" section would be the right way to do it, but not currently possible.

In general it's fine to have overlapping questions, as long as they weren't cross-posted by the same user (without appropriate reason).  Linking in a comment is a good idea though.

This isn't generally done on beta sites though (the beta question is closed), although you'd have to ask the SE team for the reasoning there.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please see my added comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LieRyan I still think it's fine to stay here. An answer pointing to GIS and summarizing wouldn't be amiss though. If you think SE should have a better way of dealing with these I would bring it up on MSO, since it's likely to get more attention there (if it hasn't already been discussed).


















I think this depends largely on the context of the questions. In general, duplicate questions are not deleted unless they are really, truly, exact duplicates down to the wording. Instead, duplicates with different phrasings or details are closed (but not deleted!) and linked to act as "sign posts" to original or more established questions.

Even if the new one is more heavily up-voted, it may still be closed if the older one contains more information or very useful answers. It's also possible for moderators to merge questions, but I'm not sure entirely how that plays out.

Really though, I don't think there's quite a hard-and-fast rule about how votes are considered when flagging duplicates, but rather content. If the content of the new one is better than the old one, then the old one may be closed as a dupe of the new one (and vice versa). This is sometimes the case with questions where the original is somewhat narrowly focused, but a more generally applicable question is asked that would benefit a larger audience. In that case it may make sense to close the older, narrower question as a duplicate of a more "canonical" one. If the content is very similar, I think it generally makes sense to simply close the new one to point it to the old one.

This is just my observational $0.02 on the matter, and I think that evaluating duplicates by content makes the most sense.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed.  As for merging, we generally do it for the down-to-the-word duplicates you mention if both have good answers we don't want to be lost.


















Sure, simply enter [tag] as search option. It's also stated https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=here.

For example, if you want to search for all questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsung-galaxy-ssamsung-galaxy-s, you would enter [samsung-galaxy-s] in the search field: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsung-galaxy-sResult

In addition to the search filtering that Flow mentions, you can also set up "favorite" and "ignored" tags from the right sidebar on https://android.stackexchange.com/the main page. Ignored tags will be faded grey on the question lists and favorited ones will be highlighted.

It was tried, sort of.  There used to be something called Flag Weight that was similar to reputation, and some users enjoyed the "game" of trying to increase it.  It had some problems, though — it punished good flaggers disproportionately for mistakes, and complaints about rejected flags were constant.  There's still a count of helpful flags on your profile page though, and there are badges for flagging (e.g., https://android.stackexchange.com/badges/74/marshalMarshal).

IMO we don't have a problem with not enough flags, so encouraging it further is unnecessary given the potential downsides.

I just saw that the badge name only has one 'L' so I assumed it was a typo. Usually I'm better with those kinds of things since I actually favour UK spellings on many words, but "Marshall" would be a new one to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Hmm, looking it up it appears to be a minor variant.

I tried to look at my flagging history as I can at Stack Overflow through the "helpful flags" link in the profile, but I couldn't find one. I *can* see my flagging history by directly browsing to `http://android.stackexchange.com/users/flag-summary/`, but the link in from the profile seems to be missing. (At SO it's right under "profile views", but I couldn't find it anywhere else in my android.se profile either.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AdiInbar It shows for me on my profile here.  Maybe it's only shown after a certain number of flags?


















I'd just add to Al's answer that if the tag is inappropriate but not spam or offensive — e.g., something off-topic like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/marketingmarketing — it may be better to make a post here on Meta and see what people think.  Marketing might be obviously off-topic, but often it's less clear and there might be several alternative actions to discuss.  See the questions here tagged /questions/tagged/tagstags to get a better idea of this.

While writing comments as a reply to particular user, when i press @ followed by 1st letter of user's name i get an Auto-Complete box suggesting the user's name. It is a very useful feature.

Allow me to preface this with a bit of a disclaimer. I do not want to sound ungrateful or upset with the efforts of the SE team to support and promote this site. I think it's fantastic that SE is willing to create little contests and promotions and such for its sites, and I'm genuinely appreciative of the support they provide to all of the sites in the network. I very much enjoy Android Enthusiasts, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

Now, having said that, I feel the need to voice a bit of concern over the specifics of some of our site promotions. This was motivated initially by what I felt was an almost immediate flood of low-quality questions in https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/audioaudio for the current contest, so I decided to go back and do a little bit of datamining on the previous ones. What concerns me is that although we may be getting attention from the contests, we are:


Generally not retaining the users we attract
Causing a larger-than-usual influx of poor questions
(In my view) Run the risk of possibly disillusioning some of the more regular and loyal members


Now that we've had a few goes at some contests, I think we can start to analyze the results a bit. I'm going to go through the past contests in what should essentially be chronological order with a bit of data I collected by simply scanning the relevant tags and user profiles:

https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/740/kindle-fire-contest-winners-announcedKindle Fire Contest

This contest in some ways worked and in some ways felt like it kind of didn't. On the one hand, it brought attention to a lot of older unanswered questions, which is generally great. On the other hand, one user was so annoyed by what he perceived to be a flood of non-answers grabbing for loot, that he actually https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/741/can-the-tag-for-the-kindle-fire-contest-be-made-a-mod-only-tag#comment1151_741removed the tag from his own question so that it would not be part of the contest. There were certainly lots of cases of non-answers or half-answers attempting to get in on the contest, which provided a lot of clutter that people ended up needing to downvote since the rules dictated that anything with a score of zero was an eligible entry. In my opinion, this doesn't really encourage quality participation, but that's probably neither here nor there.

The winners of the contest also show some concerning stats. Of the 5 winners:


2 have not visited the site since the end of the contest
1 has visited but has made no other contributions to the site


Additionally, this user has only one post total (mind you, this is the post which won the contest for them) and it currently sits at a net score of -1 (!!)



https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/781/its-ice-cream-sandwich-weekIce Cream Sandwich week

ICS week was the first tag-themed week. It was presented to the community on Meta before starting and received generally positive responses. Overall the week played out relatively well, but still seemed to encourage one-off posts to win sweet loot:


18 questions asked
1 of the 18 was closed
5 of the users (I count 14 total unique users, so ~35%) have no other activity on their profiles whatsoever
The winning question ultimately had the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4.0-ice-cream-sandwich4.0-ice-cream-sandwich removed (!!) - It was quite arguably never about ICS to begin with.


https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/784/its-tablet-weekTablet week

Tablet week started immediately after ICS week, and was not presented to the userbase as a whole beforehand. It was also not one of the tags suggested in the ICS week's answers. I found this to be a bit unusual as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tablettablet is a pretty broad tag, but it didn't seem like an unreasonable choice. This perhaps lent to the fact that there were very few entries (it's a bit of a low-traffic tag).


6 questions were asked (none closed)
1 user has no other posts on the site


https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/804/topic-of-the-week-its-apps-week-ask-and-win-prizes-now-closedApps week

I have to be blunt here: this was a terrible tag choice, in my opinion. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applicationsapplications is absolutely notorious for being a dumping ground for questions where the author can't come up with any other relevant tags. It's vague, it's broad, and it attracts junk and (I think) should be actively discouraged whenever possible. I firmly believe that if this tag had been pitched to the community via Meta it would have been met with substantial resistance. The stats for this week were:


18 questions asked
3 closed
7 users (out of 17) have no other activity outside of the contest or the contest timeframe


https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/834/its-audio-weekAudio week

Similar to tablet week, this seems like an unusual tag choice to me. It is very broad, and it is also fairly low traffic (111 posts as of this writing, which includes the sudden influx of contest questions). Additionally, this week is based purely on views, which seems to further fly in the face of promoting high-quality contributions. Realistically, a winning entry needs only to be acceptable with effective link distribution. Audio week has also not fared so well, in my opinion, as it currently has:


13 questions asked
5 of the 13 (this is ~38%) have been closed, one has 3 close votes
7 of the users have (so far) no other activity on the site


I don't claim to have any solutions, but I do think that perhaps we should at least discuss the contests that have been run so far. As a community, I'm curious to know:


How do we feel about these contests and this data? Are we concerned? Do we consider these contests successful?
What other contest styles could we look at? Are there other options?
Should we be concerned about the fact that established, loyal users have no benefit over one-off throwaway accounts in these contests (which, in many cases appear to never return)?
Should the eligible posts be moderated more stringently or held to a higher standard than simply "Not a negative score and not closed"? Are view-based contests a good idea?

Thanks for bringing this up for discussion and doing some data research.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's an obvious problem with how to gain retention from these contests. I'm not sure yet what to suggest we can do or change to improve it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Glad someone asked the question, was thinking of doing the same myself, after the shock of logging onto the site early on the first day of the Audio contest and seeing the sheer volume of clean-up needed. (one of the downsides of getting into work hours before most of the mods in later timezones get out of bed!) Had no idea there was a contest on at the time as I hadn't caught up on the news yet, but could tell there was definitely something up!


















Thanks for posting this; I agree fully.

Tags are tricky across all SE sites, but in my experience we do have somewhat unique problems with them here.  Gaming has had issues with meta tags that we haven't, for example, but on the other hand most of their tags are really easy to evaluate.  For example, their swtor tag is applied only to questions about The Old Republic and it's immediately obvious when a question should or shouldn't have the tag.  Few would try to get away with tagging a StarCraft question with it in order to cheat at a contest, since they would have no chance of getting away with it.

That's not as true here.  The closest we have to such specific tags are device tags, but they aren't supposed to be applied to every question involving the device.  We get an immense number of questions where no one has any idea whether the issue is device-specific or not; it could be part of Android, specific to a chipset, specific to a custom UI or launcher, etc.  Tags like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/audioaudio are even worse.  Does it cover call audio?  Notifications?  Music?  With many tags we've attempted to address the distinctions in tag wikis, but no one reads them.  It doesn't help that the contests provide no real advice on how the tag should be used (nor is that the right place for it, IMO).

I don't think promotions based on tags can work here.  Device tags are the best candidates, yet bad overall: in addition to it being hard to determine when they should be used, I can't see a situation in which it makes sense to select a device tag.  If the device is just being released, we won't get that many questions about it and anyone who already owns one probably wouldn't be too excited to win another.  If the device hasn't been released, we'll get speculation and bad questions about easily-Googled announcements.  If the device is old, no one will be interested.  This applies to the OS version tags as well, really.

The drive-by user problem is pervasive here, in more than just contests.  I think in order to combat this we need to have contests reward people for longer-term participation, so that they'll want to stay and be involved.  I don't know the best way to go about that, but I think draw entries might work.  Top user for the month?  Get entered into a draw for the end of the year, winner gets the device of their choice.  New user gaining 500+ rep in the first month?  Win a case or a headset or other peripheral.  Something like that.  Good questions and good answers will also draw more traffic and thus more users; I think it's better to entice users organically with content instead of overtly with short-term promotions.

As for moderation, I did moderate more strictly during the Kindle Fire Contest.  We had a few users being absolutely bombarded with crap and I was a bit liberal with deletions of bad and duplicate answers.  For these other contests I've moderated just as I always do, but I agree that the relevant questions are disproportionately bad. I haven't looked at exact stats but you're right that many are flagged, closed, and improperly tagged.  It's quite unpleasant to, effectively, tell someone that there were hidden terms to the contest (you have to use the tag appropriately, where appropriately is non-obviously defined) and their question doesn't qualify.  It's even worse to see someone post crap and win instead of someone who posted a great question.

I also strongly agree that the team needs to take advantage of the community here.  Grace Note, former Gaming mod and current SE employee, has helped with their promotions, but (as far as I can tell) there's no one even remotely as familiar with our site helping out with our promotions.  Not taking advantage of us just doesn't make sense; even if the promotions were going well, making them better wouldn't hurt.

As an aside, I hate https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tablettablet with a passion and have been trying to figure out how to get rid of it.  It's no better than if we had https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/phonephone.



Rather than make a novel in the comments I'm going to here respond to Lauren's comment:


  I agree with most of your points here. Unfortunately, we don't have a Grace Note equivalent for the Android community. That's why we've made an effort to stay in contact with the moderators by posting on meta and via email. I know we've involved you personally in an email about upcoming promotions, and I'm always happy to talk to anyone who has ideas or feedback. Hopefully this thread will help us all talk and come up with a good solution.


Much of it has felt like a formality. The ICS contest you contacted us about was probably the least problematic, though certainly scaled back from the initial idea and (I think) correspondingly less successful.  I think we'd all have benefitted from a bit more back-and-forth between the "hey there might be a thing" and "contest starts NOW!" communications.

By no means do I expect to be included or privy to what you're doing at SE; my job is just to moderate.  What's really uncomfortable for me is being included just enough that I do have to acknowledge it, and at the same time knowing that if I had ever been asked about https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/audioaudio I would have been vehement in advising you against it.  I'm left explaining it after the fact in a wall of text on Meta, which no doubt feels like an attack on you to some degree, for which I apologize.  I don't doubt your intentions or abilities in any way; everyone I've ever been in contact with at SE has been awesome.

Right now I see two methods of dealing with the disjoint here:


Promotions are designed on Meta.  The team makes a post with an idea, the community gives feedback, the final form including complete rules and so on is determined before the contest ever starts.  At least until we figure out a formula that works.
Promotions are experiments.  The team comes up with ideas and doesn't involve us with them, just acknowledging that things are experimental and there may be issues.


I don't really like the latter because we have so few involved users; when they have so many bad posts to clean up it gets tiring and it sort of feels like being dumped on.  (This can be mitigated to some degree by contests that reward longer-term involvement.)  Finding what works here is obviously difficult and it seems that trial and error will inevitably result in more to clean up.

The former has its problems too — it's slow and probably awkward for you, it may remove the element of surprise, Meta isn't built for back-and-forth, etc.  Again I'm not sure what the best solution is here, but the current track doesn't seem to be working for anyone, and I think it's simply because, again, this stuff is hard.  I'd feel quite bad if anyone came away from this feeling that they were to blame, because I don't think that's the case.

I think I was subconsciously blocking it out because it was based on the `applications` tag (which I personally consider to be the One Great Scourge of this site, but I won't go into that...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis It's certainly not good for classifying anything, specific tags are better.  I may take a crack at it soon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with most of your points here. Unfortunately, we don't have a Grace Note equivalent for the Android community. That's why we've made an effort to stay in contact with the moderators by posting on meta and via email. I know we've involved you personally in an email about upcoming promotions, and I'm always happy to talk to anyone who has ideas or feedback. Hopefully this thread will help us all talk and come up with a good solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lauren Please see my update. As I allude to there I get the sense that I am not coming across well in text, and I'm sorry for that. I appreciate you participating & listening here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the update. From my point of view, I'd love to have more input when designing contests. But as you said, that would drag on, and it's awkward to do on Meta. We contacted you via email before because it seemed easier than Meta. It certainly wasn't meant to feel like a formality, we really did want your input. But maybe email isn't a good medium for discussions either. Maybe we could set up a time where the moderators and @Seth and I can chat about upcoming promotions. Could either be in our chat room or maybe on Skype or a Google hangout. What do you think?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lauren I'd certainly be interested in trying!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good. I'll shoot you an email later so we can figure out a time/method/etc.


















I definitely agree that these are valid concerns. One of our biggest challenges is finding promotions that have an effect. It seems like we've found ways to generate a temporary spike in questions, but that doesn't necessarily translate into users that stick around. Our theory was that if you generate enough spikes, there will be the occasional user that sticks around. I don't think there has been enough time or enough contests to determine whether or not that is true, but I do think that promoting the site through a contest is a good thing, because it makes the site more visible. In other words, it's definitely good to look at how active people are after they enter a contest as one metric, but contests can also attract new users after the fact because of the new content.

That being said, it is important to make sure our questions and answers remain high quality, and contests that promote asking bad questions are always bad. That's why we decided to go with views for Audio Week instead of a random drawing. We figured that votes were more easily inflated than views, and that better questions would be clicked on more. However, it might be worthwhile to place more emphasis on votes in the future. Perhaps holding questions to a standard of "at least a score of 3" (or 5, or something) would be a better.

I agree with @MatthewRead that increasing minimum score would be a good step. I actually voiced this concern [once before](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/772/would-you-be-interested-in-ice-cream-sandwich-week/773#773). I originally suggested a mere +1 score for questions to be eligible for the drawings and it was turned down by the contest organizer. Incidentally, is there really that much concern regarding "vote inflation" on contests? Is the concern with sockpuppets, or something else?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, the concern is with sock puppets. Just worried about people soliciting a ton of up-votes and bad questions having a high score. It seems to me that it's easier to do that than to artificially inflate your views, but maybe that's not actually true.


















It seems like the background color on the name of the original poster is gone from the site and Meta. Normally the OP's name card on posts and comments are shaded to differentiate them. This appears to be gone. 

The CSS rule

.owner {
    background: #F6F6F6;
}


should be corrected to

.owner {
    background: #F1F5E6; /* Or whatever the color should be */
}

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where did OP background color go?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's showing up fine for me today, both here and on the main site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5F6F6F6 appears to be the right color, I'm also not seeing an issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have to agree that these boxes are barely visible, especially the "edited" and "answered" boxes. The `quote` boxes are either well-distinguishable from the background (http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/950/i-think-the-quote-blocks-should-be-more-visible-on-this-site#comment1526_950) Can't they be given a very little green tint?


















As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet.

It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working.

So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :)

[off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On the ads topic, you'll notice that this site is part of a network of sites (see the footer at the bottom of the page for the selection), the bigger older members of the network stackoverflow.com serverfault.com and superuser.com do carry adverts (which are scaled back for high rep registered users) and do get a lot of visitors. This site does carry cross-network promotional ads and other links (see the occasional ads on the right-hand side for questions in other family members) and there's the StackExchange drop-down at the top of the page that links to trending questions across the network.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for sharing your experience, it's definitely valuable.  Hopefully our promotions will start to pull in more people who will stick around.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the answer :) And i hope you will get a lot of new users, i have tried to promote the site to my freinds and on my own danish forum for android. Other than that i love the way you have build this site. Good Job :)


















I've been lurking on Android-SE for months, on-and-off, mostly to flag a few things every day, to check for something I can answer (mostly non-existent, with the 1+ year old device I currently have). I've seen the promotions previously, and while a good idea generally (who wouldn't mind free stuff?!), I always thought something like "this probably won't work well enough". The thing is, such contests award only spurious contributions to the site in the space of a single week or so -- something that the analysis of eldarerathis proves. Moreover, it tends to reward not the loyal users, but rather some random people which were drawn to the site because of the promotion, not because they genuinely like the site. 

You can't quite build a stable community this way, me thinking. What would work better is to reward long-lasting, positive contributions to the site, not only in the way of answering and asking questions, but general site governance. It's no big secret that meta participation is low here, chat is deserted, there are too many low-value questions and answers, the tags organization could use some love. Why not reward such activity instead?

For example, announce a "Device/manufacturer cleanup week", where all questions and answers about a particular handset or a group of related handsets are examined -- the obscure unanswerable ones are closed, some low-quality ones are deleted, answers are cleaned up, device-specific tags are removed where possible, etc. Some general suggestions following this train of thought:


Announce this sufficiently in advance on meta and allow for opinions/suggestions/improvements before actually starting it.
Devise a methodology of evaluating contributions (e.g. some sooper-seekrit SQL magic that collects number of retags/edits/deletions/helpful flags and spews a score of some kind). A scoreboard of sorts would be a good addition to promote competition.
Restrict the contest to users that have joined the site X months/weeks ago and have scored a minimum of Y rep ("So, you want to win a new phone on Anroid-SE? Sorry kid, hang around for a while, help out with the site, and you'll have a running chance the next time around"). This will ward off drive-bys which only join the site because of the reward.
Keep the rewards secret until the contest is over. If you don't know what you are going to win, whether it's random SE schwag signed by Jeff and Joel, or a new handset, you have the right motivation to participate -- you are not doing it for the reward itself, but rather to score nerd cred and help out a community you care about. After the contest is over, the SE team can decide what rewards are appropriate, judging from the overall level and quality of participation. Exceptional participation can be rewarded with a substantial award, and meh contributions can get a simple mug with Android logo, for example.


Finally, we don't need no stinking phones. No, really. I'd do all this kind of stuff for an Android-SE T-shirt. A shiny new phone doesn't seem a proper reward for spending basically a few minutes of one's time to answer a question. The more disproportionate the reward, the more people are inclined to cheat their way through to claim it. People won't join Android-SE only to get a T-shirt, but they will if the prize is an electronic gadget. That's why there is no significant positive effect from the competitions -- the prizes don't match the commitment. With cheaper prizes, the contest can be run much more frequently, every month even, and the SE financial investment would be pretty much the same.

And really finally, allow for converting a prize into a cash donation to a selected Android-related project. No use for a new phone if you already got one recently, it would probably end up on an eBay equivalent somewhere. I'd rather donate the full prize equivalent to a project than go through the hassle of selling unneeded stuff online to get only half of that. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would really love to see some Android.SE swag (t-shirts, etc.).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"The prizes don't match the commitment" is a good point.  I would say that would be OK if the contests were more popular, but 10-20 participants is not enough.  On the other hand, our tags and so on aren't perfect but I actually don't think they're a significant issue, other sites have much worse problems with them.  A clean site is important to attracting & keeping users but I don't think a marginal improvement will attract enough for "Cleanup Week" to be considered viable for a promotion.


















There is so much text here, so I will keep it short:

I had the same thought. Tag based promotion just doesn't work well on AN.SX. IMHO the best promotion is purely reputation based, with a slight addition. Something like:


Questions Week - earn XXX rep by asking questions within a week
Answers Week - earn XXX rep by answering questions within a week
New Users Week - every user between 0-200 rep, that earns XXX rep within a week 


or just


Reputation Week - earn XXX rep in a week


Where winners will be randomly chosen between the eligible users. Maybe this will also attract more users to edit the tag wiki to earn the rep.

I can't repro. are you saying that you can't see #f6f6f6 bgcolor?

I'm not sure if it there was a change, but I thought the color was more visible before (though I had swapped graphics card after the last time I had used this site, and the colors look slightly different after that), but in the [mockup](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fFqXo.png) you used `#F2F2F2` which has better contrast.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@YiJiang Sounds like you might want to check your monitor calibration, you will have lost any custom settings in your graphics card and drivers change, and been set to whatever the new defaults are. It could also be possible that plug and play isn't correctly identifying your monitor settings through the new card.

This isn't really a question. I was about to post it in chat but figured not many people would see it there.

Recently I've noticed several questions being closed by 5 regular close voters, without mod involvement.  This is awesome!  I think this is the big indicator of the site becoming "self-sustainable", for lack of a better phrase.

I noticed that https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vanillavanilla exists currently as a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android. I know there was a request to merge these tags previously: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/428/merge-stock-stock-android-vanilla-define-stock-androidMerge stock, stock-android, vanilla; define "stock-android"

I'm curious, though, if this is actually correct or if it's confusing. https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/431/981Lie Ryan's answer to that request sums up my personal understanding of "stock" vs "vanilla" rather well:


  I think a better definition for "stock" is a
  manufacturer/carrier-blessed ROMs for a particular device, including
  upgrades. I prefer to define it this way because some people may not
  realize that they have an upgraded ROM due to automatic OTA upgrades.
  
  And "vanilla" are ROM which attempts to be as close as possible to
  original AOSP ROMs (e.g. by removing carrier/manufacturer
  customization and adding none of their own customization). A vanilla
  ROM may or may not be produced by a third-party.
  
  In particular, only "Pure Google Experience" phones (e.g. G1, Nexus
  One, Nexus S), had a ROM that is both stock (comes with the device)
  and vanilla (no manufacturer/carrier customization).


Now the above has always been my understanding, too, with "stock" referring to "the ROM your device was stocked with" (i.e. off the shelf). However, the tag wiki itself for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android seems to be unable to decide what "stock" is either. The summary states:


  Broadly, the Android OS that shipped with your device or as updated by
  your carrier or the manufacturer.


...but then the extended tag wiki says:


  This is in contrast to devices with custom operating systems or
  after-market applications that dramatically change the user interface.


This seems entirely contradictory, since in many cases the OS that ships with your device does dramatically change the user interface.

Can we please find some consistency here? I've personally never attributed "stock" to mean unomodified Android from source so I'm not entirely sure where it got conflated with that definition, but either way this is currently just...confusing.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's revisit the "stock" vs. "vanilla" tagging, shall we?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The conclusion did seem to be that they were different.  For the moment, I've deleted the `vanilla` synonym.  I'd say it, `aosp-rom`, and `vanilla-rom` should be made synonyms of `vanilla-android`, or something like that.  Then we can add good tag wikis that distinguish it from stock and watch the usage for a bit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis The extended tag wiki doesn't seem contradictory to me, it's a case of making sense in context. Reading the tag excerpt together with the extended as a following sentence,  I read it like this: "This is in contrast to devices with custom operating systems or after-market applications that dramatically change the user interface [*from the stock interface supplied with the device*]." In this case putting a vanilla/AOSP ROM onto a device supplied with Sense/TouchWiz/MotoBlur would be changing the interface from stock to vanilla.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn: Hm, okay, I could see that interpretation. I really did not read it that way myself, so maybe some clarification is needed in the wording.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis True, does look like it needs editing to remove any ambiguity. Not even sure why that needs to be in two parts, it looks short enough to all be in the Excerpt.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't seem to find any tag related to AOSP Android, Vanilla Android etc any more, has someone killed them? All I can see is stock-android (with a stock synonym)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have updated the Stock-Android tag's wiki as below (currently in the review queue) but as we don't seem to have any vanilla/aosp tags any more have left that off?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn `vanilla` was a synonym, it didn't have any questions tagged independently. We're going to have to retag as appropriate unfortunately.  I've added [vanilla-android](http://android.stackexchange.com/tags/vanilla-android/synonyms) to all the questions containing the word "vanilla" that should be tagged as such; probably just ones improperly tagged `stock-android` left.


















Following from Lie Ryan's definitions, to get a less confusing set of tag wiki's I'd propose something like this:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android wiki excerpt


  The version of Android originally on the device as supplied by the manufacturer or phone network, including any customizations, alternative interfaces and updates.


Full wiki


  Stock Android can be thought of as the software that was loaded on the phone while it was sealed in a box in a phone shop's stock room, or what would be installed if you sent it back to the shop/manufacturer for servicing, or official updates.
  
  Various manufacturers have their own custom interfaces and collections of modified apps that they install on the majority of their devices as part of that device's stock OS, these include HTC's Sense, Samsung's TouchWiz, Motorola's Blur and Sony Ericsson's Timescape and Rachael interfaces.
  
  For a "Pure Google Experience" phone such as one of the Google Nexus devices, stock Android will be just the plain, vanilla Android OS.
  
  If you have rooted your phone or installed a custom ROM you no longer have a stock version of Android on your phone.


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vanilla-androidvanilla-android
Excerpt


  An unmodified version of the Android OS that is as close as possible to the open source AOSP Android version. A vanilla version of Android will use the original Android UI and won't have any modified apps.


Full wiki


  A vanilla, plain version of Android is one which uses the Android interface and apps as supplied by the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and doesn't modify those in any way. A Vanilla Android OS may often include custom (and proprietary) drivers required to take full advantage of a device's hardware, and may also include a few extra apps to take advantage of that device's hardware or access a phone network's features but will be otherwise unmodified.
  
  All "Pure Google Experience" devices, such as the Google Nexus range of phones, are supplied with an unmodified, plain, vanilla version of Android as standard. Additionally many budget devices from smaller manufacturers run vanilla Android with little to no customization.
  
  Some custom ROMs pride themselves on being a vanilla, AOSP version of Android that their users prefer to the customized versions installed by default on the phones.


Throwing this up here, to see if we all agree on the definitions before I change anything.

It's not so much the act of rooting (though you do have to make some fundamental changes on some devices), more that rooted users have the access to put themselves into a non-stock state without loading a different ROM, where non-rooted users normally don't.

I need the invoice/receipt for the Kindle Fire from Amazon.
The company which sends it to me in Denmark, can't mail it without the invoice/receipt for the customs.

Could you send me a copy of it to my mail?

Thanks a lot and have a great day.

I wouldn't mind seeing some good Android questions migrated from SU. $DEITY knows we have our own fair share of not-so-good questions. There have been a few migrated questions from SU recently, if memory serves, and they were mostly okay.

Some things to keep in mind:


Developer questions are explicitly off-topic, so don't bother.
We have commonly duplicated questions about updates and rooting, so expect such questions to be promptly closed when migrated:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-deviceHow do I root my device?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1/ive-rooted-my-phone-now-what-what-do-i-gain-from-rootingI've rooted my phone. Now what? What do I gain from rooting?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2695/when-will-my-phone-get-the-android-2-3-update-gingerbreadWhen will my phone get the Android 2.3 update (Gingerbread)?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/14766/when-will-my-device-get-the-android-4-0-update-ice-cream-sandwichWhen will my device get the Android 4.0 update (Ice Cream Sandwich)?

Please, please, please don't migrate questions just to get rid of them (i.e. poorly written, shopping recommendations, or of the "Why doesn't my X work?", "Best app to do Y" variety with little additional information). Better close them outright, because we will anyway1.


Disclaimer: This is only opinion of my own as a user here and I expect Android moderators would have something to say as well.

1 This is mostly valid for questions asked by first-time SE users. It's usually hard to pry out the necessary information to answer the question, and those can linger for ages unanswered. Experienced SE users show greater cooperation, even if their questions lack important details.

If we go through with this, I'll put an update on our blog about the change and reminding people what does and doesn't belong on Android. Thanks for your insights!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@nhinkle Mind making sure the other mods get that memo? We just got a pretty bad one: http://android.stackexchange.com/q/20839/1465b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: I take full responsibility, it was completely my fault on that migration, I apologize.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@studiohack No worries, sometimes it's hard when you have a bunch of close-voters telling you where it belongs. Topic seems to take precedence over quality when it comes to close voters, unfortunately!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead thanks for the understanding... Not sure what I was thinking at the time... Cheers! :)


















Currently, there are 960 https://android.stackexchange.com/unansweredquestions with no upvoted answers on the main site. Of those:


around 800 are more than a month old.
710 have no answer at all.
more than 400 questions are of score 0 or less.


Additionally, Android-SE has a 85% answer rate which puts us squarely in the lowest percentile (around 70th place out of 84).

I hope I'm not alone thinking that something needs to be done to improve the situation. What other sites are doing:


The guys over at TeX-SE hold regular https://tex.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1560/regular-lets-deal-with-unanswered-questions-chat-meetings"Answer the Unanswered" sessions that are quite structured and efficient. Questions are answered, deleted, merged etc. as necessary. The site manages to keep the unanswered volume around 200 regardless of the growth TeX-SE has experienced recently. I'd venture that something like 30-50 questions are dealt with in every session. See the http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/41/conversation/answer-the-unanswered-session-1chat session to get an idea how it works.
We do something similar on http://travel.stackexchange.comTravel-SE -- there is a somewhat irregular https://travel.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/360/halloween-answer-a-thon"Answer-a-thon" sessions that are scheduled a week or so in advance in chat. 


I think we can do something similar on our own, depending on high-rep users and mods time constraints. I'd say a whole-day, drop-in session, held once per month in the weekend. I think we should be focusing most on the following:


Closing old unanswered questions with weird device issues. Set some limit of say 2 months since last user intervention on the question. Decrease this for low-rep users that haven't visited the site for a long period -- say a month or so, or have only this one question. Reason for close would be most often "too localized".
Finding duplicates, or creating artificially ones -- for example, hunting down OS upgrade information for devices we don't currently list in the "When will my device receive the X upgrade". 


What do you guys think? Some further suggestions?

I'd be hesitant to close these unless they're old and abandoned, as you note, but also I'd want to make sure that we have a consensus that that's the best thing to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like the idea, but I also know that unanswered, un-upvoted questions like these are also auto-deleted after some time. I wouldn't to interfere with that.

I'm pretty sure that the answer is that Android.StackExchange only accepts questions and answers written in English, but I can't seem to find anything in the FAQ or Meta that definitively states this.

Do we have a policy on this? What is it? I feel that we ought to have something written down on this before I do anything with that question.



(prompted by this question: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/20013/android-htc-touch2-megaAndroid HTC Touch2/Mega written in Turkish)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are we English language only?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm fairly sure we've closed non-English questions before, so there's some precedent, but good idea bringing it to Meta.


















This has been already https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/120744/is-english-required-on-stack-exchangeasked already on MSO, although without "official" answer. There's also https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/40285/150290this answer by Jeff Atwood (admittedly, two years old, and before creation of the diverse family of Area 51 sites) specifically on a question whether English-only policy should be in the FAQ:

Do we really need a NO ELEPHANTS sign?
I mean, isn't such a thing obvious? Would you go to a forum where everyone was communicating in French and type
Hey French Dudes, I got a question but I don't know French so I'm just going to go ahead and ask it in English anyway?

Note that this is different from Stack Overflow, where https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/13676/is-english-required-on-stack-overflowEnglish is a strict requirement.
There doesn't seem to be a general consensus or an ex cathedra response, and it seems that it's up to each community to decide for themselves.
Although I can appreciate why people would want to be able to ask questions in other languages than English (I'm not a native English speaker either, nor even live in a country where English is an official language), allowing this on Android-SE is going to be a major PITA from pretty much any perspective -- moderation, quality, percentage answered questions, user participation -- for a small to negligible benefit.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. Even though I love languages (I speak some French and Spanish), it would make it very difficult to moderate here if we allowed any language to be used.


















There's a new Google+/Blogspot Android resource offering, among other things, a weekly Hangout to talk about Android stuff.

Its name? Android Enthusiasts


https://plus.google.com/103783886144374597555/postshttps://plus.google.com/103783886144374597555/posts

It seems to me Somebody might think they're sponging off of our name. Even if it's not some sort of violation it seems rather dirty.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Copyright violation, dirty pool, or just a coincidence?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps it's an honest mistake? Maybe they don't suspect the existence of Android-SE. I mean, is "Android Enthusiasts" so popular that it can be considered a "trademarked" name of sorts? Perhaps contacting the hangout hosts can help with working things out.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We are the first hit in Google for "Android Enthusiasts", but you don't see that in the result -- it just says Android.  You'd have to actually come here to see the name.  Perhaps that's something the team should address.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, I think the team does need to address it. Hence why I tagged this with "support".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett I'll pass this up the chain. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even if it's not trademark violation and putting aside the question of "dirtiness", due to the popularity of StackExchange, Android.SE has a very good search engine ranking; it would be in Derek's best interest to avoid competing for "Android Enthusiast" keyword as it might confuse people in his community who are googling for his blog that are unaware of the difference between this Android Enthusiast and that Android Enthusiast, especially once we had our own community blog.


















I think the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contactscontacts tag should have a synonym of "people" as the new contact/people manager in android 4.0 is now called people.

I also noticed that we have a tag https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/xyboardxyboard. This should probably be changed to motorola-xyboard, or maybe even motorola-droid-xyboard to follow the same naming as the other device tags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can these tags be created/merged/synonym-ed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The latter is done.  I think there might be a valid distinction between contacts in general and the apps.  Perhaps `contacts-app` and `people-app` should be synonyms, with `contacts` remaining for the general case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead if that is the case, the tagwiki needs to be updated. it says the questions should be 'about the built-in app for managing Contacts or a manufacturer enhanced version. By default, the Contacts app synchronizes with the Contacts app associated with your Google account.'


















I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called "People"? 

Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet.

I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating "contacts-app" and "people-app" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I concur with Matthew's suggestion.


















Could someone please clarify when a post should include the Android version, and when they should not?

This question stems https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/20177/revisionsfrom a retag on a question I https://android.stackexchange.com/q/20177/80recently posted. The workaround/solution that I found was buried in the OS of the phone, hence it seems appropriate that it should have been tagged 2.3 Gingerbread. I'm not worried about qualifying for the contest (clicking the buttons and throwing pizels is good enough a prize for me), I'm just looking for when and why to tag as 2.3.

As far as I can tell, the question is describing a problem that stems possibly from the OS, the hardware (in perfect condition), the hardware (after long use), and subsequent software installed. The tag was also describing the type of problem (power, as best I could describe, though display may also fit). 


What is the policy for tagging with the OS? 
How can I tell when tagging with the OS is extraneous or meta-tagging?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retag Clarification: Tagging of Distribution Code Namesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You mentioned your OS version in the text of the answer, for a question that doesn't appear (at first) to be OS specific this is all that's needed. See also http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/260/


















Unfortunately, the name "Android Enthusiasts" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it.

However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say "Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange" rather than "Android - Stack Exchange," so that change will be implemented soon.

If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching "Android Enthusiasts" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But their site is the top one in Bing :P


















Ignoring for the moment that "Google Play" is a stupid name, how should we tag it?

Obviously we need to have https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-playgoogle-play as a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/marketmarket (which I have done), but should the new name be the master?  We should probably also take a look at questions tagged the latter than aren't about the Android Market specifically, since the tag may have been seen as generic unlike its other synonym https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-marketandroid-market.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should we tag Google Play?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5google-play probably needs to replace the market tag. However, Google-play also includes Play Movies, Play Music, etc. etc.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point.  We'll need `play-music` synonymized with `google-music` and so on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We may also want a `play-store` synonym since that's how the app identifies itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think we should :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aah Google, Y u no think about poor moderators when you change fancy names!! B)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5***If*** `market` is going to be replaced, it should be replaced with `google-play-store`. Similarly: `google-music` to `google-play-music`, `google-books` to `google-play-books`, etc. I'm still not convinced that we should, though.


















I just got a message from Derek Ross on G+.


  Hello +Al Everett +Anna Lear +Laura Dobrzynski, 
  
  I would like to respond to your post
  https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/865/copyright-violation-dirty-pool-or-just-a-coincidenceCopyright violation, dirty pool, or just a coincidence?.
  I would have loved to respond on that website, however I am not a
  member. I tried to create an account but I need 5 rep to respond or
  answer the topic. Whatever that means... Probably to cut down on spam.
  Anyways...
  
  I was viewing our traffic stats for our blog and I noticed them coming
  from this website. I had never heard of this website, so I visited it
  and found this thread.
  
  +Scott Anderson and myself have been loosely calling ourselves Android Enthusiasts for years now. Neither of us had ever visited nor heard of
  this website. No disrespect, dirty pool or any type of copyright
  violation was ever intended. As the term Android Enthusiast is so
  generic, this is just a mere coincidence.
  
  With that said, we're huge fans of all things Android as it seems
  members of your site are as well. We would love for anyone from your
  site to join our weekly show. We welcome any and all Android
  enthusiasts from that vast community that surrounds Android. Let us
  know if you're interested and we'll try to find a topic that is
  relevant.
  
  Feel free to post this on the original website thread for me as I
  cannot. Thank you.

What did we end up with? Which solution should be used? I like the idea about the highest number of reputation points in a week.. 

What did the staff decide?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The current [Food Fight](http://androidfoodfight.com) contest is running on [different rules](http://androidfoodfight.com/rules) with prizes based on highest number of votes for a question/answer and for highest number of views, which does feel like its working differently than previous contests. Personally I like the way that the current [Mass Effect contest](http://me3missions.com/) is being run over on http://Gaming.stackexchange.com That tiered approach requiring a number of scored posts, along with shared links seems a good way to do it


















I think they're a direct result of the "anti-shopping" policy. We don't want people asking "what's the best X". For the most part helping people help themselves is a good thing, and pointing someone to a site that reviews hardware and/or apps gives them such a tool.

But I think you're right. All too often it's a situation of "I do not know how (or I am too lazy) to craft a good web search. Please won't someone do it for me?"

In a lot of cases, we should probably be pointing people to https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questions/Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions? (Assuming we're still keeping that up to date.)

I suppose a consideration is "will this question and its answers be useful to anyone in three months, six months, a year?" If the answer is "no" then it should be closed as too localized. But then each question needs to be evaluated on its own merits. I'm not sure if we can come up with a blanket policy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In thinking about it a bit more, maybe we could come up with some kind of decent canonical question for this. Something like "What informational online Android resources are available?" with various sections for things that could actually have some merit (maybe hardware, app reviews, things of that nature) instead of a million questions that are incredibly similar. Do you think that could be helpful?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, that's sort of what the "Where can I ask..." question is supposed to be. A canonical CW question that's more generic might be useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, fair point. I think I kind of interpreted that question - based on the title, anyway - as more of a "Where can I ask/post/discuss X" as opposed to simply "Where can I find information about X". I wouldn't have thought to list something like [GSM Arena](http://www.gsmarena.com/) on that question, for example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, I did just copy it from Meta Stack Overflow. That it doesn't fit quite as well here doesn't surprise me.


















I think, a master tag play-store should be created (if it doesn't already exist). market, android-market & google-play tags deserve to be synonym of play-store.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, that won't work. Google Play is the "umbrella" name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5K.. then, ignore google-play from answer.


















I'm not convinced that we should rush to make synonyms. After all, all those pre-March-2011 questions are about the Market, not Google Play. Further, Google Play is not yet available globally.

I think, instead, that there should be a clear delineation between the tags before and after the launch of Google Play. Of course, the wikis and excerpts for each tag should clearly explain the difference.

In much the same way questions about Eclair or Froyo don't apply to Ice Cream Sandwich and vice versa, so also to old questions about Market, Google Music, et al., don't apply to their new Google Play counterparts.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there really a substantial difference?  More so than between versions 2 and 3 of the Market, for example?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not so far. Enforcing a synonym is going to make questions about the market from '10 and '11 seem really weird. We're all about the future readers, remember?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If they didn't change the name that would still hold true, which is why I mentioned the Market versions.  If questions become too localized we can close them, answers can be updated.  I don't think having them as separate tags will do anything apart from create work short-term watching for when people use the wrong tag and correcting it.

Did you know this site's graduation anniversary is coming up on March 24th? Congratulations!

How about a contest or some other fun activity to stir things up a little? After a year of great Q&A, we'd like the opportunity to "give back" for everyone's hard work.

Anniversary events area a great way to spark some interest in the extracurricular activity in your site (more meta participation). An “anniversary event" can be just about anything. Take a look at http://blog.superuser.com/2011/08/19/super-users-2nd-birthday-super-contest/Super User’s 2nd Birthday Super Contest for inspiration. It doesn’t have to be a contest. Dream up whatever you feel the community will find interesting, and go for it.

Start a meta post or chat event to work out the details. Rally support for your event and bring it to our attention (community@stackexchange.com). We're really interested in community-lead initiatives, so let’s just say, if you can work out the details, we’re very motivated to say “go for it!”

I'm not sure if that's normal but it looks fine.  Chrome 18 (on XP only, see comments) seems to be bolding the font and it's very jagged:



And IE 8 looks to be using an entirely different font, and cuts off the lower part of the post when the title wraps more than one line:

Nope.  Once you create a bounty, you lose that rep forever.  I think you used to be able to award it to yourself but it "didn't count", and now it's just the more sensible solution of not letting you award it to yourself at all.

If someone else is able to help or independently discovers the same fix as you, you may want to consider giving them the bounty.  Otherwise just let it expire — if it does without you awarding it, half the rep will go to the highest-scoring answer if it's at +2 or more, if there is such an answer.  (If not, no one gets any.)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the clarification! It seems a shame for all that rep to just disappear, though, so I hope someone at least tries to put up something helpful, even if it turns out that I've already got the solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose this is to prevent someone from issuing a bounty to encourage answers, only to not award it, correct?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chance I believe so, yes.  You have to be particularly nasty to get a good answer and not reward it if you've already lost the rep, though sadly it has happened at least once that I know of.


















Why not create https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fm-radiofm-radio as well, retag the existing https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/radioradio and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/radio-firmwareradio-firmware questions as necessary, and make https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/radioradio synonym to one of the tags (not sure which one should be most appropriate, probably https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fm-radiofm-radio since it's most commonly associated with "radio" out of context).

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cellular-radiocellular-radio is also a good idea, although I am not a big fan of tag proliferation.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We can probably rename `radio` to the most prelevant one (and retag as neccessary to the other); I'd avoid having an ambiguous name like `radio` as a synonym if possibleb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: The rationale for the synonym comes exactly from its ambiguity: new users will tend to search first for [tag:radio] if their question is about FM or firmware -- just the key word that comes to mind first. If the tag is to be resurrected anyway, it might as well be synonymized with one of the others and call it a day. These tags are a bad example since they have a common root, but hopefully you can see how this can be a problem if they were not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's highly unlikely for anyone to search `[radio]` unless the tag exists, which is different from searching `radio`.  Typing `radio` into the tag area of a question will result in anything containing that, e.g., `fm-radio`, being suggested.  Not having it shouldn't negatively impact search.


















Go to Android Enthusiasts site. Then type in title:calendar search into the search field. Expect to only see answers in the returned results that contain titles that have both calendar and search in the title, but no that is not what you get. You get a lot more results that do not have both words in the title.

So, how does one get the search to do the above (without resorting to using Google, Bing, etc.).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to search for title containing multiple words?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That behavior wouldn't make sense for that search -- how would you distinguish searching for posts that have "search" in the body and "calendar" in the title from it?  Google's operators work the same way (i.e., `op:x y` only applies the operator to `x`).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You are right.  The syntax of searching for *both* `foo` and `bar` in Googles search engine would be `"foo" "bar"`.


















It's a little verbose, but it can be achieved like so:


  +title:calendar +title:search


However, that's not returning any results.

To see the constrained search in action, see https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=%20%2btitle:calendar%20%2btitle:facebook&submit=searchthis link for this search:

This question is pretty terrible, IMO:

https://android.stackexchange.com/q/13069/1465Can I use dual boot in my Android mobile phone?
I want to know is there any boot loader modifying tool for android so that I can use my cell as dual boot. Like Symbian- Android, Android - Windows Mobile, Android - Java, Android - Bada.
Is it possible.

The formatting/wording can be fixed, and it could be made a "How" question about a specific device and OSes (and we have gotten https://android.stackexchange.com/q/21357/1465questions https://android.stackexchange.com/q/21369/1465like that), but I think it would still be problematic:

I'm not sure we have the relevant expertise.  Getting WP7 (for example) to run on an Android device would require just as much WP7 knowledge as Android knowledge, I would think.
Lie's answer does answer the question, but is it useful?  A specific answer for a specific device would be useful, but most of the time the answer will be "No, no one's figured out how to do this on that phone. As far as I know."

The problem is that I don't really know how to close it, because:

It's a real question. There are valid reasons for wanting to do this.
It's at least partly on-topic.  We deal with Android as hardware, not just the Android OS.  We've had some relatively decent questions about Ubuntu Linux on Android devices.
It's constructive.  Well, the current version of the question isn't, but as noted it could be rewritten.

Given this I've thought up two solutions:

We create a CW question to cover this, the converse of https://android.stackexchange.com/q/6849/1465Can I install Android on my non-Android device? — "Can I install a different OS on my Android device?"  Dual booting specifically could be covered in this or possibly another CW question.
We decide that questions about other operating systems are off-topic.  (Obviously this would not include questions about interacting with a device using a PC.)

Does anyone have thoughts on these ideas or any other ideas?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should we do about questions involving other operating systems on Android hardware?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would go with your first solution. It's still relevant enough to Android....  How do sites like superuser.com or the Ubuntu/Apple SEs handle this?


















I'm really of two minds on these kinds of questions. On the one hand, I can understand their basis as an "Android question" in that we do handle hardware stuff on a regular basis here. From that standpoint, I think a canonical CW question is probably a good idea since the answer to the vast majority of these questions is "Sorry, nobody's done this yet." This is especially true of OSes like Windows Phone and iOS which are not open source, and thus cannot be easily ported.

On the other hand, completely honestly, I think these questions are off-topic. They're not Android questions, and I don't personally consider them Android hardware questions either because they don't involve using the hardware while running Android. These are WP or iOS or whatever else questions because they are questions about how to port these OSes to hardware that happens to be designed to run Android. I think the Ubuntu et al questions we've had are very different because they all (so far) involve running Ubuntu in a chroot environment within the Android userspace. However, a question along the lines of "Can I run Ubuntu natively on X device?" would be off-topic to me. Extending that logic, emulating the OS or apps in question would be on-topic.

However, some of this also depends on where we're drawing the line on hardware questions. In the past we've accepted things like "What is this sticker on my battery?" which I would have considered off-topic myself. If we're going to allow questions about Android hardware then I think we pretty much have to accept these OS porting and dual booting questions in some capacity.

It's been noted by some other Android users that people on this site really don't vote often. Voting increases engagement and helps us sort out good/bad content. Why aren't people voting and how can we encourage additional voting?

Full disclosure: I haven't used this site very much and I thus haven't voted or done much yet but I'm very active else where. Perhaps too many users are drive-bys, but I'd like to see that changed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why aren't we voting more?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Relevant (semi-)recent chat discussion http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3826848#3826848 with comparison of our vote numbers to other sitesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Additionally other things like moderating (reviewing, editing posts) is currently not enough on this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ha so this was an issues in 2012 too?! I guess an Android site will always have this issue.


















I took a peek at the oldest https://android.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?page=74&tab=newestUnaswered questions and most of them are either Too Localized or Not Real Questions (and thus impossible to ever answer) or Shopping Requests (thus not constructive or Off Topic). 

Should we go through and close some of these? I can't vote yet so I rose some flags on the most obvious offenders but before I continue I'd like to know if this is something we want to do.

Honestly these questions in particular are unaswerable and are clogging up the Unanswered page for miles. Closing them means they don't count as Unanswered (because they can't or shouldn't be answered by us) and means the worst of them (zero/negative voted posts) will eventually be deleted by the system after closure. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we go back and close the unanswerable questions in the old Unanswered backlog?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The bottom of the [votes](http://android.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?page=74&tab=votes) and [newest](http://android.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?page=74&tab=newest) tabs are the best place to start, they're the worst questions or the least likely to ever be answered, and spot-checking confirms lots are close-worthy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Flag them and one of us mods will look at them asapb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BryanDenny so I have been, but I'm only one man :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BenBracka thanks, I took care of the ones you flagged yesterday


















Slow down, dude. I see over two dozen flags in the queue.

By and large, the community should decide whether questions should stay or go. While we Moderators are part of the community, and part of our job (especially early on) is to help guide the community, the flag queue is really for those situations that the community can't do by itself.


egregious spam
patent nonsense
good questions that are unfortunately in the wrong place and should be moved to a Stack Exchange site not listed in the Close dialog
questions or answers that no amount of editing will make into a good post


A lot of the stuff I'm seeing in the flag queue now are things that the community can deal with. There are plenty of people who can vote to close. We also have enough people to vote to delete. Certainly these questions deserve their downvotes.

So please only flag things that need to be dealt with by a Moderator's super powers. It's not like the site is "full". A question that's on an obscure topic may still get an answer some day. If it doesn't, then it's lack of votes and views will move it to the bottom of the list.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "doesn't belong here" flag also brings posts to the attention of 10k users (though we don't have many), so they can be handled by the community. Visibility is also a problem; it's really hard to find the closeable questions here, and with all that noise it's hard to browse the Unanswered list for *answerable* problems. I'd cast close votes but I can't yet, and there's no other place right now to bring up the (many many) too localized/NARQs in the back log


















I've gone through old posts and closed/deleted them before, but I think you have to be careful with ones you think are Too Localized.  An old unanswered question featuring something you've never heard of will definitely seem localized, but that's actually different from the close reason.  We close things that are Too Localized by nature, rather than by content.

For example, a shopping question will always become out of date and will rarely be relevant to others; a perfect candidate for Too Localized.  On the other hand, someone's strange connection issues on a non-name tablet only seem localized until other people show up with the same issue.  Hopefully we can see the difference.

I haven't looked at any of your flags yet so I don't know what you've considered Too Localized, but I think this is something we should keep in mind regardless.  Edit: I see a number of them were owned by dead accounts and didn't have enough information to be answerable.  With no one around to provide that information, flagging these is definitely the right thing to do.

I do agree with Al's general sentiment that if it doesn't need to be dealt with by a mod, then we can let the voting and so on filter it out.  If you're flagging things that need it, though, by all means do so.  I'd prefer a clogged flag queue over an empty one because at least we have a list of the things that need attention instead of being clueless :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Many rode the border between NARQ/too localized and without the original asker we'll never answer the ones I flagged as too localized.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unfortunately, many a OP just visited once to drop his question (and a Google Search often reveals, it was dropped not only here) -- and never return[s|ed] to check, so you can shorten that to "we'll never answer the ones", omitting the ominous "original asker"... :(


















This has been a hazy line for about as long as I can remember, and it something I briefly touched on in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/893/981another Meta post, so this is a discussion for which I think we're long overdue.

I lean in the other direction, and think many (most?) of these are not Android questions. If a compelling argument can be made that a hardware question is in some way truly unique to the Android operating system or if it's a question of how Android interfaces with said hardware (such as settings that may affect it in some way), then I think it's fine. If it's more along the lines of "https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/14255/how-does-the-accelerometer-detect-accelerationHow does an accelerometer work?" then I personally feel that it should be off-topic.

Having said that, if everyone else disagrees with me then I have no serious issues with accepting hardware questions. I just think that it makes the site that much less focused on Android.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand this take on it.  I would differentiate a "How does this work?" from a "How does this affect me?", though; I think the question I linked is of the latter type, or at least could be rewritten to be that way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: I think that's an important and completely valid distinction. The one you linked, in fact, probably wouldn't irk me at all if it was written as more of a "How does this affect me?" style of question. Currently it feels kind of icky (to me) because it's worded more like "How does an LCD display work?", though there's certainly a subtext of "...and how does that affect me as an Android user?" (or possibly "...and how can I configure Android to maximize my battery life?").b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis where would you draw the line, we have questions on things like [USB charging](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5262/) vs [wall charging](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1887/), there's nothing unique to Android or even smartphones in those, and they're open questions with upvoted answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn: I would consider those to be questions presented more as "How does this affect me as an Android user?" which I think are okay. Had they been "What's the maximum amount of power provided by a USB port?" or something of that nature (which would have garnered essentially the same answers) then I would consider it more of an electrical/hardware question. That's how I've been trying to judge appropriateness.


















Many times the answer to someone's problem can be found at one of the other excellent Android sites out there on the WWWeb. Rather than recreate the wheel, the simplest thing to do is just give a link to this other content.

Is an answer that is (mostly) just a link to an outside source useful?

If not, what should be done about such answers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are answers that are just links Answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The downside to this is when the links eventually break. I think linking is OK but maybe a short summary or key highlights would be even better than just a link.


















See https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231/154510Are answers that just contain links elsewhere really "good answers"?

I have nothing to say that devinb's answer doesn't as far as link-only answers being bad.

As for what to do with them, see the FAQ:


  Answers that do not fundamentally answer the question may be removed. This includes answers that are [..] barely more than a link to an external site


I delete such answers in egregious cases, but when there's something important buried in the link or the answerer made some effort I encourage them to edit and summarize the content behind the link.

Otherwise I agree with you and devinb. ***Raw links are not answers.***b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For sure, yes :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The winds blowing in from Meta Stack Overflow are that answers that don't have any useful information besides a link are not answers and should, at best, be converted to a comment. This is further reinforced by the Low Quality Review Queue which offers as one of its delete auto-comments "this is just a link and not an answer" (paraphrased).


















first off sorry if this isn't the right place for this but I find an alternative.

I recently posted an answer to this question which had a 100 rep bounty on it: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/21556/contacts-with-and-without-international-extensionsContacts with and without international extensions

My answer was accepted and up voted a few times. However I don't seem to have been awarded the bounty on it as far as I can tell, even after the grace period has expired.

I received an 'Association Bonus' on the 13th but I think I'm right in saying that it doesn't relate at all to the bounty?

So my question is basically why was the bounty not awarded? Or was it the 'Association Bonus'?

Thanks.

Shall I just delete this question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They cache a lot of stuff for performance. Nah, don't delete.

You know, I actually think I tried to suggest this a few weeks back but I didn't meet the criteria for suggesting the synonym at the time (and then forgot about it). In any case, agreed and done.

You can also just write the user on the Android chat room with @<username> or username:, even if the user is not in the room he will get a notification in the top bar (AFAIK).

There is no mention of CyanogenMod in FAQ, and there is no policy about it. There are only 231 questions related to it, most of them are about rooting and flashing. Are CyanogenMod related questions welcome to http://android.stackexchange.comhttp://android.stackexchange.com?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are CyanogenMod questions accepted on Android SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Only" 231?  I think it's safe to say that anything on this site with hundreds of (open) questions is on-topic.


















If it's a question about installing, configuring, or otherwise using CyanogenMod, then yes, that's perfectly acceptable. CM is Android, just like any other ROM is, so end-user questions about CM are no diferent than end-user questions about other ROMs.

If you have a question about compiling (or otherwise modifying the source of) CyanogenMod then it would be out-of-scope for this site.

Some power users might want, for various reasons, to use a specific revision from the version control that are not officially released or perhaps one of the cloned trees might have features or fixes that have not been merged into the official tree (or even, will never be integrated). I'd say those are still in the domain of what a power user might want to do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LieRyan: Historically, questions along those lines have ended up closed (for example: [How to build / compile su from source?](http://android.stackexchange.com/q/18857)) which I why I stated it that way. I'd have no real problems myself with questions simply about building it as long as the community as a whole seems to agree. I personally build CM from source for several of my devices, just as you note, without making any modifications. That's not a decision I (or anyone) will make unilaterally, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5CM has a long history and a huge install base: 2.3M and growing. Ignoring those users wouldn't be good for the site. http://stats.cyanogenmod.com/

The https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android tag covers versions of the OS that includes manufacturer enhancements, but the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-uistock-ui tag excludes manufacturer enhancements (according to the description).


  stock-android
  The version of Android originally on the device as supplied by the
  manufacturer or phone network, including any customizations,
  alternative interfaces and updates.
  
  stock-ui
  A "stock user interface" refers to a device with the default Android user interface. It lacks both manufacturer/carrier
  enhancements (e.g., Sense, BLUR) and customized ROMs from the mod
  community.


From the description, wouldn't https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vanilla-uivanilla-ui (which doesn't exist) be more appropriate? Or change the description?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Confusion between stock-android and stock-ui tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would agree with you on this, and there was a related discussion about stock vs vanilla here: [Let's revisit the "stock" vs. "vanilla" tagging, shall we?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/852) I'm somewhat inclined to say that `stock-ui` could simply be re-named. Questions about a *specific* stock UI (Sense, BLUR, TouchWiz, etc) should probably be using the more specific tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis: Yes, I think renaming the tag would be more appropriate. There appears to be only 5 questions that use the `stock-ui` tag and they all appear to use it in the correct 'vanilla' sense (although some of these also refer to `stock-android` when I think they really mean `vanilla-android`?)


















There is no description for these tags, are they referring to the same thing? If so then should they be merged? https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sleep-modesleep-mode would appear more popular, although to be honest I prefer the shorter https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sleepsleep and personally I never use the term "sleep-mode", always "sleep".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are [sleep] and [sleep-mode] tags the same? Merge?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess you could possibly argue that `sleep-mode` is when the device is sleeping (screen off and such) and `sleep` could refer to other things. It appears to be used for a couple of questions about sleep patterns and alarms, so `sleep-mode` wouldn't make sense there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis In that case `sleep` is not a good tag, someone's sleeping is not really relevant :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: Oh yeah. IMHO `sleep` is kind of an icky tag for that reason. It's easy to misuse, whereas `sleep-mode` is easier to understand.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, `sleep-mode` is a better tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I had assumed that `sleep` and `sleep-mode` referred to the same thing (ie. computer sleep mode). To be honest, I never imagined that a `sleep` tag, on a technical computer-related site, would refer to anything else. So, as stated, I would agree that `sleep` is not a good tag in this respect. (Should it be removed?) `sleep-mode` avoids any ambiguity.

Android security, like any computer systems security, is an exact science. If an app has a security issue, that is an objective fact, and someone with appropriate expertise can describe the risks involved with reference to facts about what the app does and how it fits into the workings of Android. So how could a question asking for the facts about what security issues exist in a specific app be too subjective? 

I asked a question about what specific security issues exist in a controversial app that had been pulled from the Android market but which some people insist is safe. 

Android.stackexchange has a community knowledgable about Android who like answering questions, https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/32/are-app-specific-questions-appropriateapp-specific questions are on topic here, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/securitysecurity has its own tag, and questions of the form "Is X safe?" are common across the stack exchange family. Since I'm no Android security expert, and since after research, I can only get a very rough and incomplete outline of the facts of the issue, this site seemed the obvious place to ask about what the hard facts were.

I was very surprised to see the question closed for being "subjective". https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/23736/what-specific-security-risks-if-any-does-app-shield-poseHere's the question. (note that I re-wrote it to state and restate explicitly what the focus of the question was. The question itself is the same and you can see the original in edits. I just trimmed background research, context and scene-setting and stated explicitly what kind of facts I was asking for). 

Here's the explanation given for closing:


  This question is not a good fit to our Q&A format. We expect answers to generally involve facts, references, or specific expertise; this question will likely solicit opinion, debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion. See the FAQ for guidance on how to improve it.


How is asking about the facts behind a specific security concern not factual and not involving specific expertise?

I've never seen a question of the form "Is X safe?" closed for being subjective on any stack exchange site, ever. For being poorly written or unclear, sure, but never for being inherently subjective. Here are a few examples of such questions from 5 minutes searching, from stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5417757/how-secure-is-spring-security1, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4015746/is-a-cookie-secure-in-a-https-connection2, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2505496/is-java-that-secure3 and from serverfault: https://serverfault.com/questions/18388/what-is-xtsac-cab-and-is-it-safe-to-load1, https://serverfault.com/questions/305558/is-it-safe-to-use-public-wifi-network-to-remote-desktop-into-a-windows-server2. Many of these are far more subjective than mine, not giving specific reasons for concern and just ask how secure something is in general. They all got good answers that show expertise and reference facts about the product, app or technique in question.

I don't understand why android.stackexchange should be the only site in the stack exchange family where discussing specific security concerns does not "...involve facts, references, or specific expertise" and "will likely solicit opinion, debate, arguments, polling...". Android security is no less of an exact science than security on any other platform.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How are questions about security concerns 'subjective'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the record, the question this is about was deleted with a total vote score of +4, three people having favourited it, over a thousand page views, and two people finding it through search through interest in the subject and commenting saying it shouldn't have been closed. The moderator's main reason given for closing it below is "how can your question be of any future use?" - clearly, many people disagree.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For any who might be interested, a discussion has been opened on the main Meta Stack Overflow site: [Can a moderator delete a quite popular question to prevent discussion of a close decision?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/222948)


















The problem is that no one can predict if an answer to those questions will every be backed by facts or references. Typical examples are "Why does Google not allow one to X?" and such. The probability is high that no one can give facts or references if he is not a Google employee. That's why those questions are often closed, because most answers can only be speculative. In fact, that is true for all questions which involve company policies and decisions.

Regarding the question from you I am not sure if this applies here too. There could be someone with a deep knowledge of Android who can answer this in an good way, so that it fits SX's QA policy. That is why I have voted to reopen the question.

I think overall we should wait before we close such questions. If the answers are only of speculative nature, then the question can be closed (and deleted) later on.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the answer and thanks for the re-open vote. This makes me wonder if what happened here is that people reading the earlier wording of my question saw that it mentioned (as background information) debates about Google policy, and they reflexively reached for the 'close' button without taking the time to see what the question was actually about.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was a bit puzzled by your opening paragraph, and why it said "those questions" as if my question was a Google policy question. I've editing my question here to make sure it's absolutely clear that the question is about the facts of the security issue, and the fact that Google happened to pull the app is background, setting the scene, *not* the focus of the question.


















Firstly, you might want to check out https://security.stackexchange.com/the Security site.  The context is Android, but the point of your question is security issues, so it might be a better fit there.

That said, you noted that the app has been removed from the Market and you can't find much information about it.  It's likely, then, that any answer would be speculative.  Possibly we have some users who studied the app previously but I would consider that unlikely.  This also falls into the Too Localized close reason — the app is gone, no one can get it from the Market; how can your question be of any future use?

Also, and this is more of a personal reason since people regularly disagree with it, you didn't provide any rationale for your question.  Why are you asking this about App Shield?  What about it makes you think it's insecure?  In the words of the FAQ, You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site.  Without this rationale, a form of your question could be asked about every single app that exists, and I don't think that's useful.  Rationale also helps answerers to provide focused and more useful answers.

That's why I closed it as Not Constructive (not quite the same as "subjective"; I was a bit loose with my wording in the comment).

Asides:


I would very much question the idea that security is an exact science.  Everything is a potential security hole, or at least not provably not a security hole.
I would personally favor closing 3/5 of your examples from other sites.  While we do share the broad SE guidelines, we're not bound by what specific questions other sites consider acceptable or unacceptable.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51) "IT Security - Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities". What about my question makes you think I'm an IS Security professional? It would be like a student asking mathexchange.com for help with homework. They'd close it for being trivial, they'd point out that there's no reason to expect IS Security professionals to have specialist knowledge about an Android app, and they'd suggest I try "that Android stackexchange site"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e52) "It's likely, then, that any answer would be speculative. Possibly we have some users who studied the app previously but I would consider that unlikely". This is a comment about the community, not about the question. There's an easy way to find out if anyone can answer a question - and that's to see if anyone answers it. If no-one answers it, no harm is caused - unless you are trying to massage the sites % answered statistics?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53) "This also falls into the Too Localized close reason — the app is gone, no one can get it from the Market; how can your question be of any future use?" - Because, as I explained, the app is unique, and there are people who claim the app is safe advocate downloading the .apk and installing it off-market. No-one should do this without clear information about the risks involved. This is the **very reason** I am asking the question. Why would I ask the question without a reason?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e54) "you didn't provide any rationale for your question" - This is either the confirmation that I needed that you gave the question nothing but a cursory glance before closing it, or you are trolling. I gave **detailed** rationale in my original post, and I **removed** it **after** you closed the question because it was the only part of the question that was in any way subjective. Look at the edit. I explained clearly why I was interested and removed the explanation - reluctatntly - after you closed the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e55) "I would very much question the idea that security is an exact science" - Well yeah, nothing is an exact science in the simplistic way many people understand the term. Science is incremental, iterative, based on testing hypothesis to discover new questions and refine or replace paradigms. But I think a discussion of the philosophy of science would be off topic... it should be pretty obvious that by exact science, I meant that it involves facts that are falsifiable by evidence rather than interpretations that are subjective.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e56) "I would personally favor closing 3/5 of your examples from other sites". I hope it is obvious by my saying I spent only 5 minutes searching that those weren't intended as examples of great questions. And I hope you can see the reason I posted these: it's very odd, that a site that is supposed to include average Android users should make different demands to serverfault - a site for system administrators. Sites are supposed to be moderated based on clear, publicly stated rules - not the personal whims and feelings of one 20k+ rep guy who others take the lead from.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To conclude: the only reason you gave for closing it as not based on facts or expertise is a) nothing to do with it being not based on facts, b) a personal feeling of yours (off topic, one I actually agree with), c) not true of the original post and d) clearly something you thought of **after** reading my editted question, **after** you had already closed it. What was your **real, original reason** for thinking the original question was subjective? If you only gave the original question a cursory glance, please just admit it. Many modertors make this mistake. Most admit to it when they do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(and as a personal aside, I find it particularly annoying and un-moderator-like that, as well as not reading my question properly the first time, you didn't read it the second time either. If you had, you would have seen my note, **"My original wording of this question went into a bit more detail on why I was interested... Apparently that sort of thing is too subjective. But check the edit if you want more context."**)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"the app is gone, no one can get it from the Market; how can your question be of any future use?" - what if it goes back on the market later, under claims of safety? Its sordid history should be available.


















I've kept an eye on this question to see if the community (via voting, commenting, or answering) held any kind of meaningful opinion on this topic, but since the activity here has been relatively flat I'm going to go ahead and add my thoughts. Please understand that this is solely my opinion on the matter.

The one concern I have with questions of this nature is where factual data would be coming from. Since the app in question is closed-source any truly helpful answer is going to require either:


That the answer reverse-engineers portions of the app, or otherwise attempts to analyze its runtime effects on the system, to determine how it works
Some kind of already existing literature or research that did #1


Because of the nature of proprietary software, any answer that does not involve #1 or #2 is almost certainly going to be speculation or an educated guess. It could very well be an accurate educated guess, but there would be effectively no way for anyone to verify it as such, so the voting largely becomes a matter of "Yeah, that sounds reasonable" or "No, that sounds ridiculous".

On the other hand, I completely understand your motivation and I appreciate the amount of effort and pre-question research you've clearly put into your question. Also, please don't construe my thoughts above as an indication that I think only trivial questions are appropriate for this site - that is certainly not the case at all. Further complicating this is the fact that I do recognize that it is inherently difficult to determine if either points #1 or #2 that I've noted can be met on any given question.

So I suppose a related and slightly more general question could be: Is the answerability of question an acceptable metric for moderation, or no? If so, how do we make that determination? If not, at what point to we draw the line on questions that will attract and/or encourage speculative answers? From what I can tell (and correct me if I'm wrong, anyone) that seems to be the crux of the issue here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...as for that "Too localized" question, I really think the way to see if a community can answer a question is to see if they can answer it. For ANY question, an answer that is speculative will be downvoted. It doesn't matter if it's "I reckon that app's insecure, dunno why" or "Best browser on Android is Firefox, I've never tried the others". People who could contribute useful information include: any developer with knowledge of what it means for an app to repackage another app, anyone who did (or didn't) receive the email mentioned in the post I linked to, any developer/root user who used itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...and out of curiosity looked at the re-packaged apps to see what had changed, anyone who worked on the app, anyone who was or is in contact with the app developers, any developer who has looked into the area and knows what is and isn't possible. Don't forget that a) there was never any suggestion of malice from the app developers, b) lots of people who use this site do have very in-depth knowledge, c) badges like "necromancer" exist for a reason: it's fine for a question to go unanswered for a few months then get a great answer from someone googling the topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Put it another way. Suppose for some reason a person who does have specialist knowledge stumbles on the question in a google search one day. Is there a good reason to stand in their way and say "DON'T ANSWER THIS"? To **physically prevent** this person from answering by closing the question? If it was a duplicate, sure (and redirect them). If it's not about Android, sure. If it's not actually really a question, sure. If it's about a random problem one guy had once because he foolishly went at his phone with a soldering iron, sure. But because it's surprising that someone can answer it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And to put it yet another way, look at this question: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/23664/s2e-link2sd-and-all-other-apps-get-corrupted Like my question, it's specialist, and while there is a closed box element (here, it's limited possible debug info), there are various types of relevant factual knowledge people could have (another cyanogen expert might have experienced similar). Should it be closed? Of course not, someone could answer it, and it causes no harm. So where's the difference? No 29k+ rep moderator had previously closed that question citing unrelated reasons.


















I've not been around for a while, but activity seems very low. Is there a point at which Stackexchange will archive the site, making it read only or are our hosts content to let us sit here and tick over?

Basically: people are interested in Android (hence high hit rate, quite a lot of questions), but this site seems to have a serious problem giving people (including SE people) a reason to stay and interact with the site...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the problem might be that the pool of question askers doesnt overlap very much with the pool of answerers. When the site first opened I had some questions answered, but I've seen very few since that I could answer (to the point where I stopped looking). I'm using SO for work now so will be around more. It's nice to know the site will probably stick around for the time being at least.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If anyone wants to reopen and post their comment above as an answer so I can accept & close, that would be fine

Where can new badges be suggested?

Android Enthusiasts' value mostly comes from people providing (quality) answers.

Immediately (in my opinion) the most natural badge came to my mind but I couldn't find an equivalent:


bronze: answered  100 questions with score x
silver: answered  500 questions with score x
gold:   answered 2500 questions with score x


Name: Problem solver/...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Award badges for a quantity of well-received answersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This site or [Meta SO](http://meta.stackoverflow.com) are probably both fine for suggestions like new badges. The Stack Exchange community managers keep an eye on both, and they're likely the ones that would need to give the suggestion a stamp of approval (well, them and ultimately the devs).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, cool. I then assume it's fine to just keep this question open until some Ops come along.

The page title for individual question pages is formatted:

(tag) - (question title) - Android Enthusiasts

But only when the question has a single tag. I personally just like seeing the question title there, why do single-tagged questions show the tag first, and can and should we change this to be just the question title?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Page  lists single tag first?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This should actually be happening on questions with multiple tags, too. I believe it picks the most "popular" one (the one with the most questions), although perhaps it doesn't do this if all of the tags have very low traffic.


















I've earned both badges over on Stack Overflow, and they did not exist until after I had already exceeded the 3000 rep level and had VTC privileges. There are still a lot of other ways that flags are important, though, and which contribute to your helpful flag count:


Flagging "Not an Answer" posts - If you check the recent posts list regularly you can easily find several per day.
Spam and offensive flags (rarer on this site)
Flagging comments counts toward your total, AFAIK
Anything that warrants an "Other" flag, such as migrations to sites other than SO/Meta.AE, voting irregularities, or other general disturbances.


Also, if you come across a paticularly old post that you really think should be closed (but is unlikely to receive much traffic), I would consider flagging it with the "Other" reason after you have cast a close vote, then briefly explaining your reasoning. Although there are tools available to 10k+ members and mods that show recent close votes, it's easy to neglect them, whereas flags are very prominent. That's probably not going to get you into Deputy/Marshal territory with any kind of speed, though.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5still good to know the options though. Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, this. Actually "flagging" instead of "voting" will make it appear directly in our mod queue, so we'll really take notice of it and choose to do something about it (or not).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not generally a problem here, but on high-traffic sites (read: [so]) flagging _instead_ of using the close/delete votes you have is strongly discouraged. Even here, where there's not nearly as much moderation to be done, you should save your flags for things that _require_ a Moderator, i.e., things that you can't do. Moderators are the exception handlers, not there to cast their supervotes at your behest.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett: I would certainly only recommend flagging (even on this site) if the post is particularly old and unlikely to be closed via regular traffic.


















I tried to answer a question but that was closed during my editing time.

That drove me nuts:

The rich client didn't give me an error when I clicked on 'post your answer'. That did just nothing and occupied me for 10mins (by trying to unformat step-by-step to see if it was a formatting error).
Only until I ctrl-c'ed my answer and reloaded the question I noticed that it had been closed in the meantime.

Can this be changed? To maybe that I'm noticed of the event as soon as it happens?

Used browser: Chromium  18.0.1025.168 (Developer Build 134367) Ubuntu 11.10

PS: If there was a sign indicating the closure it was not big enough to catch my attention.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Question closed during editing an answer, trying to 'post' gives no errorb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmm, there should have been a notification.


















Now that the changes have been live for a while I would tend to agree. The old tag should be a synonym for the new and the tag wiki should very obviously state that the thing wasn't always named that.


  Up until April 2012, the Google Play Store was known as the Android Market and was changed as part of Google's initiative to consolidate their marketplace for Android apps, music, movies, and books.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My only thought on this would be whether or not we should be worried about not having a `market` tag for old/un-updated devices, although I don't even know if that would be truly relevant.


















The https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unlockingunlocking wiki says quite clearly that it is for question about SIM unlocking.

However, there have been a lot of questions recently where the asker has used "unlocking" to refer to getting past the lock screen. I have been fixing the ones I've seen by changing them to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lock-screenlock-screen, but that's not a long-term solution.

Now, I'd be the last person to want to coddle people who don't bother use the many resources that are right in front of them, but we all should know by now that people don't read on the Internet.

I suggest that "unlocking" is too generic a term. Perhaps this would fix it:


Rename https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unlockingunlocking to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sim-unlockingsim-unlocking
Create https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screen-unlockscreen-unlock and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unlock-screenunlock-screen as synonyms to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lock-screenlock-screen. This will guide the user when they start to type "unlock" in the tags field
Be on the lookout for re-creation of the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unlockingunlocking or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unlockunlock tags and rename them to the correct form

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename [unlocking] tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems logical to me, as we also have a `bootloader-lock` tag to help disambiguate between that and screen/SIM locks. `unlocking` is just too vague.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It wouldn't be a bad idea to have a [tag:bootloader-unlock] synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's a good thought, I'll create that as well.


















On other StachExchange sites, you can easily see the Quoted blocks in posts. But on this site they are, because of the white background, hardly visible.

Maybe it should be considered to give them a more darker gray background.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the quote blocks should be more visible on this siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems like a similar question to [Where did OP background color go?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/845/where-did-op-background-color-go) except that I think the quoted code blocks are set to the (marginally) lighter F3F3F£, rather than F6


















I'm just wondering why the chat here is not frequented very well. I'd like to do some chit-chat like asking simple questions to prevent common pitfalls and  all the easy first-timer things that don't belong to meta.  

What should I do? Go to SO's chat and ask there?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where should I ask easy meta questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There should be a chat for MSO, that might not be a bad option.  Or you could browse MSO itself.  We don't really have enough consistently active users to sustain chat well yet, I think.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5or maybe we do but no one gets in because it's always empty :/


















The system basically detected a series of upvotes on your account within a very short timeframe all from a single user. This is not an assessment of your behavior, but rather the behavior of a "fan" that you may have acquired. Similar to targeting a specific user for serial downvoting, serial upvoting is reversed automatically by a script that runs about once a day (IIRC).

The idea here is that it's intended to help prevent sockpuppeting (note that I am not saying that's what you are doing, simply that it is the purpose of the algorithm).

There are also some discussions on MSO that you may find useful. There are https://meta.stackoverflow.com/search?q=serial%20upvotingmore than these few questions, but I think they are the most relevant: 


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/124842/how-to-act-when-youre-being-serial-upvotedHow to act when you're being serial upvoted.

Since they're all coming from one person in such a short period of time then the system automatically "rolls back" those votes because they are not "natural." It's more likely that someone just really likes you :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@t0mm13b: What Bryan said. If you look at your rep history yesterday, you'll see that you received 7 upvotes on 7 different answers from 3:26 to 3:27 (UTC). The assumption the algorithm makes here is that nobody could have read and assessed all of those posts in one minute, so they were not upvoting the content, they were simply upvoting everything they could on your account.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BryanDenny err... your last line made me laugh!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis ok, thanks for the insightful explanation, this answer is marked accepted :)


















Steps:

I spotted 2 remaining spelling errors that I oversaw

You're unlucky :).  One of the devs should see this soon.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matthew Read: As this is just a bug report I it's marginally useful for normal meta users. I assume it's value degrades over time (and becomes null if the devs fix it). (When) Should I vote to delete?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't hurt anything for this to stick around.  If you were able to verify that the issue was fixed or no longer occurs then we could delete it, but in this case I think we need dev confirmation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's time to add a 'status-*' tag to this. 'Oops' errors are automatically reported to the dev's and it's likely already fixed.


















If there is narrow-specific answers that could work on the particular situation but not in the general situation, then the question should stay. If a narrowly-defined answer could have additional information that helps the user better than one written for the general questions in mind, then the question should stay.

For example, an answer to move the app to SD using one of the many standard app2sd methods would be general enough, a link to the general answer would be sufficient; but creating a symbolic links for the cache folders at /foo/bar/myappcache/ would be a narrow answer that have its own merits. If the only reasonable answer is a link to the general question, then the narrow question should be marked as exact duplicate.

There is no need to generalise every single narrow questions; some duplication of this kind is good because people uses different search queries in the search engine and might skip questions whose title are too generic when browsing the search results.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks. Exactly the 'different search queries' is the thing I'm thinking about here. When I search for solutions: Often an answer is already there but to actually find it I have to alter my search terms until I find that one. That's however what most users won't do. So my concern here is exactly this single thing: How to get most people who want that answer to stumble upon it using the most common search queries


















No, no policy on the links. That's just a function of people pasting the URL from their browser. I'd wager most people don't even know that "hl=x" is supposed to be a language hint. (And the rest that do don't notice it.)

So long as the link works without it I don't see a reason why removing it would be a bad thing. It might be too minor if that's all you're looking to change, though.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My personal thought is that international/agnostic links should perhaps be *preferred* when possible. Limiting multilingual links to English seems like it's an unnecessary inconvenience for anyone who speaks English as a second (or third/fourth/etc) language. Edits of that nature seem fine to me, too, provided that any other issues in the post are addressed as you note.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the clarification. I'm only missing 250 to gain "2000 Edit other people’s posts", maybe I'll wait until then to not cause excessive reviews for you guys.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also approve of this. We're an English site but there is no reason to force the language on links to be in English if the site is multi-lingual.


















The https://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/approve-tag-wiki-edits5k privilege mark is kind of a weird privilege, because you can vote on tag wiki edits made by others, but yours still need approval, which seems rather bizarre. The reason the pending edits don't appear is because you cannot approve your own.
AFAIK, you have to hit https://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/trusted-user20k "Trusted User" status in order to edit tag wikis without approval:

What are trusted users?
Trusted users are allowed to perform trusted actions, including:

Voting to delete answers with score of -1 or lower
Voting to undelete answers except those deleted by a moderator
Voting to delete questions immediately after they are closed (even if they are new)
Editing all tag wikis on the site


So from my understanding this is /questions/tagged/status-bydesignstatus-bydesign. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/108285/150283An answer from waffles (e.g. Sam Saffron) on Meta.SO appears to confirm this.

Go ahead and put [meta-tag:status-bydesign] on this question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pretty much all of the tag privileges require a weirdly high amount of rep.  Makes it hard for a lot of things regarding tags to be done by anyone except moderators.


















Android devices don't have "disks". As such, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/low-disk-spacelow-disk-space should be a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/internal-storageinternal-storage.

The latter is for all issues dealing with internal storage, not just its lack.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please make "low-disk-space" a synonym for "internal storage"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm inclined to agree with the merge, I don't think it's possible to specialize in solving low space issues / errors so the tag doesn't create a useful category.  I'll wait to see if anyone else has thoughts though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My only comment is that I believe the status bar warning Android gives you does use the text "Low disk space" on some (all?) devices, although I don't necessarily think that's a compelling enough reason to keep the tag around.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A good reason for keeping it as a synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with the merge and keeping the synonym since the OS does do as @eldareathis says


















Both underscores and asterisks work for italics, it has nothing at all to do with the button.  Basically you've confused the parser that converts the Markdown to HTML.

You have to escape the underscore with a backslash: *kernel\_config.gz*

Which shows as: kernel_config.gz

It seems to me most of the questions using https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/storagestorage would be better using https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/internal-storageinternal-storage. Those that don't usually talking about the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sd-cardsd-card.

Can anyone see why the two shouldn't be synonymed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"storage" should probably be a synonym for "internal-storage"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That seems logical to me. I'm wondering now how we should tag things about devices that don't have a physical SD card slot (GNex, for example), though. `sd-card` seems a bit confusing, but `internal-storage` could also be a little weird if talking about USB file transfers (though, really, it *is* internal storage I suppose).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I know what you mean.


















I noticed that we apparently have a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gmail-synchronizationgmail-synchronization tag, and I'm considering deleting it and retagging the ~20 questions currently using it. It seems to me that there is no need for this tag as any questions can be adequately covered by simply using https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gmailgmail and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/syncsync in tandem, rather than creating a compound tag for this, which is something of an anomaly at the moment (i.e. do we create tags like this for every sync-able data feature?).

However, I'm also a little concerned that perhaps there is something unique about the way Gmail syncs it's data which I am perhaps not aware of, so I wanted to pose this question before doing anything. Is there a reasonable use for this tag that I am overlooking, which the other two do not fulfill? Should this tag be kept?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we need the 'gmail-synchronization' tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think gmail and sync separately would be fine. I don't think there is anything special about gmail-sync (it just syncs with the cloud... nothing special about it).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah the only thing unique is how often it screws up :P.  Your proposal sounds fine to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Heh! I suppose am to blame for editing the gmail-synchronization tag :P But yeah, there is a lot of tags in there that has no descriptions or has 0 followers (am seeing some on SO, and some are not even needed...) and duly reject them...


















About two days ago, I was editing a tag wiki.
When submitting, an error appeared, but dumb-ass-me, I didn't pay attention and just pressed the available button.

Was something about an error that had occurred, but that I shouldn't worry because it had been logged and someone was going to deal with it.

Anyway, since then I can't propose any tag-wiki suggestion. Seems like the Propose Tag Wiki is hidden for my user.

Can someone enlighten me on this subject?

Ps:
The Edit Tag Wiki also doesn't appear.

Summary

Following up as to why did I have so many rejected edits I've started to analyze all suggestions that I've made to find the ones rejected and try to learn from the mistake committed.

What brought me here is the fact that I've committed no mistakes whatsoever. The reason behind the rejection of my edit suggestions was invalid and unsubstantiated.

Eight edits have been rejected with the following claim:


  There's no questions tagged with this, it has no reason to exist


But after analyzing each one of them and performed a search for questions with those tags, feels like I've paid the price for someone else's "mistake", after all, questions exist for each one of the tags edited:


Got prevented from editing during 7 days.
My record for future edits shows poor editing skills.
I've wasted a Sunday afternoon instead of invested it to the community.


I'm asking what can be done to set the records strait on this one?

For future reference, it would probably be more helpful to all if tag wikis were created for popular tags that don't have them.

I was the person who rejected those, though from memory you had a queue of about 20 suggested edits on that morning and I'm pretty sure I approved at least half of them. It stuck in my mind because that was an awful lot of edit suggestions from one person, and some of them were very long.

I'm sorry if I caused any offence by this, one reason I didn't pick any of the default rejection reasons but instead wrote out a custom one explaining why I'd rejected them was so that you could see why I'd done it.


  There's no questions tagged with this, it has no reason to exist


That was my comment as I rejected those edits.

From memory all of your edits were creating new Tag Wiki's and Tag Wiki Excerpts. The very first thing I do when I see a tag wiki edit of any kind in the queue is click the tag, read through the questions currently tagged with that tag, and then come back and see if the wiki edit suggestion seems to match the intent of the questions.

When I clicked through the tags you've highlighted above I honestly couldn't see any questions tagged with them. In a couple of cases, because it did look odd to be submitting so many tag wiki's for non-existent tags, as well as clicking through to the tag and going through the tabs (newest, faq, votes, active, unanswered) I also ran searches for the [tag name] on the site, and still couldn't see any questions tagged with those tags.

Looking now, there definitely are questions tagged with the tags you point out, and if you re-submitted your edits, I wouldn't reject them again. As to what happened on the day, I genuinely couldn't find any questions using those tags, which means that anything in them will be automatically deleted by the StackExchange engine. However when I look at the edit dates on those questions, a lot of them had the tag in question added before I serached for it, which is odd, and I can't explain what's happened there.

I don't know what happened there, and I'm sorry if I caused you any offence, but as far as I could see at the time what I said was true when I looked, and I can't explain why what I was seeing was different from what you saw.

On July 15, I've suggested 12 edits, you've approved [this](http://android.stackexchange.com/suggested-edits/1565), [this](http://android.stackexchange.com/suggested-edits/1566), [this](http://android.stackexchange.com/suggested-edits/1559) and [this](http://android.stackexchange.com/suggested-edits/1560). (one-third got approved) :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be clear, no offence was taken, I've just "complained" due to the -x on my profile. When I'm performing any type of action on any SE site, I try to be as productive as possible, and accept being "punished" when I'm not on the top of my game. This was not the case, hence the reason for my question here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do price the person whose integrity cannot be questioned, and your answer proves this much! +1 :)


















While writing https://android.stackexchange.com/suggested-edits/1597this suggested edit I wondered if we should create two tags:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-musicgoogle-music
For questions about the App
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-musicgoogle-play-music For questions about the Google's Play Music store/service


or

should we handle both type of questions within the same tag and create a new synonym https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-musicgoogle-play-music for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-musicgoogle-music. Since sometimes questions will be related to both topics.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have google-music and google-play-music tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm a little on the fence about this. My inclination is actually to retag everything with `google-play-music` since there is no longer a service or app named `google-music`. The app *does* identify itself as "Play Music" on your device, so tagging it with something else could be confusing.


















Well, this is part-and-parcel of https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/943/change-the-primary-tag-for-certain-google-renamed-servicesChange the primary tag for certain Google renamed services? I suppose this question is probably a duplicate.

The app  recently had its name changed to Google Play Music, so I think the tag for that should be https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-musicgoogle-play-music. The store/service is really https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-store-musicgoogle-play-store-music but do we really want questions tagged with that? https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-storegoogle-play-store seems like it should suffice.

Answer it, it is almost certain that you're not the only person experiencing the issue, and other people might have the same problem that will be helped by knowing that the issue is fixed in the newer version, that will convince them to update or at least they may be able to find a workaround after knowing the nature of the problem. Make sure to include the version info of the buggy software and the version that fixed the problem.

I recently changed my GTK theme to http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Zenburnzenburn and noticed that while on meta.stackoverflow the background color is preserved:

I flagged https://android.stackexchange.com/a/27458/14562this answer as not an answer because it doesn't address the question asked. My flag was disputed. A lengthy discussion in the comments has ensued, but the answer is clearly off-topic and should be converted into a comment.

My main concern is that the answer has collected a few upvotes (and my downvote), which puts it near the threshold for a question to be automatically considered answered by the system, even though it is very much not answered. (The other answer might be the solution, but I don't know yet.) I'd hate to see the system gamed, and I don't understand why my original flag would have been disputed in the first place.

What is the proper action to take in this case? Should I re-flag the answer with my rationale? Is this meta post the proper way?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Under what circumstances should an off-topic answer be retained?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question clearly addresses the "proximity sensor" -- though this doesn't solve the OPs problem. So the answer refers to what the OP asked -- though he obviously didn't ask what he probably intends to get. So technically speaking, it's a valid answer IMHO. Granted, it first confused me as well. The second half of this answer then clearly takes the right direction.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, this question is now moot, as the answer in question has been deleted by the owner.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...although I suppose the generic question it raises would be good to keep.


















Android Stack Exchange gets more than its fair share of "drive by" posters. I don't know that that will ever change.

As for what to do, I think you've been doing the right thing. But I'll reiterate:


Answer the ones you can answer
Downvote the crappy or uninteresting ones
Vote to close the really bad ones, especially if the problem described was fixed by a long-ago update


Remember: The Questions and their Answers aren't just for the person asking the question, but for future readers as well. A question with good answers is a good thing to have, even if the original asker will never return. On the other hand, questions that no one cares about, not even to answer or vote up, aren't useful to anyone. That's why they're automatically deleted after some time. Six months, if memory serves; four weeks is too short a time.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First thank you for your answer -- I guess I was a bit unclear in one point: Some question are really interesting ones -- but in order to answer them, they'd need just a piece of feedback from the OP, which is impossible because of his absence-without-return. So those questions cannot be answered -- but still are neither off-topic nor ambiguous or whatever-reason-to-close. The only thing I could think of here is to flag them for "moderator attention", which I don't want to abuse.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the question can't be answered without some other piece of information from the OP, that information has been asked for, and a reasonable amount of time has passed for the OP to provide it, then vote-to-close/flag it as "Not a Real Question". "This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and cannot be reasonably answered in its current form."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks -- that's a word. I already left the question for missing information on some of them (which not already had it). Remains the question to define the "reasonable amount of time": 2 weeks? 3..4 weeks?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Use your best judgment. I say two weeks is more than enough time for the OP to provide more information. I regularly trawl the questions with close votes and open flags lists. If someone doesn't agree with your vote-to-close they'll just ignore it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, thanks again -- I'll go with that. Though I'm afraid most people might "ignore" those old ones, and thus my "vote-to-close" would die of loneliness. So should they be flagged additionally -- or would that rather look "offending"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I won't speak for the Moderators (because I'm not one any more) but in general you should only flag things that _require_ a Moderator's attention. (Moderators are a site's Exception Handlers.) Since you have enough rep to vote-to-close you should do that. Don't worry about your votes "aging away"; that'll only happen if a bunch of people who can also cast close votes see the question and don't vote themselves. On the other hand, you could go ahead and flag all you want; there's no requirement that a Mod has to act on your flag. If they disagree with too many though you'll lose the ability.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK -- got it. Btw: Is there any way to explicitly *check* for questions having close-/reopen-votes? As this could help to bring things to attention (you said you "regularly trawl the questions with close votes", so I take it there is a way to do so I did not yet find).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's part of the 10K+ tools.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, coming :) Tnx!


















Personally, I care less for the OP presence or concern with its own question. I always view questions on a large perspective, and for a Q&A site, one user asks a question, but millions may benefit from the answers.

It all comes down to the question itself, and its contents:

If the question concerns a problem regarding the OS, a device or the configuration of something, the question and provided answers will most definitely help future visitors.

On the other hand, if the question concerns a specific application, will be useful on its current timeline, future users will be using a newer version of said app, thus not benefiting from the old question and its answers.

Examples:


A question about the app Android System Info, concerning an issue with version 1.17.1, if it's not answered, I don't believe anyone will benefit from an answer today, since the current version is 1.22.0.
A question about the Android OS, whatever version it is, will always benefit future visitors. Since certain devices can't go beyond a specific version and even today users have devices working with earlier versions of Android.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Understood -- and that is how I try to evaluate it: the former I vote to close (or flag them), the latter I try to answer or see whether to upvote an existing answer. So far it's clear. But if it's not clear, and a little more information could help -- but as said, the OP does (and will) never provide it? And I'm not speaking about "ambiguous" questions, which again would be a "clear" case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's not necessarily true that no one will benefit from questions about older versions of apps. Some of those self-same people stuck on older versions of the OS may not be able to upgrade to the newer version of the app. It is a vanishingly small number, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy If the question doesn't contain enough information to allow users answer it, and OP isn't seen for months or years, one can check if it's active on another SE site, since it will get a notification for comments on its question. If not, well, there's nothing one can do...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett True, but if an application was developed to a earlier version of Android, one expects that future upgrades will continue to support that version. This is a generic concept, may not apply of course.


















It seems to me that the answer you refer to is trying to answer the question behind your question. It is, at least, an attempt to answer some aspect of your question. By and large, Moderators are going to be conservative about deleting answers; they'll only do so if it is an obvious non-answer.

Frankly, I think your question is off-topic. Certainly it's not an Android-specific issue.

All that considered, it's the community that decides. You've received an answer and you've commented that you don't think it is and your rationale. That's good. The community seems to not agree. Re-flagging in hopes of getting a Moderator to issue a different decision is a little disingenuous.

That you've raised the issue here on Meta is fine, as any discussion that can help improve the site is welcome.

A new system for https://android.stackexchange.com/reviewreviewing posts that require moderation is now live here at Android Enthusiasts.

For details, please see https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/139536/new-feature-community-review-tasks-now-in-betathe post on Meta Stack Overflow.

It's important to note that this is not (necessarily) a tool for Community Moderators. It's a tool to help the Community moderate itself. Please check it out and lend a hand.

If you have issues and questions, please post them on https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reviewMeta Stack Overflow, not here. (Be sure to use the "review" tag as well.)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5New Review system currently in beta testingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh nice! Thanks for pointing this out!


















This is a new and interesting feature that allows users to spend less effort while doing their part to this community network.

The new feature, as any other feature comes with potential bad habits that one may get caught in without noticing.

Some that I've noticed across SE are:


Clicker happy

Experienced users or new users all get involved in such a way that may forget about the real purpose of the review area. Take you time, analyze what you are reviewing:

https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/140017/184576Is there an actual “accept ALL the suggested edits” problem?
The usage for competition

One interesting part of the new review is that we are able to view who's the top reviewer, what position are we in, and even compare decisions by looking at the review history.



This serves the purpose of providing users a way to improve themselves and refrain from committing mistakes, by learning with others.

It is not the Olympic Games, there's no fat payment for the first place, so, don't go voting just because! Vote and review always with the community shirt on.
Exaggerated point of view

One may get addicted, and as any addiction, there are side effects. If you're tired of seeing what you consider bad answers or bad questions, take a break from review, use the chat to exchange ideas, post a question at META to clarify you point of view.

Remember the famous: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/9953/184576Could we please be a bit nicer to new users?

Don't spend your precious time reviewing just to feel tired and saturated.




I'm answering this as to illustrate some of the frequent problems I see on the several SE sites, being discussed on META, and even some that I've personally experienced and/or have been confronted by. Feel free to improve it.

I had no idea there was that much _crap_ on here. 2. Who the hell upvotes this stuff?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett New users tend to leave low quality posts, and the same goes for their perspective regarding what's a good Q or A to upvote :) *Today I found one answer written in French :D*


















Hangout at chat when this appeared:



https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/27619/access-email-configuration-from-own-appThe question was migrated to Stackoverflow, but yet, it was presented at Android Enthusiasts News Feed.

Is it supposed to be? I mean, why something that got off Android would be interesting to Android users?



I noticed that the link still points to Android, perhaps this was presented because the question suffered a status update?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should a migrated question to another SE site, be a part of the News feed at Android-SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, it shouldn't. But I expect it's just a timing/cache issue. It was probably queued up as part of the feed before it was migrated.

Where is the Play Store on device X?

Is a recurring type of question related to different devices but mostly caused by the same reason which can be answered the same way.


See if you can root the device;
If root then:


If possible: Install Google Framework .apk;
If not possible: Install ROM (if exists) with Google Framework.




The questions which could be closed as duplicates of the new to create meta question, maybe marked as cw, are:


https://android.stackexchange.com/q/23877/16265Google Play on a Samsung Galaxy Ace
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/24768/16265Does China Mobile Galaxy S3 model GT I-9308 have Google Play Store?
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/13081/16265Installing official Google Marketplace on a chinese Asus Eee Pad Transformer 101
(add more if you spot them)


What do you think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we install a universal question for "Where is the Play Store on ?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are quite a few similar to this relating to the Kindle Fire.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SaintWacko Feel free to edit my post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright, I can't get to it at the moment, but I'll try to add the list in when I get a chance.


















In my opinion, this is a fine idea for a "cannonical question". It does come up rather regularly and the solution is generically the same regardless of the device (root, install a Google apps package and/or a ROM that includes them).

My suggestion would be for the question to be entitled something like "Google Play is not pre-installed on my device, is there a way for me to install it?"
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm in perfect agreement here. I don't think we need a question for every device.


















I personally like questions about data recovery, post mortem analyses and generally pushing some security limits (e.g. to access personal data, crack/circumvent forgotten passphrases, retrieving data from half broken devices and so on). It had many (good!) uses for me and some of my friends in the past.

The general information on how to do X is neutral, however it cannot be guaranteed that it is used with benign intentions only. To boot, all information is freely accessible here too so benign ambitions of the OP or not, there'll be readers that will misuse it eventually.

Should these questions be answered and how? What in case the intentions are unclear? It's somewhat like the old discussion about full-disclosure or not.

Got a bit surprised by finding the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jailbreakjailbreak, that by definition:


  process of removing the limitations imposed by Apple on devices running the iOS operating system through the use of hardware/software exploits...


See the Wikipedia article regarding http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreakingjailbreaking

While a jargon expression, it is strictly associated with iOS devices. For Android devices, the jargon is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_%28Android_OS%29"Rooting".

This terms exist and essentially mean the same thing, but each one is specific to a different device type using a different software. At Android Enthusiasts, we deal with only one type, Android, but yet we have three questions sitting on the main site since 2010 tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jailbreakjailbreak:


https://android.stackexchange.com/q/876/16265Is it possible to completely brick your Android phone by using a Custom ROM?
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/847/16265(how) can I install android on an iphone 4? [closed]
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/801/16265What is the difference between jailbreaking and unlocking an Android? [closed]


Two of the three questions already have https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rootingrooting

While two of the three questions are closed, one remains open and the tag remains active. Whether the questions are useful or not, that's another topic, what I'm discussing is:

Is it good to have a tag that's specificity directed to a non-android device? If not, should it be burninate and/or blacklisted, or by popular demand, merge and create a synonym?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we burninate the jailbreak tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Burnination seems like overkill for a tag that's only on three questions. Best to just remove it from those questions and let the tag auto-delete. If it keeps coming back we can reconsider.


















I suggest simply making the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jailbreakjailbreak a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rootingrooting. This way users who try to use the tag are automatically pointed to the right term/tag.

In the effort to "clean" the unanswered questions (credits to all of you), one bumps into questions already answered by the querist, either within the question body, or in the comments below. Some examples are:

The summary of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/27277/why-my-phone-battery-has-four-terminal-what-is-the-use-of-the-fourththis question is:


  I have a LG Optimus One (P500). For sometime I am wondering why my phone's battery has four terminals.


I don't think this question is related to Android at all. Even my 7 years old Motorola phone running Java based OS has similar battery.

This question is similar to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/21137/difference-between-armv6-armv7-processorsthis question and looks like its going to be closed any moment.

Why hasn't the question been closed but rather received so many up-votes?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why isn't this question closedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5maybe it caught interest for "what's the 4th connector good for spedifically with Android" (answer maybe: NFC antenna, might as well be related to [this](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/25480/why-is-the-nfc-in-the-galaxy-nexus-battery) one)


















It's got two Close votes at the moment.

Why is it getting upvoted? This is the perpetual meta question on just about all of the Stack Exchange sites. This on-topic Q&A stuff is hard.

(For what it's worth, I'd already voted to close both of those.)

It's not a bad question per se, just not quite on topic for us.

However it's also not fully off-topic (there is an Android hardware element to it) and it does have a pretty well written question and informative, well-written answers.

Personally I haven't voted to close it, I don't think it's doing any harm and is interesting and informative for people who are interested in how their device works.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. It's a grey area kind of question. At the least, it is interesting and related to Android.


















Seems like something is gone wrong:

I don't know, whereas https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screenscreen and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/displaydisplay were really just different ways of saying the same thing,and were proper synonyms. These all seem like specific cases where a specific aspect or behaviour is being asked about. I think people are likely to search for "screen timeout" or "screen brightness" so these are useful tags.

Though as the one question in Screensaver makes clear, that whole idea just doesn't make sense in Android at the moment, so it's debatable whether we need that tag at all. But if things like Android x86 take off and we start seeing Android in more devices like desktop-style machines, or when Android is running devices with expensive screens that are permanently connected to the mains power, like TVs, set top boxes and Ouyas then screensavers could become a real thing for Android in the future.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm with GAThrawn on this. screen-timeout and screen-brightness are in no wise the same thing. "screensaver" should just be removed from that question and allowed to die; it doesn't have any context on Android.


















(Possibly related to https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333/upgrade-adviceUpgrade Advice?; not really I reckon.)

Is it appropriate here to ask questions about how a particular Android device will look/behave and what features it will have added/removed in case I upgrade from Android X.X to Y.Y? Not looking for a complete list compiled for me, just specific features listed in the question.

My rationale: Because one can't, without rooting the device and doing other things, go back to the Android version one had before the upgrade, I'm not exactly jumping up and down to install the newest version available from the manufacturer. I lurk on youtube for videos that feature the upgraded phone, I read articles and reviews, but when I can't find answers to a particular worry, I would really appreciate advice from a person who has already upgraded that same device.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Question about upgrade experience for a specific deviceb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are you referring solely to stock ROM updates?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would say so. The ones that are available from the device manufacturer, not unsupported ones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"What is your experience" type questions are usually best off in the chatroom, if you can find someone who has done what you're thinking of doing you can actually have a proper back-and-forth there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect example just posted: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/28818/what-changed-from-cyanogenmod-9-0-to-9-1


















It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now).

However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update.

I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems too localized to me, especially when talking about one particular device. I mean, they do publish the changelogs for each version.


















Think of a hierachical tag structure/scenario. Currently it's not possible to model an "is a" hierachical relation between tag subclasses and their parents. 

A good example are the browsers that are available for Android and the following tags for it:

browser
├── chrome-for-android
├── dolphin-browser
├── firefox
├── opera #virtual, doesn't really exist yet
│   ├── opera-mini
│   └── opera-mobile
└── stock-browser


Currently I need to look for each of the available tags to get all results, i.e. the generic browser doesn't list every browser-relevant questions.

How should this be handled:
Should each subtag also be accompanied by its parent tags? (e.g. browser, opera, opera-mobile instead of only opera-mobile). 

EDIT: I'm not suggesting to add an 'opera-browser' tag here, it's just to take the example to the extremes for better illustration only.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How should hierachical tags be handled?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Somewhat related: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/45438/a-proposal-for-tag-hierarchy-on-sob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5thanks! read through it already in parallel. A hierarchy of tags has it's obvious downsides... and obviously is really not needed here. So just asking for  your opinion on tagging.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`browser` is kind of a sticky tag since the vast majority of Android devices simply name their default browser "Browser". I imagine many uses of this tag refer not to "browsers" as a general concept but rather to the *specific* Browser app (though we also have a `stock-browser` tag). However, I can certainly see plenty of situations where `browser` as a generic tag isn't necessary - what if the question truly is specific to, say, Firefox? Tagging with `browser` seems somewhat misleading.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5additionally: browser and stock-browser will be dependant on the Android version, as JB's stock has changed to Chrome for Androidb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Specifically on the the `browser` front, see also http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/899/synonymize-web-browser-and-browsers-with-browser


















If there are tag slots left, tag it with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/browserbrowser and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chrome-for-androidchrome-for-android. If there are no slots left, just use https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chrome-for-androidchrome-for-android.

I saw some edits here that removed the "parent tags". E.g. if something was tagged with

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/usbusb, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tetheringtethering https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/usb-tetheringusb-tethering, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/somethingelsesomethingelse

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/usbusb and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tetheringtethering was removed. IMHO this is counterproductive. As long as the removed tags are not replaced with some better/important tag(s), just leave it as it is.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a reason to tag something (per your example) with `usb`, `tethering` **and** `usb-tethering`? What benefit does that provide? It seems like using the more specific tag would be preferable since it would logically "group" the question with other ones about USB tethering and *not* with ones about unrelated USB functions (file transfers, charging, etc).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5More specific tags are better. Generally fewer tags are better; if you regularly run up against the five tag limit and would add more tags if you could, perhaps your question is not as focused as it could be. As it is, each tag on a question should be able to stand on its own.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that more specific tags are better. But it doesn't hurt to have also the parent/general tag, *if it doesn't consume space for another more important tag*. This enables for example to search for all questions regarding browsers and a device, which would not be possible if the browser tag had been removed. I know that this breaks the "stands on its own" rule, but I see no advantage from this rule.


















Checking our tags for missing descriptions (tag-wiki), I came across above mentioned tags:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chargingcharging with the synonyms https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chargercharger and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/battery-chargingbattery-charging
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-managementpower-management (no synonym) with the synonym https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/battery-managerbattery-manager
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower (no synonym)


Questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower are either belonging to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chargingcharging or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-managementpower-management. So my suggestion would be to check all questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower, and re-tag those to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chargingcharging which rather belong there (I volunteer doing this, if the overall task/concept is agreed on) . After that, converting the tag https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower into a synonym to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-managementpower-management.

I still miss the rep for some tasks involved (e.g. converting a tag into a synonym, or even propose it such) -- but as said, I'd volunteer for the re-tagging part.

While on it: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-optionspower-options (3 questions altogether) should either be "dropped" (by re-tagging those 3 questions), or simply be made a synonym to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-managementpower-management -- which is what those 3 questions relate to.

Opinions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags power/power-management plus charger/chargingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good, though "power-options" and plain "power" probably just need burninating, once their questions have been retagged. Anyone typing "power" into the tag box should get the right tags suggested straight away, and if there's no tag then there's less encouragement to use it!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed :) Just let me know if there's anything I should do. Shall I retag those 3 (power-options->power-management)? Will the "empty tag" then be removed automatically (it finally will, but when?) and thus no longer pop-up in the tag box?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, I know "bump" is not a nice word -- but as it looks like we somehow agreed, but nothing happened: Might I ask how to proceed with those?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just notice: The "power*" part already has an (also still open) request here: [Tag merge: power, power-management, power-options](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/1229/tag-merge-power-power-management-power-options)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Half a year is a long time, so some things have changed in the meantime; new questions tagged 'power-options' raise the question this tag might address the menu popping up on long-pressing the power button, so it might make sense (after cleanup and re-tagging).


















I recently asked a question about https://android.stackexchange.com/q/27586/4229why I couldn't see error messages logged from K9 using aLogcat on Jelly bean.

The https://android.stackexchange.com/a/27587/4229only answer instead answered a different question (i.e. "How do I fix these errors with K9?") so after waiting a while for an update, I flagged it as not an answer.

My flag was rejected with the reason: declined - "Not an answer" flags are for posts that are not even attempts to answer.

A moderator then commented: Perhaps you should have asked that, we generally prefer questions that don't presuppose a solution.

These are not necessarily related, but overall this all seems to be rather poor form to me. I've certainly never seen this sort of reaction on any other stack exchange site I've used regularly. When I ask a question I want an answer to that question, not the question that someone thought I should have asked.

I don't blame the answerer for trying, in good faith, to answer the question he may have thought I was asking, but to clarify the question, still not get an answer and then be told by a moderator that I shouldn't have asked that question in the first place is a double blow.

So, should a moderator decline a "not an answer" flag just because they think that you asked the wrong question, even if the answer did not in fact answer your question?

If so, then why has Android Enthusiasts decided to disregard what is considered stack exchange best practice, as detailed in https://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/2011/09/september-2011-newsletter/Flags Too Often Marked [declined]?

If the post looks like it's an attempt to answer the question, a Moderator will should leave it.

The way to handle incorrect or misguided answer is to do any or all of the following:


downvote it
leave a comment explaining why it's wrong or answering the wrong question
updating your question to be more clear

The problem is, while there is an incorrect answer, it looks like the question is answered, discouraging further answers.


















Still going over the tags, I just stumbled upon https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/angry-birdsangry-birds (x13) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/angry-birds-spaceangry-birds-space (x2). I'd suggest to make the spacy chickens a synonym to their earth-bound companions.

Another "merge-and-synonym" request: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/car-modecar-mode (x1) should IMHO be merged into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/car-dockcar-dock (x9) and made a synonym to it (makes together 10 questions).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge "car-mode" to "car-dock" tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm an Android dev specifically in regards to car mode and car docks. They are not equivalent. A Car Dock holds the phone and *may* put the phone into Car Mode due to pin connectors/magnets on the phone/dock. However, you can start Car Mode without a Car Dock. So the two are related, but I don't see a good reason to merge them.


















Another candidate for merging: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chat-historychat-history is used by only 2 questions (both times together with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-talkgoogle-talk). Then there's https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chatchat, used 7 times.

Suggestion: Merge https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chat-historychat-history into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chatchat and either make the former a synonym to the later, or simply drop it. Though in the latter case it might pop-up again if we just wait for the emptied tag to be auto-purged ;)

Same goes for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cloud-storagecloud-storage (x1), which should be merged into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cloudcloud (x14 currently).

Just found the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware tag (x38), where questions mostly refer to either https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/romrom (x78) or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/custom-romcustom-rom (x141).

Suggestion:


remove the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware from those questions already tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/custom-romcustom-rom
merge https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/romrom
make https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware a synonym to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/romrom


Though there's one more thing to consider: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware may be ambiguous, as it could as well refer to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/radio-firmwareradio-firmware (x6). How do we deal with ambiguous tags in general, and especially in this case?

EDIT: as per suggestion from GAThrawn (to check https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/887/whats-the-intended-purpose-of-the-radio-tagWhat's the intended purpose of the 'radio' tag?), those questions relating to radio-firmware and radio-firmware itself could be merged into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cellular-radiocellular-radio in this process.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge firmware and rom?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While not quite the same thing, I can't help thinking that some of the ROM/Custom-ROM/Firmware thing also overlaps with the Stock/Vanilla Android tags: http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/428/merge-stock-stock-android-vanilla-define-stock-android Also see Radio http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/887/whats-the-intended-purpose-of-the-radio-tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn The radio tag does no longer exist (stated in the linked meta). Following that, radio-firmware should be merged to [tag:cellular-radio] then. As for stock etc.: Looks like the outcome of my suggestion meets the results from there, as far as I understand it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess this got obsolete due to [Rename the 'firmware' tag to 'device-firmware' and make 'firmware' a synonym](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/1410/16575), and thus should be closed (alternatively: `status-declined` :)


















Again two synonymous tags: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hotspothotspot (x11) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wifi-hotspotwifi-hotspot (x37). While it is clear that all wifi-hotspots are hotspots, also all questions tagged "hotspot" relate to Wifi (many of them are even additionally tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wifiwifi). As already said, "hotspot" and "tethering" are different issues (https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/132/wifi-tags-are-wifi-tethering-and-wifi-hotspot-redundantwifi tags - are wifi-tethering and wifi-hotspot redundant?), but IMHO this does not apply here.

Suggestion:


merge https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hotspothotspot with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wifi-hotspotwifi-hotspot
optionally: If someone thinks there are (or could be) non-wifi hotspots, add the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wifiwifi tag to the merged items from "wifi-hotspot"
make "wifi-hotspot" a synonym to "hotspot"

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge wifi-hotspot and hotspot tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Makes sense to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Include the "optional" step? There certainly won't be a "bluetooth-hotspot" for technical reasons (AFAIK bluetooth would always be 1:1), but who can tell about NFC (LOL: "Come together"), or what the future might bring?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with the idea of merging `hotspot` with `wifi-hotspot` as they're entirely redundant, but I'm not quite sure how I feel about which way to do the merge. Part of me thinks `hotspot` is clear enough, but if every question will also carry around the `wifi` tag then using `wifi-hotspot` seems like it would be less clunky (and still allow for future theoretical tags of the form `x-hotspot` where 'x' is some communication form).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is also covered by the fact that `wifi-hotspot` is used almost 4 times as often as `hotspot`, so I second it. It's a 2:1 -- `hotspot` seems sufficient to me as well, but `wifi-hotspot` is much more frequently used, plus allows for the future `x-hotspot`s.


















Similar issue, but possibly other rules apply: I just encountered the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/motorolamotorola tag (30 questions). Many of the questions tagged with this additionally have a specific device tag applied (e.g. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/motorola-droidmotorola-droid or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/motorola-milestonemotorola-milestone -- or even both, making it double-obsolete (see: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1076/should-we-merge-the-motorola-droid-and-motorola-milestone-tagsShould we merge the motorola-droid and motorola-milestone tags?).

So basically I could understand "motorola" being a fall-back if your Motorla device does not yet have an own tag. But if it has, is it really necessary to triple-tag it? Should we remove the obsolete ones here?

To pick up Flows scheme here:

motorola
├── motorola-droid            (CDMA)
|   └── motorola-milestone    (GSM/UMTS variant)
├── motorola-droid-2          (CDMA)
|   └── motorola-milestone-2  (GSM/UMTS variant)
├── motorola-droid-3
...
[ sony ]                      (no such tag -- yet)
├── [ sony-xperia ]           (no such tag -- yet)
|   ├── sony-xperia-arc
|   ├── sony-xperia-neo
...


Looking at that: There seems no such "fallback" for Sony devices. But we again have it for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htchtc and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsungsamsung, don't have it for "acer" or "archos"... So how to deal with those hierarchies?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"motorola" shouldn't be a "fall-back" tag. If there's a device-specific question it should have a tag for that device. "motorola" should be for questions about Motorola devices _in general_.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, but in that case it makes absolutely no sense to tag a question "motorola", "motorola-droid" *and* "motorola-milestone" -- only one of these tags should be used. And if there's a tag for "Motorola devices in general": Do we need the same for Sony devices as well? They also have their particularities (UI, headphone-connector specifics, ...). And how about Acer and others? Or maybe that's a different question I should ask separately?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't worry much about whether or not we "should" have tags for given topics. If a question comes up where it seems appropriate to use a generic `sony` tag then it can be added.


















The difference between GSM and CDMA phones is pretty major.  I'm not sure that synonymizing them makes sense despite their other similarities.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have always been referred to the *Droid 2* on most forums (except for specific stuff or ROMs to flash, for good reason as you mentioned). I could check how many of the 30 *Milestone* questions wouldn't fit in the *droid* section. Let me quote Al Everett: *People are using tags to describe their device and not the question.* ([Merge stock, stock-android, vanilla](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/428/))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5besides one being CDMA and the other being GSM, they are basically the same otherwise. I think they should be merged and synonym'd. If not, then there is an argument for having tags for samsung-galaxy-s-vibrant, samsung-galaxy-s-captivate, samsung-galaxy-s-fascinate. While these devices are all Galaxy S devices, they are very different. And there are TONS of Galaxy S III variants. using the gsm or cdma tag along with the device tags would be useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy IMO that quote supports leaving them separate.  If there's no question-determined reason to use a device tag then it should be left off; if there is, then it should be specific to the device and not a class if devices unless it is *known* to apply to that class.  Ryan, we do have tags for specific SGS variations (or did last time I checked) and they've come in handy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead I guess we do have specific SGS tags...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see 3 SGS specific tags out of the 20 SGS incarnations around the world. Do you really want to tag for every one of them? IMHO this should be decided on a per device base. And for the Droid/Milestone it's IMHO to merge them. I don't see the a major difference in the GSM and CDMA versions. Maybe you could elaborate the difference a little bit more?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow If they are warranted, tags aren't created for no reason.  I don't see a compelling reason to merge them, is there one?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5most users that have a Droid are not going to know that it is called a Milestone everywhere else, so for that I can see a reason not to merge them. With that said, they are the same device minus the different types of networks they are used on.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So let the "droid" be the master, and "milestone" its synonym. Typing "milestone" would reveal it, and I guess at least half of the milestone users know it's called "Droid" in the US. Another reason for the merge: The device is pretty outdated meanwhile, and already had 3 successors. I just replaced my Milestone-2 :)


















Same hardware, just the radio module is different. Let's merge the tags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5May I rise this question again? Merge 'milestone-2' (3 questions only, and not even GSM specific) to 'droid-2' and make the former a synonym? If a question would be GSM specific, we still have the 'gsm' tag to be used in addition (as we have 'cdma', before one needs to check ;)


















Clearly some of the "tasks" questions need re-tagging.

I'm not convinced, though, that "tasks" should be a synonym of "to-do". That Android has "task managers" and "task killers" strongly implies that "tasks" = "running Android processes".

It seems that "tasks" is just one of those ambiguous terms we should steer people away from. I suppose that as long as there is a "task-manager", the tag auto-suggest will guide people to the right tag.

Maybe we "lock" [tag:tasks] so it cannot be used (there was a possibility as far as I remember), and instead provide "tasklist"? Or simply lock it away, as there are not so many questions using it either.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags can be "blacklisted" but that's just for extreme cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But I guess what we agree on is: questions tagged "tasks" *AND* "to-do" should get the "tasks" tag removed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm leaning that way, but I'd like to see if anyone has any strong reasoning for either direction.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My few reasons: 1) reduce ambiguosity (reason for my last comment), 2) make things easier to find (re-tag; those are only tagged "tasks" are harder to find) and 3) concentrate stuff to make way for the Generalist badge xD


















https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware could relate not just to the system firmware, but - as you already noted - also the radio/wifi/camera/etc. firmware. That prevents me from liking the idea. https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/624/how-should-we-handle-the-flash-tagIn the past, if we had an ambiguous tag we specialized the name(s). I would preferably blacklist https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware and introduce https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/system-firmwaresystem-firmware or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/device-firmwaredevice-firmware.

Firmware is not at all the same as ROM.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Many recommendations, but nothing happened :) Might I rise the question again: merge 'firmware' (x57) to 'radio-firmware' (x10) and synonymize? (Optionally clean-up/retag questions not related to radio-firmware first; if this path is agreed upon, I volunteer to take over that task)


















Another two synonymously used tags: All 4 questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hard-resethard-reset deal with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/factory-resetfactory-reset (x67). In fact, except for one they are even tagged factory-reset additionally.

I'd suggest to merge those four questions into factory-reset, and optionally make hard-reset a synonym to factory-reset. Though Matthew may be correct that a "hard reset" originally might have referred to "hard reboot" (by removing the battery) -- everywhere I read about hard-resetting a device, the procedure decribed was in fact a factory reset.

Merging would be as easy as removing 3 tags from their respective questions, and just change a single one I guess ;)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge hard-reset and factory-reset?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even if the usage is rare, I'm against merging. Matt's view on hard vs. factory reset (also mine): http://android.stackexchange.com/a/6423/15713b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Edited the hard-reset tag wiki (and shamelessly copied parts of Matt's answer, ahem) :-) Maybe that helps.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some discussion about it in the chat: http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/6100395#6100395b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Better to just remove "hard-reset" from those few questions and let it die.


















Nooooooo. They are not the same.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In that case, some of the [tag:hard-reset] Qs are mis-tagged. Take a look at [Can we get rid of viruses by simply factory resetting the device? ](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/26180/) -- clearly speaks about nothing else than factory-rest. Same for [How to hard/factory/whatever reset a 1.6 tablet whcih will not boot?](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/10931/). Makes half of them. The third is asking about "what's the difference between the two". So clearly to the ones who ask it seems to be the same ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then re-tag them. You have the power.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, will do. That leaves only two of them there. Not sure about the threshold that makes a "useful tag"...


















I merged these tags and made https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wifi-hotspotwifi-hotspot the master since:


It was the more popular of the two
It will be included a bit more visibly (as in, not just as a synonym) in the autocomplete this way
If we ever need to differentiate between different types of hotspots in the future (unlikely, but I suppose somewhat feasible) then we just need new tags of the form https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/x-hotspotx-hotspot.
I flipped a coin and that's what came up (kidding or am I?)

Deletion

Besides many other features the moderator tools focus heavily on deletion/undeletion management. One action you can take is to review the closed questions for possible deletion candidates. But make sure that you don't vote to delete a question that is http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/linking-duplicate-questions/closed as duplicate. Furthermore, use your common sense if a question should really be deleted: Does  it, although it is closed, may provide valuable information? Finally, don't waste your delete vote on questions with a negative score, that is not locked and has no answers. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/92006/156683It will get deleted after 30 days automatically by the system.

Use the magic of search queries to find possible deletion candidates:


https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=title:best%20closed:1Closed questions with "best" in title
(extend list here)


Reopen votes

Once in a while we change our policy about what is considered off-topic. https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/790/should-we-revisit-our-how-do-i-root-x-policyFor example how we handle questions about rooting. Which means that we have to reopen some questions that where considered off topic/not constructive/etc before. The mod tools provide an easy way to see were votes accumulate. https://android.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=close&daterange=last30daysUse that and cast your vote accordingly.

Checking flagged posts

This helps to keep our site clean. Though you might not be able to directly close/delete/migrate stuff, adding your flag moves the item up in the queue and helps moderators to quickly recognize the "important ones" (see also https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1187/dealing-with-obvious-spamDealing with obvious spam).

Anonymous and low rep post feedback

Is actually a pretty nifty feature. https://android.stackexchange.com/tools/post-feedback/overrated?filter=allOverrated posts which got a lot of negative feedback  could be a possible problem that needs to be fixed. On the other hand https://android.stackexchange.com/tools/post-feedback/underrated?filter=allunderrated posts may deserve a little upvote love from you.

Anything else?

Most other functionality is already covered in the new review system.

When https://android.stackexchange.com/badges/33/copy-editorclicking to see the users that have earned the "copy editor" badge, there's two issues with the layout:


The space between the first and second name is way larger than the space between the second and third name.
The bronze badges of the third name aren't visible, but are present at the source.




I see this behaviour for the list of users that https://android.stackexchange.com/badges/37/famous-questionearned other badges 1 as well, but here, there's no reason as to why the space can't be optimized, since clearly the large blank space between the first and second name could be equalized with the blank space between the second and third name, thus leading to the presentation of the third name bronze badges count.


1) Easily justified by the questions with huge names, where only a layout change would fix the issue...

Both tags https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ramram (x7) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/memorymemory (x69) deal with the same thing (or rather the questions tagged thus do). Strictly spoken, RAM is part of memory -- but in daily use, they are used synonymously. So I'd suggest we do the same, and merge the 7 questions "ram" into "memory", plus making "ram" a synonym to "memory".

If anything I'd merge the reverse direction for clarity.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Matthew is right, memory is often used for "internal storage", so the synonym target should be ram.


















We have three closely related tags on meta: /questions/tagged/useruser, /questions/tagged/usersusers, and /questions/tagged/user-accountsuser-accounts.

We're not talking about a lot of posts here, but from what I could all be handled with a single tag.

Please merge /questions/tagged/useruser and /questions/tagged/usersusers into /questions/tagged/user-accountsuser-accounts and leave synonyms behind.

I could go either way on that one if others have any thoughts regarding it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can see that. Cleaning up questions tagged with `user-accounts` may leave the tag empty, though, which is why I suggested it. For what it's worth, MSO has `user-accounts` separate from `users`, although the tag wiki of the latter seems to conflate it with the former. `user` is a synonym for `users`.


















As some of you may have noticed, I recently posted a community wiki question/answer https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/29677/can-i-use-my-device-on-a-different-carrierCan I use my device on a different carrier?

My intent in doing this was to try to pare down the number of questions we get which all fit into this formula. We've done this in the past with recurring questions, and I think that this is a very good candidate for a canonical question/answer. Although the questions may be specific to a phone and carrier, the answers are always inevitably the same:


Find the specs of the carrier (or available carriers, in the case of "Can I use X in country Y?")
Find the specs of the phone
Compare them to see if they run on the same networks and frequencies


In other words, I view this as a very ideal "teach a man to fish" situation, since we can readily point our users to sources which will provide the information they need rather than continuously looking up combinations of phones and carriers for them.

Ultimately, I would like to start closing questions as a duplicate of this one provided that it is well-received by the rest of the community. If you have any feedback or other thoughts - positive or negative - please use this question as a medium for your discussion.

So yesterday someone upvoted more than 10 of my Questions and Answers within about a minute of each other. I recognized what it was, serial upvoting, even though it had never happened to me before. As I expected (and is right) the whole thing was reversed a few hours later.

But now today it's happened again, with even more posts. I expect it'll be reversed again, and it should.

I have not received any gushing comments on a recent answer that would lead me to believe that someone found it so helpful that they want to upvote all of my other posts.

Is it possible that someone is trying to make it look like I'm sockpuppeting my way to higher reputation and, thus, get me suspended? I don't know what the point would be; I'm already over 10K and the privs one gets at 20K aren't that compelling. And I'm certainly not in it to be at the top of the Reputation leader board.

I'm baffled, frankly.

Since the text was copied verbatim from the source, I would have used the "quote" feature. Perhaps that's just me, though.

Answers in which the only useful information can be found at the end of a link aren't really answers. Links to the author's blog/site are particularly self-serving and "spammy". So, if there is good information, those answers should be edited to include that information. Otherwise they should be flagged as "not an answer" and/or "it is spam" and deleted.

Generally speaking, however, information from third-party sources should not be copied verbatim. If memory serves, there is even a Moderator tool to warn users and one of the options is to warn copiers. Yes, this is in order to honor copyright (where it applies) and fairness (where it doesn't).

In this particular case, the author of the post is self-identified as the owner of the blog being copied. How does one plagiarize oneself? Part of the purpose of copyright is to keep other people from taking credit for your work. In this case, the person who wrote the original is getting credit for writing it. Copyright is being respected.

If the author has a problem with his work being used in this way, as the original author of the post he can very quickly and easily edit it out or delete his question.

In this particular case I think the right thing was done. A not-useful answer was turned into a very useful one, and the original author of the information was given credit.

Now, when dealing with someone posting verbatim information from a third-party site that they didn't write, well, that's pretty clearly a no-no.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Having looked at this and seeing that I made the edit, I will note that this was basically my thought process in this instance. Since the author of the blog wrote the answer, I felt his work was still being attributed to him (although I usually do blockquote external snippets and such, I apparently forgot here). I also quite honestly forgot to check the blog footer for any kind of copyright notice since the author of the answer was the owner of the blog and posting the answer here implied to me a desire to share and allowed him to retain control (he could delete it, as you note). *Mea culpa*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5please take another look at the answer in question. Another user (the above commenter) edited  in his work-Seb did not edit in the verbatim copy, so did not `plagiarize oneself`. In a later comment Seb `thank's for editing it for me`, but perhaps he felt he could not argue since the two previous comments pretty much told him that you cannot post a link to your blog. My understanding for copyright is that you can reproduce `Text: 10 percent or 1000 words, whichever is less` so quoting the entire post with attribution is not acceptable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I get it. It would go against copyright if eldarathis posted his own answer and copied Seb's blog post and presented it as his own. In this case, he just added it to Seb's answer. So Seb's answer is a copy of of Seb's blog post. No one is suggesting that Seb's work is anyone's but Seb's. If that's not acceptable to you, well, I'm not a lawyer and, apparently, neither are you. This then would be an issue to take up with the Stack Exchange team.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even if you clearly state the original author you can't just post an entire piece of work-don't need to be a lawyer to know that. So I guess my question is, if an edit should have taken place by another user, how much should have been quoted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@row1 I think you might be right that the editor doesn't have the right to use the content in full, even in the original creator's post ... however, it's complicated, and I would also refer you to the SE team if you have concerns.  Note that the answerer did acknowledge the edit and left it as-is, however, which I would consider "permission granted" in this case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead yeah I didn't want to get hung up on this particular example too much.


















This question https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/30194/how-do-i-install-google-play-app-on-my-stock-android-deviceHow do I install Google Play on my stock android device was closed as an exact duplicate of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/27808/how-can-i-install-the-google-apps-package-play-store-on-my-android-devicehow-can-i-install-the-google-apps-package-play-store-on-my-android-device 

These are different questions.  My question is a stock device without custom rom.  The answer for the suggested question does not work and is not applicable.  None of the linked information in the answers to that post work.  This answer, which I am providing to my own now closed question, does answer the question, and does not involve any custom firmware or rooting or flashing.

Kind regards.

The answer should be something like:

"Add Google Apps to your android device by following the information given by Google here - http://support.google.com/a/users/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1738362Set up your Android for Google Apps

Pay special attention to their note about 2-step verification and https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=185833&topic=1056283&ctx=topicapplication specific passwords.  If you have 2 step verification turned on you need to generate a special one time password by visiting your Google accounts settings page, and then going to the Authorizing applications & sites page.

Setting up an account is very different from installing Google's proprietary apps, and if Google's apps were not installed it would actually not even be possible to add a Google account through your settings as those instructions state. Were Google's apps preinstalled on your device or no?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The Google Play App ("white shopping bag") was not pre-installed.  It is installed when the account is set up.  (The other apps (mail etc) are pre-installed.)  Setting up the account includes a non-intuitive step for people with two-step verification.  Entering your normal password and email address will fail.  You need to enter your email and the specially generated one time password.  Doing that will set up your phone to use Google Apps; part of that set up is getting access to the Google Play app.  (And getting access to Google Play through a web browser on the phone).


















I guess the subject already shows a lot of redundancy concerning "sharing". Keeping in mind different meanings:


sharing of files, texts, pictures, etc. via the share menu
sharing a geo-location using services like e.g. Latitude
sharing a connection (for which we already have the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tethertether and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reverse-tetherreverse-tether tags
sharing a screen
other means of sharing a device (which will probably have other tags like multi-user when needed, as soon as 4.2 comes out with that feature)


I'd suggest the following:


merging https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shareshare (x29) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sharingsharing (x13), optionally with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/share-menushare-menu (x1), making one the "master" and the other(s) synonym(s)
merging https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screen-sharescreen-share (x1) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screen-sharingscreen-sharing (x1), making one the master and the other a synonym to it

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What to do about 5 tags: share, sharing, share-menu, screen-share, screen-sharing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`share` is a complete mess.  I think we should have `share-menu` solely for questions specifically about the menu, plus `screen-sharing`, and eliminate the rest.  I don't care that you're uploading your photos because you want to "share" them, that's useless as a tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you, @MatthewRead. And I surely didn't mean to count "uploading things to share" within this range. I meant to distinguish between share-menu, screen-sharing, geolocation-sharing, and possibly overlooked other sharing methods we can care about when they come up. In other terms: I share your concern ;) But it still leaves open how to tag a question about sharing a geo-location (Latitude or otherwise), as this has nothing to do with the share-menu or screen-sharing. Do we need a location-sharing tag then?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd stick with just `geolocation` or whatever the relevant tags are, I'm not sure that `location-sharing` is a coherent problem class.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, let's postpone that until it becomes such :) So I'm with you and your first comment here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I think "shar(e|ing)" are not  useful tags. Fortunately there's not too many of them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Heh. Now that I've retagged a bunch of stuff with "share-menu" and otherwise cleaned up "share" and "sharing" I found a lot of dupes. Gotta go back and report 'em.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett Yeah, that's how I often find (and v-c) dupes. Guess why so many merge requests came from me recently :) So thanks for merging. Q: Did you mark the "emptied tags" to become synonyms? I see e.g. sharing is empty now. If so, how long does it take to get active, or does it need to be manually approved? Looks like the similar question which arose yesterday on the (emptied-on-merge) configuration tag (maybe you could check for that one whether it needs approval, so we know for the next time and don't get confused next time ;).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead See previous comment: Remember our problem with the "configuration" tag yesterday? Now you've probably got the chance to check with the "sharing" tag, if it got queued somewhere and needs approval. Unfortunately, I cannot (yet) do that myself, not enough rep ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not a Mod. I can only suggest or vote on synonyms, and only if I meet the criteria in the tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett Thanks anyway! As it worked out in the other case (configuration ./. settings), I'm confident it will do here as well (though e.g. "sharing" still seems empty and not yet synonymized).


















Agreed, done. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! But what about the synonym? Not useful? I just think of future tagging by new users. Description currently says: *settings currently has no approved synonyms*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I selected that option ... just tried again and it still didn't work.  Maybe it takes a bit to show up?  Not sure why they would cache synonyms....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It just says "no approved". Maybe it needs somebody to approve? I wonder, as your rep should be high enough. If you marked it for synonym, that's all I can ask for -- so I'll try to be patient and faithful it will work out. Otherwise I'll ask for a new merge in a couple of weeks xD Thanks again!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't quite confirm it for sure, but it actually appears that the merge + synonymize functionality might be broken. I merged two tags yesterday and marked for them to become synonyms, but it doesn't appear to have been applied. I had to go in and do it manually just now to make it show up as a synonym (/cc @Izzy just as an FYI)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Thanks for confirming our suspicion -- and of course for fixing it for the current cases! So let's hope the techs get it fixed soon :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Are the devs aware of it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I haven't reported it on Meta or anything, but I don't know that I have enough information myself to confirm it at the moment. Though if it did happen to you here (and you're fairly certain you checked the "synonymize these" box) then that might be enough to go on. I personally can say I certainly *thought* I had checked the box to create a synonym on the tags I merged yesterday, but I can't say with 100% certainty that I actually did.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Great thanks, I'll report it.


















Since https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screen-sharescreen-share and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screen-sharingscreen-sharing are so similar I didn't synonymize, just kept the latter.  If you start typing the former, the latter should pop up before you finish.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/shareshare and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sharingsharing should now be empty and should be automatically deleted in 24 hours or so.

One related case I found was https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/file-sharingfile-sharing.  I'm not sure if this is necessarily a good tag but it's better than the ones we removed, so I left it.  Other questions may need to be retagged to use it if we want to keep it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! I will keep my eyes open for those "others". I think `file-sharing` should be kept. Let me see to provide it a summary: This should be used e.g. for torrent stuff as well as on-device "file servers" (ftpd and the like) IMHO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I'd keep those separate since the methods involved are pretty distinct.  Probably `torrenting` would be sufficient for the first since I don't think ED2K or other P2P networks are popular with Android :P.  Possibly `file-shares` would be clearer than `file-sharing` for FTP/SMB/etc, what do you think?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess we could split this up later when needed. I just created the tag info -- feel free to update, as I completely forgot about Samba :)


















It seems that synonyms aren't being created when the These two tags are synonyms and mean the exact same thing is checked during a merge.  Both eldarerathis and I had a problem with this, see the comments https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1126/1465here for more info.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Synonymizing tags during merging does not workb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And if it's helpful, two merges in question were `repeating-reboot` into `boot-loop` and `configuration` into `settings`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I merged two tags just now and made double-sure that I checked the "synonymize" box. It did not work, so I think I can confidently say this functionality is not working at the moment.


















I just discovered we have https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mapmap (x13) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mapsmaps (x7) tags. Though it looks like the latter mainly deals with "map applications" (mostly Google Maps), while the former is used for "map material", I'd suggest to...


re-tag all "Google Maps" related questions to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-mapsgoogle-maps (another existing tag) if they are not referring to the map material but to the app only
merge maps with  map
optionally make the empty one a synonym to the other

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge "map" and "maps" tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Item #1 doesn't need a moderator. Go for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, done that. Still left are some double-tagged ones where I was not sure whether to remove the map/maps tag or not (i.e. the question addressed both, the app and the material). Those should solve on merge now.


















Since Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean are 25% of the active Android devices out there, but Gingerbread is still over 50% of the active devices, it occurs to me that instructions for changing settings may look very different to people with different devices. Sure, this was a problem before, but it's more pronounced now.

Anyway, my suggestion is that if you're including instructions to someone on how to change a setting in the OS or in an app, include the version of the OS (and app) you're using as a note in your answer. 

Yes, I can envision having two separate answers saying virtually the same thing, the only difference being the OS version being referenced, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It's probably better than having nearly-but-not-quite duplicate questions, different only by the OS version.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A suggestion on answers: Include OS version and app version (if applicable)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is a pretty fair point. Settings are quite different between versions of Android. Or even between different skins (Motoblur, Sense, etc.)


















Alternatively, perhaps we should revisit the "don't include OS-specific tags unless it truly is specific to the OS" rule. http://gaming.stackexchange.comArqade works that way, insisting that you include a platform-specific tag if you're discussing a game that exists on multiple platforms.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say if there's a question about Android System settings, that should be sufficient to include a version tag. For other things it's at least worth mentioning the Android version, as e.g. a certain misbehaviour *could* be version specific.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not quite sure if this is the same as what you're saying, but Arqade only includes the platform-specific tag if the platform is relevant.  Most questions apply across platforms.


















I agree that they don't need to be distinct.  I've merged them into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/networkingnetworking.  A synonym wouldn't work since "network access" is a subset of "networking".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ack. Hence the "optionally" in my request :) Thank you!


















I suggest the following procedure:


Search with a suitable query for closed how to root questions. https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=how%20root%20closed:1Example.
Nominate the question for reopening
If the question is reopend, https://android.stackexchange.com/q/1184/1465add it to the canonical question's cw answer and make sure that the question is tagged with the correct device tag.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Straightforward.  We'd just need to double-check for duplicates I suppose.  I'm also wondering if this is something mods should just do immediately, at least for the decently formulated questions.


















We have tags for individual device manufacturers. This makes sense because there is the occasional question that covers multiple/all devices from the same manufacturer. 

However, they are often abused and misapplied.


There's not a tag for the asker's specific device
The asker didn't see that there is a device-specific tag
At least one tag is required, so the asker had to add something
etc.


You can help by looking through the questions with these manufacturer tags and


replacing it with a model-specific tag where it makes sense


remember: most Android issues are not model-specific; unless it's clear that it's an issue with a specific model don't use the tag

removing the tag if the question is not about the manufacturer in general
confirming that it really belongs

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Manufacturer tag cleanupb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say this is a task to repeat in intervals, and we should probably include other manufacturers as well. I just went over "htc to huawei" now, ad did a big roundhouse-kick (re-tagging to the real device, or removing the manufacturer tag completely if unrelated to the issue). Feel free to add more manufacturers for the next run :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy: I agree. What manufacturers should be added?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Guess you already covered the major ones. For completeness, there's e.g. Sony (has no tag, oops). And, even though not (directly) a device manufacturer, "google" has a similar issue (being used as fallback for everything), so I would include that tag as well. // Let me add some more manufacturers meanwhile; if you disagree with "google", simply remove it afterwards :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, Google's going to be a special case. It's a manufacturer (sort of), an app developer, and the owner of Android. Virtually every question tagged with `google` should be retagged with something more specific. Perhaps that's a separate tag cleanup project.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Feel free to edit/move. I feel it a good idea to have everything in one place, as the task is re-occuring regularly (say, we should check every 3 months or the like).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy: I moved the carriers to their own cleanup question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point you linked there. So we can keep this as "master ticket" :) Maybe we should do the same for the "currently unused" watchlist?


















Done. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, but you appear to have missed the [tag:xperia-play] synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett: Oops, you're right. I synonymized `sony-xperia-play` but not `xperia-play`. Both should be synonyms now.


















The system prevents new users from doing some actions until they have enough repution. One of these restrictions is the ability to comment on any other answers (needs 50+ reputation).

I frequently see comments posted as answers due to missing privileges. Seemingly new users want to contribute enough that they're willing to take the hurdle of creating an account in the first place and then notice they will need reputation points to proceed. That is however too much a hurdle and thus often an answer is posted instead of a comment.

To boot, those users' first impression is criticism from us for violating the rules. From the new user's perspective this may lead to frustration and some may immediately turn their back on this site.

It's discourage malign usage versus lower the entrance barrier for benign users. Our site is rather low volume and I have the strong impression that our user base is split in two halves: Questioners and answerers (who share their expertise). Often really good people are rather impatient with such things.

Would it be worth thinking about relaxing the comment everywhere privilege?
Or would this just drive up spam and moderator's work?

EDIT. Maybe this would be interesting to know:
What percentage and number of accounts has the ability to comment everywhere?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lower comment restrictions for new users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See [arvind's](http://android.stackexchange.com/users/23404/arvind) [answer](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/25359/how-to-make-an-android-device-to-display-complex-rendering-of-indic-characters) for exmple. Should be a comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't understand this either, it seems backwards that someone can post commentary or other crap prominently first, and in a less obtrusive manner later.  That said I'm sure this has been discussed to death on MSO....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: Indeed, there's a pretty long discussion on MSO: [Lower the amount of reputation needed to comment](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/12119) One of the main arguments for keeping the rep threshold in place is that it is much easier to police answers than comments (so an influx of bad/spam comments would be harder to find than an influx of bad/spam answers).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't have a look at MSO beforehand I must admit. IMHO, SO has however a much higher percentage of malign tendencies (hidden product placement, spam, SEO for own site, bad up/downvoting, sockpuppet accounts, etc.). Not so here. Plus: We have a split userbase into experts/answerers & askers. Lowering this would benefit new answerers as a questioner has already the ability to comment on all entries in his/her question. Besides this: I don't want to spin off a new lengthy discussion, I'll personally accept a short "no" too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This _has_ been discussed to death on [metase]. Since this would be something that would be changed network wide, that's the correct place for the discussion. But, before you bring it up again, note that someone asks this very question at least once a month and the answer remains the same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Some other example: I didn't notice this [answer](http://android.stackexchange.com/a/29705/15713) at all, should have been a comment on my answer. I have just now included this problem into mine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree - it can be quite difficult to get up to 50 rep to begin with, and people that are new to SE sites just don't understand the system. When I first signed up, I admit, I though it was ridiculous. I am just wondering whether it is hight because of other SE sites? If so, each site should really be able to have independent privilege settings.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also new users get lot of down votes because of posting a comment as an answer. That's really not encouraging for a new user. You are new into the system and you immediately start getting down votes!

On StackOverflow I had seen a question with six "answers" and none of which was a real answer. And when I commented asking the users to post comments they said they don't have enough rep to do that, and went on posting more comments as answers!


















Last year, https://gaming.stackexchange.com/Arqade had a little promotion around the holidays called the http://blog.gaming.stackexchange.com/2011/12/holiday-2011-hat-dash-the-hattening/Hat Dash, wherein meeting certain activity thresholds would earn hats that a user's avatar could then "wear" throughout the site:



This year, Stack Exchange has decided to open up the Hat Dash to any site that decides to opt-in. The specifics:


  This event will run from 19 December 2012 to 4 January 2013. Users
  will be able to see their entire hat collection on http://winterba.shhttp://winterba.sh.
  That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and
  other details of the event. 
  
  Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see
  hats, and/or are generally  anti-hat will have an "I hate hats" option
  available, just as we had on Gaming last year. 
  
  The only visual change to the site itself will be the presence of the
  hats and the "I hate hats" button in the footer.


We need to respond by November 28th if the site would like to participate. Any site that does not respond by that date is considered to be opted-out.

So, what say you, people of A.SE? Should we participate in the Hat Dash this year, or would we prefer to opt-out of it entirely?



We have opted in to this promotion, so prepare for the arrival of hats this December!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we want to participate in this year's Hat Dash?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm fine with it.... they need an Android hat :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hats are the most awesome!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. I'm up for almost anything that will promote the site and encourage greater participation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes please!  HatDash was awesome.

I always wondered why there is no underline ability?

Not even using HTML tags

Is this by design for all SE sites, or just a handful (or just AE?)

Please could we have an underline feature added?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The ability to underline?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Underlining is usually only used as fall back when there is no way make text bold or italic. It is usually recognized as bad practise from a typesetting point of view.


















The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this.

I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.)

In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Town Hall Chat session with the candidates. This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary. I will be working with candidates to determine a time for the event.

The Town Hall Chat took place Wednesday the 5th at 18:00:00Z UTC / 1:00 PM EST. A digest can be found https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1189/2012-moderator-election-town-hall-chat-digesthere.

Here are the details so far:


I would like to schedule this towards the beginning of the primary phase.  This means that I am looking at the 3rd-5th of December. As soon as I coordinate with the existing moderators and candidates to find a best fit based on availability, I will edit this post with details on the "when".
The Town Hall Chat will be a one-hour event using our http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&sort=active&host=android.stackexchange.comchat platform.  I will update this post with a direct link to the chat room once the event is scheduled.
The format will be an open discussion.  Users are encouraged to pose questions to the candidates regarding their thoughts on moderation.
Priority for scheduling is generally towards the greatest number of candidate openings as well as the earliest. Candidates who cannot show up during the live event will still be able to answer all questions posted, they will just do so at their earliest convenience.
After the chat session, a digest of the event will be permanently linked here.

It's actually sitting at +1 / -2, which gives you 1*10 + 2*-2 = 6 rep.

For example if the question is regarding something on the Sony Ericson Xperia phone, should the tag be added to the question? One may answer "only if it's relevant" but it's not always apparent if it's relevant or not (e.g. an app not working).

  I have had 2 flags denied now, and I always wondered - is this a bad thing?


Two flags is nothing.  As a percentage, you're also doing well.


  Should I be disheartened if my flag gets denied?


Nope.  Just learn from it!  Or if you're convinced, try to explain your case (perhaps using the "Other" flag reason).


  Should I worry about wasting the time of a moderator, because it shouldn't have been flagged?


No.  If you see something going wrong we absolutely want you to flag it, a few misses here and there are perfectly fine (especially if you're improving your flagging as you go).

An exception is when people flag posts they just don't like, or instead of editing.  That's really annoying and not how flags should be used.


  I only flag posts for closure because I can't vote to close a post - should I not?


Until you can VTC, flagging is the right way to do it.


  What deem's a 'helpful' flag?


Most often, one that results in some kind of action.  If your flag is for the wrong reason but I think another reason still applies, I'll mark it helpful.  If an answer is nigh-unintelligible and you flagged as Not an Answer, but I happen to know what they're talking about and I edit instead, I'll mark the flag helpful.

I won't mark the flag helpful in cases where someone flags NAA but it's just a spelling and grammar error-ridden post where the meaning is still clear.  That's the decline reason that says "Flags should only be used where moderator intervention is required"; we aren't here to do editing on your behalf :)

I will also occasionally mark flags helpful in cases where I do absolutely nothing except think hard about it.  When an issue is borderline and I just barely am on the "nothing needs to be done" side, I won't fault you for flagging it.

We've got a lot of tags which, in my opinion, do not make much sense. To give some examples:


app-specific tags for "minor apps", e.g. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tunein-radiotunein-radio (x1), https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/repligorepligo (x1). I fully go with tags for "major apps" which are widely used (good examples here include https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-mapsgoogle-maps (x80) or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-storegoogle-play-store (x538). But the playstore holds over half a million apps -- we cannot provide a tag for each of them.
question-specific tags applying to only one (or very few) very specific questions, as e.g. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/zipalignedzipaligned (x1)


In my opinion, those tags are not very helpful -- but rather make tag-maintenance more difficult. So we might better...


discourage users from creating such (sure, rep already does so -- but our better-rep'd members should be aware of this and not simply jump-in when a questioner mentions "...I unfortunately lack the rep to create this tag..."
check whether we should "orphan" some of those tags, so the auto-purge cleans them up.


EDIT: MSO mentions some https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48417/should-we-zap-the-low-occurrence-tags/48418#48418auto-cleaning task running monthly and cleaning up single-used tags from questions aged 6+ months, so this does part of the job. So let me refine my question to: What should we do when we just stumble-upon such an occurence where the question is, say, only 3+ months old, but the fact as such is clear?

Note also this quote from the linked MSO question:


  Any tags not currently in use, or that happen to get orphaned through unusual means (rollback, merge, etc), are removed every 24 hours by a background process.


Another still remaining question is whether those two tasks apply to all stacks, as the answer just mentions 4 of them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to deal with "minor tags"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tags with only one question should be cleaned up automatically [after 6 months](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/48418/154510). I agree that users with tag creation privileges should think hard when creating one, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: I.e., you're for the 2nd option of orphaning low-usage tags? I'm for this option (if the tag is not in much use, then it's a low risk to just orphan it and hope noone uses it in the meantime)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ce4 There's nothing wrong with low-usage tags in general (although low usage may hint at some other problem with a tag).  We should removed useless tags and keep/add useful ones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say if a tag stands with only one attached Q for 6 months or longer, this fact speaks for itself. Wouldn't you agree?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No.  It could just as easily mean that the tag should be more widely applied but hasn't been -- failure to use tags appropriately goes both ways.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh -- good one, tnx. Guess you don't mind I take that hint up to the question (to make it easier to spot). Remains the Q whether we should take sone action if stumbling upon such a tag on a just, say, 4 month old Q -- or rather wait for the auto-cleaner to come around?


















I don't think we should jump the gun on the tag cleanup process.

While I can't find any examples at the moment, on multiple occasions I've run across a question where it is the only question for a tag and was able to find a minimum of two or three other questions that could be so tagged.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While that might apply to many a tag, shouldn't we still at least discourage from creating "a tag for each app"? I'd say it would even make sense to have a popup (or the like) appearing when creating a new tag, with a kind of Windows "are you sure" plus the appropriate hint. Hm, not that anyone would read it, I guess...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I made the same experience as Al and see no problem with minor tags either. If the cleanup scripts deals with them fine, if not then there is a reason for them to exist. I also see no problem with app specific tags, IMHO that's better then a whole 'applications' tag.


















You can vote for this one person as your first choice, and it will be counted towards it.

Your other two votes will be wasted however.

If you have already used all three votes you can withdraw two if you vote for your favourite for 3rd, 2nd and then first. This deletes 3rd and 2nd votes from other candidates.


















Use meaningful, specific subject titles

Bad Example: URGENT HELP NEEDED - Galaxy S Problem!

Good Example:  Samsung Galaxy S keeps restarting itself randomly. How can I stop this?


Include the important information in the title
One should be able to read the whole context of the question just by reading the title1


Be precise and informative about your problem


Describe symptoms carefully
Add information about the hardware and software you're using
Be explicit about your question


Try to write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language

Every non-native speaker is welcomed to ask questions (and provide answers) on Android Enthusiasts, but we expect a minimum of readability. Errors are human, nevertheless please try your best to write in grammatical, correctly-spelled English.

Mention any troubleshooting steps already taken

What have you already tried to solve the issue?  Providing those can help avoid answers/comments with suggestions that you have already tried unsuccessfully.

Do not use CAPS

Don't try to emphasize a word by writing it in Caps (e.g. "IMPORTANT"), use bold tags ("important") or italics ("important") instead.

Avoid the https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378/156683XY problem at all costs

Don't ask about your attempted solution, instead ask about your actual problem. That is: if you are trying to solve problem X, make sure to ask about X and not about potential solution Y.

Only ask one question in your post

The daily question limit is high, so please use separate questions for separate issues.  Asking about more than one question in your post will only cause confusion.

Provide screenshots if possible

A picture is worth a thousand words, but try to keep pictures in https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/108821/286110a reasonable size; huge pictures make it hard to catch the whole idea.

Use paragraphs when appropriate

It's hard to read a wall of text (https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/34405/1example). Make use of Enter once in a while.

Footnotes

1 Although not strictly required, it's often a good idea to phrase the title as complete sentence.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with `The title should be a complete sentence`.   "Samsung Galaxy S keeps resetting itself randomly" gives complete information, the fact that a fix is desired is obvious.  "How can I stop this?" won't help searches.  The decision to make it a full sentence is purely one of style.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also disagree with `It is not relevant what you think that is causing your problem`.  Informed opinions can be highly useful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But it won't affect searches either. Plus I think that when one forms whole sentences, he/she reflects again about the essential problem. Which is very helpful. Also I intentionally wrote "should" and not "have to be".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I struggle with that one also. It made sense when I read it, but I think the phrasing could be improved. Or simply remove it completely. Let's see what others have to say.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could also be worth merging in a couple of relevant points from http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/156810/stack-overflow-question-checklist I'm thinking of the first two points in particularb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would also add a section about troubleshooting steps already taken.  No sense having answers suggesting for example a reboot or data wipe, if the OP has already tried those unsuccessfully.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How about "use tags to describe your question, not your device"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure. IMHO precise and correct tagging is not directly related to the questions quality. It's just a nice feature to group relevant questions together and to improve searching. So in order to keep the answer as short as possible, I intentionally decided against any information about tags. But if the majority wants this information, why not. But I think we need to specify some tag policy first.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead I defused the "complete sentence" part. Hope you like it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow: No, I see where you're coming from. I'll see if I can put together a "How do I tag my Question effectively?" Q&A.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looks good.​​​​b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps the first item here should be "check to see if someone has already asked the question".


















I have seen some questions where images are shown as text labels. The text label is not actually text but an image with only the text label. However, the actual image is not shown. For example, see this screensot of https://android.stackexchange.com/q/34816/22822a question:

I can say that the problem is specific to this network only, works otherwise...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's in fact strange. Still, v-c for "too localized" :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No need to close, I don't think. This is a real issue that will be experienced by anyone who is not able to connect to stack.imgur.com. Incidently, @Flow, you should add that as an answer so Suraj can accept it.


















It seems like you are unable to reach http://stack.imgur.com/ where most images on the SX network are hosted. The images work for me. Maybe your network admistrator has blocked imgur.com for some reason.

When I blocked stack.imgur.com, I was unable to see any picture. But, I also did *not* see the text labels. So maybe there is more to the problem than just the site being blocked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe, at least we agree that it's a local issue. :)


















Is there any way to change/ withdraw a suggested edit I made, while it's in the review process?

I started to edit a https://android.stackexchange.com/a/34906/668post, but in the same time another user with edit privileges changed it even better, not only correcting the spelling, but also adding some more informations. So when I finally submitted my edit, it appeared like I have take down some of the good infos added.

As the edit was done in the review process, before clicking I'm done, I saw that the post was already modified, but I could't find any way to revert/reject it.

My question is if there exists some option to solve myself this kind of problem or I should just wait for my post to be rejected by the community.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Change my own suggested editb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 from me for this question -- and additionally asking what can be done from the other side: After I saved my edit (yeoo, guilty ;) I saw Adinia's edit in the review queue. I wanted to give her credit for it without losing/overwriting mine (as it took considerable time to make it, for both edits), but saw no way to do it. If this side of the medal could be considered in the answer, I'd really appreciate it!


















I saw a post that is obvious spam. How should I deal with it? What is the proper action to take?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Dealing with obvious spamb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is just something of a PSA since we've seen a bit of an uptick in spam somewhat recently and (luckily) haven't had to deal with it very much in the past.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should be done with the OP's account (like if he advertises his pirateapps site in his profile)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ce4: *In general*, people can put whatever they want in their profiles as long as it is not offensive or extremely distasteful. However, if you see something that just doesn't seem right (like obviously illegal content) then feel free to flag a post with "Other" and explain your concern. If the user has no posts then a good option is to flag one of **your** posts with "Other", provide a link to the profile, and explain your thoughts that way. At the very least, we will take a look at it and discuss it with the SE folks if we need to.


















Unfortunately, spam slips onto just about every site on the Internet, and Android.SE is not an exception. This post is intended to provide a brief guide on dealing with obvious spam and advertising on the site.

The Stack Exchange system has specific measures in place to help deal with spam. One of the most important of these is the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/how-does-the-spam-flag-workspam flag. If you find a post that you think is obvious spam, click the "flag" link and select the "It is spam" option:



The spam flag has a few special properties in comparison to other flags:


A spam flag will also cast an automatic downvote without inflicting a rep penalty on the flagger
Posts that receive 3 spam flags will be banished from the front page
Posts that receive 6 spam flags will be automatically deleted and locked by https://android.stackexchange.com/users/-1/communityCommunity♦
If a post is deleted by spam flags it will deduct 100 rep from the author


By flagging spam when you see it, the community can not only help moderators identify spam posts, but can also deal with the posts without any mod intervention. This means that the size of the community itself becomes a very effective tool in dealing with spammers.

In addition, try to remember these guidelines when you come across a spam post:


Don't worry about editing it. Spam posts will be deleted and locked anyway, and links on Stack Exchange sites use the http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.htmlrel=nofollow attribute, meaning that the links won't improve the site's search rating. Further, https://meta.superuser.com/questions/3574/should-we-replace-the-content-of-spam-posts-so-that-they-say-they-are-spam#comment8649_3576moderators and SE employees can search through deleted posts. If you leave the link in then it can be easier to determine how often something has been spammed on the site.
If the post is a question, don't worry about voting to close. The spam flag will obliterate (delete + lock) the post anyway, so it won't matter if it was closed first.
In general, don't worry about leaving a comment. Spammers know they're spamming, and they know that it's against the rules. They don't care, and leaving a comment is highly unlikely to have any meaningful effect (plus, odds are you'd just be talking to a robot).
Don't worry about downvoting. You have a limited number of votes each day - use them on content that deserves those votes instead of on spam. As noted above, the flag will impose a -1 vote on the post anyway.

Ok.

The moderator election closes in ~3 hours, and I was just wondering how long after it was closed will we know who the winners were?

Will the winners have to accept the moderator agreement before the results can be displayed? Is this all done automatically, or does it require human intervention?

P.S

I was wondering whether to ask this here or MSO - which one should it have been?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When will we know who won the election?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Asking here is fine.


















When you see a post here on meta titled "2012 Community Moderator Election Results" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends. 

Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends.

But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you.

It's very well hidden for some reason. The options that are shown after you hit Flag or disagree button also have on option that is named "Invalid flag".

I direct your attention to the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/foldersfolders tag.

It's being used for questions on:


folders on the SD card/in the filesystem (you know, what we used to call "directories" until Microsoft brainwashed us)
folders on the home screen that can hold multiple app icons
email folders
file folders become albums in the Gallery app if there are image files within (and they're picked up by the media scanner)


That's a mess.

I think the fourth issue there can be ignored; I'll be removing that tag from the offending question in just a minute.

The third issue is also probably just something that needs cleanup. I mean, do we really need to have a tag for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/email-foldersemail-folders that wouldn't just be covered by https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/emailemail?

The first two issues, though, definitely require disambiguation. I would suggest https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homescreen-foldershomescreen-folders for the second and either https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/system-folderssystem-folders or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/file-foldersfile-folders for the first. I also think that, because it's unique to Android, that the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/foldersfolders tag should become a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homescreen-foldershomescreen-folders (after we clean up the existing questions, of course).

I'm not sold on the names; I'd be more than happy to hear alternatives. I do think https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/foldersfolders needs to be cleaned up, though.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Need to disambiguate "folders"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Completely agree with that. Names sound good to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, but think that it should be system-folders and not file-folders.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ZnewmaN: I'm not married to either one. That's what tag synonyms are good for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`folders` should be unused now, but I didn't synonymize it with anything yet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, as I said, I don't have particularly strong feelings about it, except that the existing tag wiki makes it related to file folders (or system folders if you prefer) and I am sure that the tag will come back in the not-too-distant future.


















The https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/input-methodinput-method tag seems to be used for a confusing mish-mash of topics.

Everything from https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/29691/how-to-have-multiple-input-languagesinternational keyboard types and IMEs, to how to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1872/how-to-use-the-search-box-on-these-stack-exchange-sites-with-the-galaxy-smake a Submit button appear on web page form or how to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/19188/android-audio-inputattach a guitar to your phone's audio socket or how to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/27354/can-i-use-a-joystick-with-the-happy-bay-emulatoruse a joystick, these are all on the first page for the tag.

It seems to me that there's no real commonality between all those questions.

From just hearing the tag name I'd assume it was meant to refer to IMEs (Input Method Editors, usually a way to input complex characters for languages like Chinese on a keyboard with a limited number of buttons, also used to switch between different keyboard types). But I can see that most of the other questions also involve a form of input to the device.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's the Input-Method tag for?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Personally, I would say that it's about the "Choose Input Method" notification you get when you have multiple keyboards installed and you open a text input field. Then, by extension, it's also about choosing the keyboard and related issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah I can see that now, didn't occur to me at first, but that's another one


















I think we need to disambiguate the tag, firstly decide what it means, and then rename it to be less ambiguous and put a matching tag wiki on there (currently there's no tag wiki for it which will partially explain the confusion in its use).

My proposal would be to rename the tag to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/input-method-editorinput-method-editor and then re-tag all the questions that don't fit anymore, possibly creating something like a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hardware-inputshardware-inputs tag for some of them, and adding the (already existing) https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-inputtext-input tag to others like the form entry ones?

Sample tag wiki for the IME tag could be something like:


  An input method editor is a OS or keyboard component or program that
  allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their
  keyboard. For instance this allows the user of a Latin keyboard to
  input Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Indic characters.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`input-method-editor` would get at least me more confused. Though it might be the correct term, only few will get the association. And I guess only few really read the wiki excerpt, even less the wiki itself before using a tag. In your example, what would you do to the existing tag? Make it a synonym -- and if, to what? Another point to consider: IME is not restricted to "text". There are also barcode readers around you can use as IME (e.g. [ImageCode IME](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.cbs.mobile.android.ImageCodeIMS)).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So perhaps the answer would be to leave Input-Method in place and use it for anything related to (soft) keyboards, keyboard layouts, changing keyboards. And then (after formulating a wider keyboard related wikik than my one above) move out and retag everything that isn't related to that (the web forms, guitars, etc)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd count hardware-keyboards and other mentioned IMEs (Barcode readers and the like) valid -- as long as they serve to "replace" the standard IME (so in this context I adjust my above statement: resulting input should be *text*, as in the end that's what those barcode IMEs produce as well). Maybe really use `input-method-editor` as the tag, and make `input-method` its synonym, both refering to "IME" (this way at least some people might think twice before [wrongly] using the tag). Agreed however on re-tagging everything else...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...though `hardware-input` then could also refer to barcode readers or external keyboards, which would count as IME. Not that big problem, I think -- though we might consider tags like `audio-input` for your guitar, line-in, external micro, and the like *instead*. The "submit button" example I'd clearly count as "mis-tagged", it fits in none of the mentioned tag suggestions.


















Summing up from GAThrawn's answer and its comments, might I suggest:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/input-method-editorinput-method-editor as main-tag, with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/input-methodinput-method as synonym. Wiki-Abstract: About entering text using a keyboard or other devices registering as "Input Method", the Wiki text itself could list up some more examples (as e.g. barcode-readers like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.cbs.mobile.android.ImageCodeIMSImageCode IME; I volunteer to create this, just send me a @ note when I shall start)
new https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/audio-inputaudio-input for things like line-in, guitar, and the like. Making sure by the Excerpt people don't mistake it with Siri :D
things like the mentioned web-button are clear candidates of mis-tagging to me (close-misses)
leaves the joystick and its companions (I could imagine bluetooth-/usb-mice and the like in this special category as well). Not sure about an appropriate tag here -- as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hardware-inputhardware-input could also be applied to usb-keyboards and mentioned barcode readers. We still could use this tag until we come up with something better (and rename/split it again), the few mentioned exceptions won't hurt.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion, `input-device` would be a better term than `hardware-input`b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 -- that sounds much better to me as well :)


















Should we merge the tags https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower (× 62), https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-managementpower-management (×14 20 (merged with 'battery-manager'))? I'd suggest keeping the first tag, and making the second a synonym to it.

Many questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower are dealing with power-management. However, there are also many dealing with powering on/off the device, which would speak for keeping them separated. In this case, we should at least re-tag the relevant questions. Note that the excerpt of the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower tag currently reads:


  For questions about power-management, power on/off, and the like.


Just noticed, the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-managementpower-management tag wiki excerpt reads:


  All about how to get the most out of your device's ressources, especially managing power consumption


Which would be quite similar to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/battery-lifebattery-life (oops)...
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag merge: power, power-managementb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As [agreed on in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/8801617#8801617), I will ASAP check all questions tagged 'power' which are rather refer to 'power-management' and re-tag them accordingly. Then we can decide what to do with the left-overs :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, that's done as well. So now what? 'power' -> 42, 'power-management' -> 30. Simply adjust the tag wikis? Still merge (and adjust tag wikis)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would it make sense to rename `power` to `power-on` and merge `power-management` into `battery-life` as a synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5According to their tag-wikis, that even looks like the perfect way. Half of the questions tagged `power-management` even tagged `battery-life` at the same time. I see no Q which could not go that way (2 might not be perfect matches, but well). So: Absolutely yes for that merge from me! As for `power`, that looks mixed (power adapter specs, power off, etc.). Maybe power-on + synonym power-off? But what about power-adapter-specs? Re-tag => charging? // I at least go and remove the "power management" from the 'power' tag wiki meanwhile :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, re-tagged a couple of power-Qs to 'charging'. Still a few irregularities, but marginal. I'd say: Yes to both now -- power => power-on/power-off, power-management can be merged to 'battery-life' (alsore-tagged some exceptions). And then 'status-completed' here -- wonderful, thankx @MatthewRead :)


















Obviously both are the very same thing. I'd suggest to merge them and converting the remaining one (depending on which is the merging target) into a synonym.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge wifi-hotspot and wifi-tethering?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This came up a while back (in 2010, it looks like): [wifi tags - are wifi-tethering and wifi-hotspot redundant?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/132) It might be worth revisiting, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. And as to Matt's answer there: one could still use two tags (e.g. wifi-hotspot and tether) if really necessary. Though I'd say most people don't distinguish the two. Is there really a technical difference between the two terms wifi-tethering and wifi-hotspot? I'm not aware of any (except you'd count an ad-hoc connection not as a hotspot, which might be an argument -- but still could be pointed to by using two tags then: wifi-hotspot and ad-hoc-networks)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess tethering over an ad-hoc connection may, from a technical standpoint, be different than a hotspot, as it wouldn't really be an AP in that situation. It would be essentially behaving like one, but I suppose it wouldn't *really* be one. I'm not sure if that alone is a convincing enough reason to leave them separated or not, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Exactly my point: only hair-splitting makes a difference here. And those who insist on *that* difference are rather discussing it at other SO "branches" (oh, there isn't a Networking SO? I thought there was...). So 1:0 pro merging the two :)


















I direct your attention to this question: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/10728/how-to-import-contacts-from-symbian-mobile-to-android-mobileHow to import contacts from symbian mobile to android mobile?

It has, as of this moment, five deleted answers. All are of the "me too" or "thanks that worked!" variety.

And yet, the question isn't "Protected".

It was my understanding that if https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/52765/21960a question gets three deleted answers from low-rep users attached to it, it automatically gets "Protected" status to help prevent these sorts of non-answer answers.

Did the automatic status change not happen? Or was it removed for some reason?

I think I've figured it out, but I'd like some confirmation from Team Stack Overflow if possible.

Of the five deleted answers:


one is from a fairly high-reputation user
one is from a user who got the association bonus and so has 101 reputation points
one is from a destroyed user account
leaving two from low-reputation (10 or less) users


So that would seem to indicate that this is /questions/tagged/status-bydesignstatus-bydesign.

I believe that these are actually different things:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wifi-hotspotwifi-hotspotcould represent any wifi network, or a public 'wifi hotspot'.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wifi-tetheringwifi-tethering would mainly represent the actual process of tethering, or creating a hotspot.

As such, I don't think they should be merged.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As said: when concerned about the *process*, one could use `wifi-hotspot` and `tether` to indicate this. Too many "similar" tags are IMHO not that helpful -- it gets harder to utilize them for searching, as you first need to figure out which are available. But OK, that's *my* opinion...


















In AE, the most important information one can find in the majority of questions is:


Phone manufacturer-model
Android version
Rooted/not rooted
Custom ROM installed (if any)


Thus, being those tags as important as they are, don't you think it's a good idea to provide a special way to identify them?

I've been thinking about this and a couple of ideas come to my mind:


A color scheme, just like the one being used here at Meta

Icons to identify each one the four tag categories mentioned above, like the icons for some tags at StackOverflow (android, facebook, google-maps, etc.)



I think this would help the users to quickly identify the essential tags they should include when asking a question, thus decreasing the amount of comments like "what brand and model of phone do you have?", "are you rooted?", etc; therefore boosting the average quality of the questions in AE. 

Is this feature something feasible?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to identify essential tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with Al regarding how we should do tagging.  Regarding having different type of tags, I do like the idea to a degree -- but this is also something SE has repeatedly said will not be done.


















Everyday I see too many development questions coming up on AE. Users are responsible for this but they are not to be blamed entirely for to any new user AE seems to be a site related to "Everything Android." So people keep asking development questions unaware of the fact that AE is only from a user's perspective and not of a developer.

Sure, we can flag / close / delete such questions. But wouldn't it be great if we could keep users from posting such questions in the first place?

Can we make users to go through a help page or add some guidelines on the "Ask a question" page, where we can highlight the point clearly telling them not to ask development questions here and ask them to check on https://stackoverflow.com/StackOverflow.

This will save other users' time flagging them and moderators' time in reviewing them. Also it will help keep site cleaner. After all "Prevention is better that cure," isn't it?

I am not sure how valid is my suggestion and if it can actually be implemented. So that's also a part of my question here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to stop users from posting development questions on Android Enthusiasts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even adding red boxes with bold text would not stop this -- most people don't even take the time to read them (that's not a raw guess, but from my experience on sites where they had such boxes). Sure we could even add a captcha there (just kidding). Some AI would be nice, analyzing the question title+text and popping up an "Isn't this a dev related Q? Shall we better post it on SO?" -- but I'm not sure whether this is currently doable without too much effort (something like the "Related" Qs I guess).


















background

I've had my question (http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/31918/how-can-i-sort-filter-and-tag-files-images-in-android-ics-4-0) closed until I rephrased it from "which app should i use to do X" to "how can I do X".

As I pointed out in the comments there, the question itself didnt change one bit - just the choice of words. Still, one of the versions is valid, the other is not. Why not?

As can be seen in the edit history, the first version of my question was not a popularity poll. I did not ask for the best app to do something, I asked for any app that could do it.

Now, in my opinion, either a question is valid, or its not, but it should not have anything to do with the wording. If the question was potentially helpful for others, answerable and not subjective, why close it? Is "you can hammer a nail with a hammer" subjective?

argumentation

I could have argued that my question was good, but i couldnt have argued about it being not-in-line with the FAQ (as it currently stands), so I edited it. But I would like to hold my point - that question was OK in its first version too!

What I want to say is, "how to do X" and "with what should I do X" are basically the same. So maybe we shouldnt close the second type just because of the wording? Both questions WILL attract exactly the same answers! Maybe the proper action would be just to edit the qeustion for the more desirable wording, instead of flagging and closing?

Actually, the "whats the best tool/app to do X" is also valid. Those questions are answerable, and those answers are as subjective as any other! What do I mean? When I ask "whats the best tool to hammer nails" the obvious answer is "a hammer". Its not subjective, right? Still, there will be people, who arent really experienced with hammers, and they have been using big rocks to hammer nails, and they will recommend rocks. Its doable, but not optimal. Such answers would be downvoted, the "hammer" answer would be upvoted. We end up in the same situation, in which we would end up with a "how do I hammer nails?". Those questions are the same!

I know that in some more complex cases, there will be many equally valid answers to the same "whats the best" question. Example? "Whats the best app to draw on a PC with a graphics tablet?" Some would say its Photoshop, others would say GIMP, someone will say its Inkscape. But that usually means that the question is just not specific enough. If the costs are a big issue, then GIMP will be superior to photoshop, and that will not be subjective. If youre interested in doing mostly vector graphics (which is not specified in the original question) then Inkscape will be better than GIMP.

summary

In my opinion, the ban for "whats the best app/what app should I use to do X" should be removed from the FAQ, or perhaps replaced with a suggestion of the preferred wordings. (How instead of with what). Questions that are against this ban should be simply edited, instead of being closed.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The purpose of Closing a question is to give the OP (or whoever wants to help out) an opportunity to edit it into a more appropriate question. It's not an end state.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While, yes, the answer to "How can I do X" is very often "Use app Y", but not always. We've had questions here where the asker had an issue that was easily handled by functions built in to the OS directly or just by using an app they already had a little differently. "I need an app that does X" is the classic [XY Problem](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378), where the app is "Y". Ask about X!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to pile on, asking for app recommendations here is like asking for software recommendations on [su]. Here's what [they say about that](http://meta.superuser.com/questions/5372/how-do-i-ask-a-question-that-may-require-recommending-software).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Its all arguable and definitely not binary. Simplest example -  the link you provided states "What is an alternative to x-software?" "They really don't solve any problems". I want to draw, I cant buy Photoshop, i ask for cheaper/free alternatives. While this particular example could be easily googled up, it shows the flaw in logic. I have a problem, and answers to my question solve it. As for the XY problm, there are many forms of it, and the one adressed with the rule banning "app X" questions is the only one adressed in the FAQ. Maybe the FAQ should address the XY problem isntad.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Im quite sure I wont convince anyone, still, Id like to voice my opinion and hear counter arguments if there are any. One of them, the one you mentioned in the second comment, is quite easy to debunk. Only the most malicious formalist would not answer "you should use a hammer instead of a rock" to the question "what kind of rocks is best for hammering nails". And in "app X" questions, the background is pretty obvious, contrary to many other XY problem examples. If I asked for an app for tagging and sorting images, its obvious what i need. If android had it, you could recommend it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We don't do app recommendations. [webapps.se] doesn't do web app recommendations. [su] doesn't do software recommendations. [so] doesn't do programming library recommendations. [Stack Exchange doesn't like shopping questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Certainly you are entitled to voice your opinions. You are a member of the Community and your voice is as valid as anyone else's. I'm just trying to point out that you're swimming against the tide here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know im a bit swimming against the tide, but it is said that only dead fish swim with it ;) but you must agree, the specific type of question we are talking about is not a typical shopping Macbook Air vs. Macbook Pro question, now is it. Also I will still be pointing to the fact that in this particular type of question (app x) the how and what app are just about the same. I am not advocating the allowance of poor and useless question. Im advocating not closing qeustions on the principle. I only rephrased my question mentioned earlier, im still asking the same - so the first one was valid too


















It's a problem all over, not just here. Not five minutes ago I voted to close a programming question on Web Applications. And how about all of the "how do I fix this non-programming Android issue" questions that have been closed on Stack Overflow? (And believe me, there have been a lot more of them than development questions here.)

There are any number of helpful hints to guide potential Askers to the right place. You probably don't remember because you've been around for a while, but there's a dialog that new users need to click through before posting that says basically: I have read what this site is about, I see it again here right in front of me, and this is the right place, so let me ask my question. There's the FAQ, of course. And the "Ask Question" page does give guidance, at least until your reputation meets a certain threshold.

The problem, and it's not limited to here, is that people don't read on the Web. The only thing that keeps sites on topic is swift, efficient, ruthless moderation when people post off-topic stuff. (Remember Usenet?) That's because people will post off-topic stuff; it can't be stopped.

Don't forget, we also have the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment tag, which has been left on here as kind of a "honeypot" to make it easier to find off-topic questions. (The assumption being, of course, that anyone doing development would see that tag and use it, in spite of the tag wiki excerpt explicitly saying that such questions are off-topic.) Unfortunately, the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/applicationsapplications tag (which is terribly misused and abused and https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/678/help-needed-in-the-applications-tagis in dire need of cleanup) is almost always one of the sample tags suggested and, since they're developing an application, must be the tag they want, right?

So, yes, it's annoying and I wish these people would get a clue. Don't worry about the Moderators' time, though. We don't need to waste it with simple stuff like this. Just continue to vote to close. Downvote them for wasting your time. (Enough downvotes—six, I believe—and the question drops off the front page.) If you're feeling kind, point them to the FAQ.

But you should probably resign yourself to the fact that no matter how many clues and help and speed bumps we put in front of new users (and there are quite a few), some people are going to post off-topic stuff. All we can hope to do is educate them, hopefully educate people who see their off-topic question and so won't repeat the mistake, and close them down without mercy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I should probably also mention that you should have a look at [metase]. [so] has a magnitude greater amount of activity than here. There have been a lot of discussions on how to help new users and to ameliorate off-topic and otherwise undesirable questions.


















Ideally, there would be a separate answer for the different build.

However, I think it's not unreasonable to leave both questions open. The questions have a clear difference, even if it's only slight. If it turns out that the answer to both are basically the same, they can always be merged later. It would be good to put explicit links between them, as well as some language saying why they're not duplicates.

(Close-as-duplicate is more for situations where you have "How do I make the turtle move in Logo?" and "In Logo, how do I move the turtle?" questions, which are obviously just different phrasings of the same question.)

However, the question I mentioned has been closed now as a duplicate, which seems to indicate more people disagree with you?

All the OP needs to do is point out why his/her question isn't a duplicate. The Bounty isn't a bad idea, though.

Badges, on the other hand, are more commonly related to specific posts or actions and make more sense being separate for each site.


















I think we should work on a common policy that we all agree on about closing questions as "too localized". A new meta post with different suggestions about when a question is obviously of no use would surely help to find reasonable criteria.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Exactly. I recently notice someone is marking a lot of new questions (from the very same day) as "too localized" -- where there are not any access stats available, and the question itself *at least to me* does not appear to be "too localized". Clear "guidelines" would for sure be very helpful!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I\ll wait a few days and then create the meta question if there is no objection.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For the "new Meta post" you suggested, see: [What makes a question "too localized?"](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/1254/16575) -- ooops, that was parallelized... Feel free to re-use the linked one (or close it then as duplicate, whatever).


















Based on the Meta question https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1250/16575Old questions w/o answers and low view count we came to the conclusion: It is often quite unclear what makes a question "too localized". So we need some (at least more) clear rules on which a decision can be based. Let's start with what we have:

This question is unlikely to help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet. For help making this question more broadly applicable, see the FAQ.

Which is a rather broad description: How can one tell the mentioned criteria? Some clear numbers would be helpful. Let me give some examples of what are IMHO clear candidates:

a question bein 6 month or older, having neither answers nor comments1, and less than 10 views/month on average
a question on a device available only in one country AND connected to other very local criteria (e.g. just happens with one small provider)
a question on a very specific situation which one rarely mets ("I want to sync my calendar with a [very unknown software] on my [very unknown OS]", to construct a drastic example)

1 asking the OP for additional details/making the point clearer not counted, as those are mostly in the context "what do you really want? what is the question here?"
Can we have more clear examples in this Meta page, which then could be linked either to the FAQ link given in the quoted text, or even directly included with this text? Could you please list up things you would say are very clear -- and we make a summary later (maybe even in a different Meta question, to get it clear and easy for all readers, and link back to our brain-storming here)?
Also it would be interesting to list up what is frequently misinterpreted as being "too localized". Today's example: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/36210/16575Why I am unable to check balance on BSNL Mobile in Android Phone? This message was not yet 1 hour old, having had 12 views, and was already marked by one vote-to-close as "too localized". My guess is: One special (Japanese?) provider plus one special DualSIM phone gave the reasons of being "localized". But what if tomorrow we find the question has been viewed 2.500 times within 24 hours? "unlikely to help any future visitors"? Though it might be geographically localized on a first glance, it might turn out a general DualSIM problem applying world-wide!
So to sum up:
Could you all please list up, from your personal experience and feeling, what are clear indicators for a "too localized" question -- and what are clear indicators agains a message being "too localized", though it might look different on a first glance -- so we can "distill" easily understandable guidlines from it?

Please note the last criterium alone is not enough, as it might turn out to apply more broadly. That's why it should not be closed immediately but first watched for "access" (views) and, maybe, comments pointing to that direction.

Thanks :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe it's hard to draw a line: Which questions are considered to be connected to a very local criteria?.

Maybe I should rephrase this answer as what I meant: **New questions are never candidates for "too localized"** (wait at least for 1 month)?



















"How do I root X?" questions should never be closed as "too localized". The only (vote) close reason for such questions is "exact duplicate".

There seem to be very specific devices around. And who cares about "how to root" some 1st generation device (Q from 2+ years ago with, say, 200 views, for a device that might have been around then but nobody uses anymore nowadays).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I consider the "How to root" questions very important for this site. While it's true that there are some devices out there where "nobody cares", I find it hard to draw a line. And on the other hand, unanswered questions aren't really a problem. They don't consume any resources or so. That's why I am very careful about that topic.


















A question should never be closed as "too localized" unless it is at least 1 month old. Even if it looks quite localized on a first glance, that could be due to the phrasing -- while under-the-hood a real important problem is addressed. This might not be obvious during the first hours/days, but later on due to increased views, or a re-phrasing, or some comments...

If you feel 1 month is too much, please say so in your comments. But IMHO we should not drop that margin below a week for sure.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 from me. That should help prevent spamming of reviewing close votes that has TL in there :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree.  The age of the question has no impact on the content of the question.  Closure is not a permanent state; edits that improve the question such that it should be re-opened means we should re-open it, that's all.  If someone doesn't understand the question or is unsure whether it should be closed then they should not VTC.


















I noticed someone recently edited https://android.stackexchange.com/a/30117/11190one of my answers (along with the question for which the answer applied). The only edit this person made was to change the word 'wifi' to 'Wi-Fi'.

I understand that the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fiwikipedia entry prefers 'Wi-Fi' as the proper terminology, but it also says it can be spelled 'wifi' (as well as 'WiFi' [no dash]).

Editing an answer simply to change wording is questionable at best, since the editor is not actually clarifying anything with the edit.

And I would argue that it makes the question and answer worse, because almost anyone would first search for 'wifi' before trying 'Wi-Fi', if they even think to search for the term with a dash at all. I tried a search with just 'wifi', and the question and my answer no longer show up.

Should these edits be reversed? Or does it make sense to change all 'wifi' to 'Wi-Fi'? If the latter, could the search engine be revised to smartly search both terms?

I do realize that the preferred 'tag' in SE is 'wi-fi', with the dash. However, I think most users will search for 'wifi', no dash.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the word 'wifi' be changed to 'Wi-Fi' in questions and answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think most search engines will handle wifi and wi-fi synonymously.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*I think most users will search for 'wifi', no dash.* full ack. And even if Wikipedia prefers a different spelling -- I'd say the most common spelling is WiFi. As to @Flow's comment: Sure they do. So there would be no need for the described edit, right? Should such edits then be rejected?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Yes, any suggested edit that is too minor should be rejected with the "too minor" reason :P.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead, what would be the best way to reject the edit? I have never seen such an option (likely since I am not a moderator, or lack the rep requirements). However, if I edit all the posts again to change "WiFi" back to their original spelling, that would just be another useless edit on top of the already useless edit. Should all the changes be flagged for a moderator?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this case, Sachin has enough reputation that his edits don't need to be approved.  You also [need 2000 rep to approve suggested edits](http://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/edit).  I'm not sure if you can approve edits to your own posts before that, but when you view the post it will show `edit (1)` rather than the normal `edit` link when something is pending.


















I prefer WiFi as it looks much cleaner. I believe they should be edited to WiFi.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Though I also prefer WiFi, I see no reason to edit a post *just for that*. Of course, if there are other corrections to be made, we could fix this along the way.


















I have seen that there are so many questions that has acceptable answers without the OP has not accepted. I have seen this issue has addressed to a certain extent in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1250/23379some questions. Yet, it is about unanswered questions. 

So is there a way to notify users who have questions with no accepted answers to check their questions? If not (which I believe so), wouldn't it be better to implement a feature like that? 

With that, they can either give their feedback or they can share if they have found an answer themselves. (this will help future users to get a certain or verified answer) 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there a way to notify users of their new answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The OP of a question receives a global inbox notification for every answer posted. I don't know that doing anything beyond this would really be all that helpful, since it would feel more like pestering than anything else (or encourage people to accept answers that perhaps did not actually solve their problem).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. If particular answer does not solve the problem, OP should at least give their feedback by way of a comment or so. That's the idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5When a post has been migrated from one StackExchange site to another, then it is possible that the user has no account yet on that site. So that means that (s)he will not receive updates about this? Means no accepted answer?


















No question should ever be closed as "too localized" because of the question stats alone (view count/answers/age/...), as it only solves a cosmetic problem (low accepted answer ratio on Android Enthusiasts) and does not provide any benefit.

Instead only the content of a question should be used as reason to close a question as "too localized" (e.g. because it's clearly only a problem caused by a small regional carrier).

Of course, exceptions may exist (and I saw some). So would you consider a re-phrasing to "because of the question stats **alone**"?


















In my Answer A, I would post a link to Answer B. It would look like:


  Check out https://android.stackexchange.com/a/4967/22441this answer. It can fix your problem.


In cases where I'm not sure Answer B would completely fix the problem, I would post the link as a comment to the Original Poster's question, telling them to try it out first. In case it does work, I just leave it as is, and give away the points to whoever will post the correct or actual answer.

No.
Per https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/22233/21960this answer from Jeff Atwood at Meta Stack Exchange:

Expletives are not acceptable behavior on meta or any other Stack Overflow site. If you can't effectively communicate what you need to say without resorting to lowest common denominator cursing, then keep it to yourself.
If you use expletives, you will get a warning.
If you continue to use expletives, you will be placed on http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/timed suspension.

While Jeff has left Stack Exchange this is still official policy.
It would also be considered a violation of the https://android.stackexchange.com/help/be-niceBe Nice policy https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/2408391. I would suggest that profanity, especially if directed at someone, falls under "Rudeness and belittling language", while run-of-the-mill "blue" language just in general is covered under "Don't be a jerk - Inappropriate language or attention".

I have a question but I am unclear about which https://android.stackexchange.com/tagstags to use.

I want to ensure that my question is categorized so the people with the most expertise/interest related to my issue are most likely to see it.

I also want to be a good Stack Exchange Netizen and so want to avoid "meta tags" (whatever those are).

I have read https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1181/how-to-ask-android-questions-the-smart-wayHow To Ask Android Questions The Smart Way but that specifically does not cover question tags.

How do I choose the right tags for my question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can I tag my question in the most effective way?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for Meta-Tags, "whatever they are", see [What are "meta tags"?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/1284/16575) ;)


















Meta tags are tags that describe the question itself rather than the topic of the question.  They're so named in the same way our Meta site is named — here we have questions about the site rather than questions within the site's topic.
Imagine we had the following question:

What's the best custom ROM for the Galaxy S?

An appropriate tag would be https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsung-galaxy-ssamsung-galaxy-s or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/custom-romcustom-rom since that's what the question is asking about.  Even https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/best-romsbest-roms would be correct if were using such a tag.
On the other hand, a tag like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/subjective-questionsubjective-question would be a Meta tag because it describes only the question itself, despite accurately doing so.
An example from Stack Overflow is https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/homeworkhomework.  All that should matter is the development issue that's being asked about, not the reason the development is being done (school, work, hobby, whatever).  Meta tags distract from solving the problem.

Where possible, it should be tagged with:


Device Model (e.g. samsung-galaxy-s-2)
Android Version (e.g. 4.0-ice-cream-sandwich)
Related apps (e.g. chrome-for-android)
Issues / Topics (e.g. keyboard)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure this information should be mentioned in the question. But not always it is useful to use the corresponding tags. To give a simple example with your data: "How can I create bookmarks with Chrome?" is surely not depending on device and Android version (as for the tags) -- except you know there's a special Chrome version for that combination. However, it cannot hurt to include with your *question text* that you use a SGS2 running ICS, even in this case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Same applies to "related apps" in cases where that's not really applyable. Example for this: "How do I root my SGS2?". In this case, device model and Android version *are* required tags, as is the topic ("root" in this case). But there are no related apps *for the tag* (as the questioner does not know the rooting-app to be used, or the question would not be asked ;) Sure, in this case it falls into the category "not possible", so it's not the best example -- but you get the idea. -- One still could argue "use all possible, and let the experienced remove unneeded ones"...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Good points, which is why I said "Where possible.." or "Where applicable..". I guess the keywords or main topics of the question should be considered when tagging. Then again, not everybody is familiar on its proper usage (the same with twitter hashtags) or what the tag for the topics are. So, I suppose it's up to the Community to correct the tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Careful about encouraging people to always put a device tag on their question, previous consensus was not to do it unless the question was definitely specific to that one device model: http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/260/should-we-discourage-phone-model-tags-in-non-phone-specific-questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed. The reason I posted this question is so that we can discuss and come to an agreement on a rational tagging strategy/policy.


















Please omit the device and Android version tag if you are sure that the question is not specific to a particular device or Android version.

I am aware of https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/264/440Matthews answer, and I agree that those tags shouldn't be used if the question isn't specific to the tag. But it's difficult to tell if a problem is really device/version specific. It's hard to tell for the asker and it's hard for the user who wants to retag the question. That's why I think that we should go with an "in doubt go with the device/version tag" policy.

I even think that it's hard to educate the users otherwise.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say this is valid for all tags: if you're sure they don't apply, don't apply them to your question. Device-tags is the one thing (doesn't hurt to mention the device in the question, though) -- Android-Version is the same thing (e.g. when asking for how-to-do this/that on Android, a version tag makes not much sense).


















Here's a project for us non-Moderators:

The tag https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multiple-accountsmultiple-accounts appears to be covering much of the same ground as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multi-usermulti-user.

The tag wiki of the latter currently states:


  Multi-user is a term that defines an operating system, computer program, or a game that allows use by more than one users of the same computer at the same time. Android 4.2 Jelly Bean brought multi-user support to Android tablets.


So, it looks like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multiple-accountsmultiple-accounts is a candidate to be a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multi-usermulti-user, but it's not currently "clean" enough to force a re-tag.

Here's the project: Go through each of the (currently) 21 questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multiple-accountsmultiple-accounts and retag them appropriately. At the very least, anything that is tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multiple-accountsmultiple-accounts and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multi-usermulti-user the former is redundant and should be removed. Also, if there are other issues with the question, fix those too.

Once cleaned up to the degree possible we can either let the tag die, set it as a synonym, or, if there are still some questions using it, define an appropriate wiki definition.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag cleanup needed: [multiple-accounts] and [multi-user]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aren't they distinct? To me it looks like this: [tag:multiple-accounts] => e.g. 2+ Google Play accounts on a single user, or e.g. latitude problems with multiple devices (c.f. [here](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/15012/google-latitude-and-multiple-devices-how-to-prevent-location-jumping)). In contrast: [tag:multi-user] => Android 4.2+ multiuser questions.

(Certainly no more useful than "accounts".) That's part of the reason I brought it up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, makes sense. I'm game! Then all [tag:multiple-accounts] should be changed to just [tag:accounts] too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Cleanup is done. This question cannot be edited.

I draw your attention to the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/emulatoremulator tag.

The tag wiki (not so clearly) says that this is tag is for questions about (a/the) Android Emulator.

Unfortunately, it's being used for questions about any sort of emulator. (J2ME was the most recent one I saw.)

It seems to me that if nothing else the language in the tag wiki needs to be more specific.

It may make more sense to leave this as a more "generic" emulator tag and to create https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-emulatorandroid-emulator. Even so, I expect to get a lot of cross-pollination.

Anybody have any other ideas?

Considering you are a good source of information relating anything Android. Do you really suggest that in this most important question of Android life I should resort to those other not-so-good forums?

And full ack to your remark to superuser: Don't be offended, we didn't want to trick you for bad -- but giving the example yourself you might easier understand the purpose, that was the idea behind it.


















Is it possible, that when asking a question, a kind of a check to say something like 

Tick here, and Yes, I have read the FAQ and acknowledge that the question fits the criteria in order to enforce the user to read the darn thing prior to posting. 

All too often OPs are not actually reading the FAQ hence getting shot-down with vote-close and saying its off-topic...

It won't work.

Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going.  If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it.

My opinion, which I've expressed in the past:

Although the Galaxy Nexus is an Android phone off-the-shelf, I don't think that installing or using Ubuntu for phones is within the scope of our site. Questions related to running Ubuntu along side Android (in a chroot environment with VNC, for example) seem okay to me since Android is involved in the process, and we've handled a few here in the past.

Using Ubuntu for phones requires completely replacing the Android OS with Ubuntu. At that point I think we've left the realm of Android Enthusiasts and entered into the realm of http://askubuntu.comAsk Ubuntu. We're built around the Android ecosystem, and though the device may have been originally intended to run Android, using it for a completely different purpose seems beyond our expertise and our scope. I wouldn't expect a Microsoft support forum to help me install Ubuntu on a desktop because it originally came with Windows - I'd expect an Ubuntu community to help me.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interestingly, at [apple.se], asking about putting an Apple OS on non-Apple hardware is specifically _off-topic_.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1: Interesting. I wonder if that's because of the licensing nastiness that comes with Apple's operating systems. Using it on non-Apple hardware is (from what I understand) explicitly forbidden in the EULA, even if you were to, for example, go buy a physical copy of OS X.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user1 I guess that is because it is a "hackintosh" question, as explained above by eldarerathis, it is definitely a growing community however. In fact Michael Dell asked Apple if he could sell Dell computers preinstalled with Mac OS, which they denied. Apple is a "closed ecosystem", whereas Ubuntu, Android, are Open Source highly customisable environments. IMHO Ubuntu on a phone should be asked on the Ubuntu site, for one simple reason - it is Ubuntu, doesnt matter which device it is running onb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, I know the whys and wherefores.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/38019/is-it-possible-to-hard-brick-nexus-7-with-software-means-or-a-wrong-series-of-cI'm speaking about this one.

The essence of the question is:

"Is Nexus 7 truly unbrickable (without touching hardware)?"

The question is important (for obvious reasons), and not rhetorical (for reasons even more obvious).

So, what's wrong?



Or should I ask a dozen questions first, starting with:

"Nexus 7: what a bootloader is and how does it differ from boot?"

-- and then try to figure it out myself?

Heck, isn't this a "Q&A site"??
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok. How is this not real?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Easy: Because this question is not answerable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy: easy?? What do you mean by "not answerable"? If someone issues `fastboot erase bootloader` and then reboots the Nexus 7, will it be hard-bricked? (it appears, yes, but I'm still not sure, hence the question, pal)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you already know it's brickable, the question makes even less sense. And if you don't know, you never can be sure. There's no such thing as 100% proof that something can *NOT* be broken. So the question will, most likely, fall into the category *Chatty, open-ended questions*, which is off topic according to the [FAQ].b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy If you read my comment, you'll see that I don't know for sure if Nexus 7 is hard-brickable with software means, or not. The question starts with the same statement, giving links to threads where quite experienced people give essentially opposite answers to it. The presence of those links (and the rationale for the question's existence) makes the question somewhat bulkier than a simple "is Nexus 7 hard-brickable with a laptop and a USB cable?", bot does not make it "chatty".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Besides, if there really is a known way to hard-brick the device by the described means, the question is not open-ended -- there exists an answer to it (which, again, I would like to see -- see my previuos comment) -- and thats exactly why I am asking my question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After all asking questions only when there's a guarantee an answer exists would be a strange means to avoid open-ended questions, right? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's a difference not to know whether an answer exists -- or to know in advance there cannot be a definite answer. For the former: agreed, of course :) But then it might still be closed as soon as it turns out to be leading that way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy OK: so the title "Is it possible (with software means) to put Nexus 7 in a state in which it cannot be made to boot with any _currently known_ software means (i.e. effectively hard-brick)?" will do?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This I'd call at least border-line -- as you'd either have to expect some all-knowing user -- or turn it into a "poll". There are no *facts* to give (except someone happens to know such a possibility). It might still be theoretically possible. But at ASE, we deal with *facts* -- with *problems and their solutions*. This question would still fall into the category *Speculative questions*, and thus be off topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Ok, I already thought about it, the all-knowing user obstacle can be easily removed, what about "Is there a known way to put Nexus 7 (with software means) in a state from which there's no _currently known_ way to make it boot (i.e. essentially hard-brick)?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If there is such a way, and someone knows it, he will stand up and point to the dangerous sequence of commands and actions. If not, the question will stay unanswered (but still be a valid one, as one to which there may be an answer, as we agreed above) :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So your goal is to brick your device? ;) I'd suggest you switch over to [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25/android) (that's where *discussion* should take place, not here).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy My goal is to know whether I can accidentally brick my device (as I state in my question), chat is of no help here.
Putting it straight: do you find the suggested title appropriate?


















What circumstances is a general all-round "yes you can" or "no you can't" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device?

A question like "Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use).

Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not asking for either plain "Yes" or "No", but rather about is there a possiblity the device will end in a state that requires sending it back to ASUS after a sequence of cammands and actions usually done during flashing ROMS (and the question specifically speaks about that, have you read it through?). Then, since there're conflicting statements on the matter (as I posint out in my question, again, -- see the links), I ask what I ask for: either tell me that the device is "ubrickable" (_and also telll why_), OR point to the dangerous sequence of commands and actions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Again, the threads on the internet look silent on the topic I'm interested in (at least several hours of googling and reading gave me the opposite opinions I point to in my question). I strongly doubt, ASUS support will answer this question, too :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Putting it short: I have made some prelimenary research, and know what I am asking for; if you guys are not ok with current wording, I can possibly make it better, but the essence of the question stays there, roughly: "Is there a known way to put Nexus 7 (with software means, i.e. during ROM flashing, bootloader unlocking or rooting) in a state from which there's no currently known way to make it boot (i.e. essentially hard-brick)?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@mlvljr "Is there a way to recover from `fastboot erase bootloader`?" is an answerable question. "Is it possible to recover from all possible actions that might harm the device software/firmware in ways that haven't been specified?" isn't an answerable question, it's just too general.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok, catch you on that :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Edited my question.


















Alright, Am trying to help troubleshoot this https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/38176/web-page-not-available-please-helpOP's question, and the fact that the OP has a very low rep, and thus a new-comer on the scene.

Is there anyway of getting that OP to join the chat site to minimize comments that end up long and winded due to the OP being vague about and not knowing how/what to do to help us troubleshoot?

Basically, TL;DR; With a rep score < 20 (or minimum requirement of rep count to enter chat site) to move the comments into chat...How to do it? Or deal with it?

This sort of thing would more than likely result in question being closed for "too chatty"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have called it quits with the OP in question... I tried.. :)


















Unfortunately, I think there's simply not an ideal solution for situations like this at the moment. You can, however, upvote/favorite/bounty https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/100291/invite-low-rep-users-to-participate-in-chatInvite low rep users to participate in chat over on MSO if you'd like (proposes allowing higher rep users to invite lower ones into chat).

I'd say the best course of action currently is to just hash out as much as you can in the comments, then try to get that information edited into the question. If you reach that point then you can always flag comments for deletion as "obsolete", or flag one of the comments with a custom note along the lines of "every comment after this one is now obsolete etc etc". That way the comments can get cleaned up and the information will be retained.

And, of course, you can encourage the OP to try their hand at answering some questions since you only need 2 answer upvotes to get chat privileges.

Sorry for the late answer. There should be a notification when the question is closed (at the same time that the submit button is disabled).

I assume the following is what happened:

Roughly around the time you posted this, we http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/05/revamped-notifications/revamped our notification system, and during this time, there was a bug which caused the notifications (like the "the question has been closed" one) not to be displayed.

This bug was already fixed when you posted this bug report, but given the time frame, I assume your browser cache still had the JavaScript file with the bug in it at that point. Sorry about that.

In https://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/editPrivileges, it says I need 2000 Reputation points to be able to edit questions and answers.

However, at my current level below 2000 points, I am already able to do this. Or, is my understanding wrong?

Are you sure that you are able to make edits that don't need prior approval before they are applied?

Every user can make 'suggested edits' but if you have >2000 rep you are don't need to get the approval of the community first. In fact you should then be able to review suggested edits yourself.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see. So there's a review process. I get it now. :)


















So I'm seeing a bunch of suggested edits come through the review queue where the only thing being changed is the removal of "thanks" or "TY" or "Regards".

Isn't that the definition of "too minor"?

I've been rejecting them when I've seen them, but several other users are accepting these edits.

Yes, I know we're not supposed to put such signoffs on our posts, just like we're not supposed at "Hi!" or "Greetings" or "Please help" at the beginning of our posts.

It seems to me that editing a post just to remove those things and not fix anything else at all is not productive. Especially when the person making these edits is getting reputation points for edits that don't improve very much.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aren't edits to remove "thanks" and "regards" too minor?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I accepted 2 or 3 where I didn't see anything else needing to be fixed.  In general though, users without edit privileges should not be making such minor edits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was asking myself this question as well from time to time -- also with some "minor spelling fixes". Most times I accepted them, though, as they made the entire post looking much cleaner. The rep received is minor as well, and sometimes it is hard to tell... Of course I'll adjust my behaviour to the consense ;) Currently I'm going with Flow's method/answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perfect example this morning, 3 edits in the approval queue, all three just remove the person's and leave "Thanks" (where it previously said "Thanks, **name**") - apart from being totally minor it actually makes them worse!  http://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/12941 http://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/12939 http://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/12940b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even worse, those posts were from 2010.


















The thing with "too minor" edits is a good point.

AFAIK the background of this restriction is to prevent <2000 rep users from gaming the system by making a lot of small and easy edits that don't completely fix a post.

Edits should fix all issues of a post. Not just the minor ones. But if there were only minor ones that needed to be fixed and got fixed with the suggested edit then I tend to approve the edit.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't say it's *gaming the system*, as the gain of 2pts / edit is too small to be of real value. To get points, answering questions is much easier and rewarding in fact. When I see a minor edit of a user that just started to contribute, I accept it in a manner of *I value your work, thanks. Maybe come back and do more next time*, i.e. improving minor edits. Especially for new editors it's not a good experience to get the very 1st edit rejected. It's not that this site is overwhelmed with editors, so let them do it even if it's just small improvements.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If there's a regular user like what's the case recently, I think it's appropriate to reject one or another with a "please fix the other things as well". I also tend to reject edits for questions that will be closed or for answers that very probably will be deleted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMHO the best reason why one would reject an edit is to tell the users that he/she should fix every aspect (as good as possible) of the post.


















Am using Chromium version 24.0.1312.52 (175374) under ArchLinux, and have noticed an obscure thing, every-time I post a comment or an answer, it seemingly "jumps"...

Let me explain:


I post a comment or an answer, as of "right now" (at the moment I submit), for example 23:45, Chromium says "x minutes ago", (in line with the previous example, "t0mm13b - 14 mins ago") the minute I post the comment, same applies for answers... where x is so far off (either in past or future...)


Has anyone else noticed this or is it a bug in the browser?

I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag. 

I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site.

The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?

This question has been asked multiple times at http://meta.stackoverflow.comMeta Stack Overflow for a variety of projects/tools/libraries. (Here's probably the definitive question and answer: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3966/is-it-okay-to-use-stack-overflow-as-the-support-forum-for-a-product-or-projectIs it okay to use Stack Overflow as the support forum for a product or project? )

Part of the problem is that there's a good chunk of "support" that falls outside of the realm of what Android Stack Exchange is about. Feature requests, for instance. Bug reports is another. Those questions, should they get asked here, will be ruthlessly downvoted, closed, and deleted. That's not the sort of experience you want your users to have.

That said, I think it's a good idea for you to let your users know that you actively monitor the tag for your app(s) here. Just don't try to make this the "official support forum" for it.

Looks good, but I miss the info graphic with the 4 circles Wiki, Blog, Digg and ? where Stackexchange is the point in the middle. It always reminded me that I can use Stackexchange sites to document Q&A that may be relevant to other users as well by simply answering my own question in one step.

I have a question I'd like to ask, but I'm not sure if it fits within the Android Enthusiasts policy, so I thought I'd post the question here to see if it is acceptable to post on the actual site.


  There is a google documentation spec that defines what a device must
  be capable of in order to be granted the use of "Android (TM)" for
  compatibility.
  
  I noticed that in Section 7.3.7 that devices should not have a
  thermometer, and if they do, it should only measure CPU temperature.
  It is not allowed in any way to measure any other temperature (ex body
  heat or ambient/room temperature).
  
  Is there a reason Google forbids thermometers? Would this type of
  sensor be too inaccurate and thus bring the perceived quality of
  Android down (likened to a neighborhood ordinance to keep all lawns
  mowed)?"
  
  Referenced question that talks about the spec (but not why):
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6985396/is-there-any-android-api-to-find-sense-room-temperature-programmatically-in-andrhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6985396/is-there-any-android-api-to-find-sense-room-temperature-programmatically-in-andr

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this an acceptable question for AE? "Why does the android documentation forbid devices with external thermometer sensors?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From a link your linked SO question, support for an [Ambient Temperature Sensor](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE) was added in API level 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Seems like it is supported, and isn't banned any more? So regardless of whether it would fit, the question seems redundant now?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for the answer to your question, it's speculative, but I guess it is because there is a lost context here. The document the quote is taken from is a compatibility suite, in a section describing an API for getting the temperature of the device. It is probably meant to prevent manufacturer from abusing it for ambient temperature instead, which will create a compatibility nightmare (and possibly even damaging the device). In short, the documentation forbids the use of this particular API for reporting ambient temperature, not forbidding ambient temperature sensor in general.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LieRyan That sounds very plausible. It makes much more sense that they would want the API to have a specific function, as opposed to what I thought (google dictating that Android smartphones must never ever have external thermometers).

In case you flagged a question incorrectly*, would it be possible for you to remove that flag yourself, before a moderator sees it? If not, how could you notify others that it was an incorrect flag?

* It could be considered an incorrect flag, if after clarifying, you realize that the post is valid.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it possible to remove a flag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think that this is possible as of now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Worst case scenario, ping one of us in chat


















No, it's not possible.

If you're concerned that a Moderator might act on your flag in error, you can always flag again using the "Other" option to explain the error, but I would recommend against that.


Trusted users (> 10k reputation) can see some flags, but not the custom flags, so your explanation won't reach them.
Moderators can only dismiss all flags on a post, not individual flags. So the Moderator won't be able to reject one and accept the other.


If you're worried about a "declined" flag on your Permanent Record™, don't. The occasional "declined" is no big deal. It's when there is a pattern of declined flags when there is a problem.

Close voters as of now can *retract* their vote but cannot vote for that post again. I can confirm that and I suppose you, being proactive on multiple [SE] sites would be knowing it as well. I've not tested this scene for reopen votes. // As for flagging with *Other* reason, I doubt that it is possible anymore or possible only under limited circumstances. I remember doing that and site showed me an error on the lines "You've already flagged this post" or something similar. I can't confirm though. Can you consider an edit in your post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord: I've removed the bit about not being able to retract a vote to close. As for not being able to use the "Other" option if you already have an active flag on a post, I am pretty sure that's a bug.


















No, the flag should be declined. The answer is salvageable by editing, there is no mod intervention needed. The user should have been simply downvoting the answer and leaving a comment like 


  We expect answers on Stack Exchange to be self-contained. At the very
  least, should that link no longer work this answer becomes useless. At
  the very least, please summarize the information to be found there
  (don't just copy-paste) and use the link as a source.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for the comment to be left. But considered that many of those link-only answers come from one-time-posters who not return, simply downvoting and commenting will do no good IMHO. At least not in cases where those answers come from users with "no rep".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why would downvoting and commenting cause any harm (or "do no good")? It's sufficient, reminds people that link only answers are no good idea, plus we keep the link as answer so the information about that link isn't lost.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Because most of those "link-only-posters" will not notice the downvotes. To my experience (I may be wrong here), most of them are just one-time-visitors. So the only ones seeing it's a bad idea are the others, who normally don't consider it a good idea either. As said, my opinion, and I might be wrong here.


















Yes, because the flag originated with a good intention. The mods have the ability to convert the answer to a comment and should do so.

But in case of a link-only answer there is absolutely no need for mod intervention. Every user with >125 rep can leave a comment and downvote the answer. It will also show up in the low answers review queue. There is no need to fill up the mod flag queue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It should be flagged as "Not an answer". In a lot of cases, it should be converted to a comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As stated in my comment to the "no" answer, we should differenciate: Does the answer come from a "no-rep-user" (i.e. a user with a rep of 1), a simple downvote even with comment won't be helpful as the poster most likely does either not return or not care (and simply use a new account). So here we *should* flag, to get it cleaned -- or clean it ourselves by expanding the content. Downvoting *should be considered*, otoh, if the user has a certain rep indicating he *might* care.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree.  It's too bad users want to push off editing work to someone else, but that's not what flags are for.  Flags are for things that **require** mod attention.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5**The problem with the low quality flag is that it's not very useful: The only thing it accomplished is offloading the editing work to the mod.** I see no need why questions with link-only answers should be flagged as "not an answer", because that is obviously not true: There is (maybe) an answer within the link.  Also there is no need to converted the answer to an comment. It seems like the wrong approach. If we want the ability for low rep users to simply comment with links we should give it to them and not by letting the mods do the conversion. **I would downvote this answer (if I could)**


















Can we get in the habit of re-tagging closed questions to have the appropriate tags?

I'm thinking specifically about Android development questions. If they are retagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment it'll make it easier to find and delete them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Retagging closed questionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we want to keep "off topic" questions on-site? In about 80% I favored vtd (vote-to-delete). Does it make sense to re-tag deleted questions -- then I will do so in the future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, we don't want to keep them. That's why I want to find them and vote to delete them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I heartily endorse anything that will help the 10k's to use their delete votes more easily/effectively.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, good thing! I made it my daily job to check those queues, especially the "closed" questions: those older than 2 days I give a closer look whether they should be deleted. If so, I immediately vtd. As that needs 3 votes, I encourage all of my fellow 10k's to at least check the "deleted" queue to "join in" -- but of course you are welcome to all the other queues as well ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also check the pile of closed messages as well, usually sorting by votes and going for those with the lowest votes. But that's not relevant to this question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Keep in mind that closed questions with a negative score and no answers will get auto deleted after a month or so.


















Done. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tnx! Re-tagging done as well, tag-wiki already was complete ;)


















Depends.

As to my experience, most link-only answers I've seen are made by some user12345 with a rep of 1 and no other posts. He either does not return anyway, or simply uses user23456 next time if simply downvoted. So no benefit here from downvoting. In this case, I can think of only two possible actions:


edit the post yourself and update it with the details from "behind the link"
flag it for moderator attention, reason "other", and ask to have it converted to a comment (or removed, if the link is already dead)


If the user has a rep of, say, 200+, downvoting will probably cause an update of the post, as he's much concerned about his rep. So in this case I'd recommend the "downvote + comment" method from https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1344/16575Flow's "No" answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see a benefit in downvoting: It shows other users that link-only answers are not a good practice. Converting to comment means just extra unnecessary work for the mods and deletion will possibly delete a good link (in the end, a link only answer is still better then no answer).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see a clear disadvantage in simply downvoting one-time-poster's link-only answers: It clutters our site. I see your point in "showing bad examples", but IMHO we are already doing this a lot/too much. Good content gets harder to find/see this way. And those "bad examples" work much better with those who "have something to lose", as they have a real effect there in two ways: Visitors see "ah, those get downvoted" -- *and* the poster sees "oh, rep lost, need to fix". The one-timer's posts simply clutter our site, which is a too high price to pay IMHO.


















We already had https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/external-displayexternal-display so I merged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monitormonitor into it and created an https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/external-monitorexternal-monitor synonym.

I think https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monitoringmonitoring needs some work though, it's too vague — there are lots of unrelated things that you can monitor.  If everything is referring to process monitoring, perhaps we should rename the tag to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/process-monitorprocess-monitor?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe I was a little ambiguous in my reference here: I didn't mean everything is process-orientated there, what I meant was "hardware" (monitor=display) versus the "process of monitoring" (not restricted to the monitoring of processes). And with just 11 questions being tagged `monitoring`, I don't think we currently need more specific tags for this. Thanx for the other merge -- I didn't know we already had `external-display`...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy No, I wasn't confused by what you said, but I do think we need to split `monitoring` or perhaps remove it entirely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you remove it, I guess it will re-appear. I guess in a while we may have use for differentiation like cpu-monitoring, data-monitoring, process-monitoring, ressource-monitoring, etc. Currently it is hard to say which of those make most sense, IMHO. I will meanwhile add a tag wiki to make clear what it is about.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Frankly, I think "monitoring" isn't a very useful tag. Using it for three or four different types of "monitoring" won't clarify anything. If you want to ask a question about monitoring your CPU, tag it with [tag:cpu]. Data monitoring seems to be covered under [tag:data-monitor] _and_ [tag:data-traffic].


















Done, thanks for the cleanup! 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the merge! Cleanup just completed. Can you also merge-in the tag `copying` (just detected while cleaning up; about 8 entries left there)? Not sure if a synonym is needed here; it may not hurt, but might be confusing (copy files or copy-paste text?).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Most of those have been retagged to `copy-paste` and I created the synonym `text-copy` for it.  `copying` should fade away now :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, great -- so you can ignore my corresponding question on chat :) THANX! Excellent.


















What should the difference be between the two? Both deal with the startup/boot process of the device, and related issues. From the questions tagged such I cannot tell why they shouldn't use the other tag instead. Hence my request:


Merge https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bootboot (x9) into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/startupstartup (x9) or vice-versa (in that case, make sure the tag wiki of startup is not lost)
Make the "empty one" a synonym to the merge target

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge tags 'startup' and 'boot'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I tend to agree there's some redundancy, but I'm also inclined to think that `startup` is now kind of an obsolete/not useful tag. It may be best to simply retag questions with `startup` to either `boot` or `auto-start` as appropriate, then let it die off or something. My 2 cents, anyway.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see x65 and x19, not x9 and x9.  Agreed with eldarerathis as well.  `device-startup` could be a synonym for `boot`.  Also, get more rep so I don't have to blindly spam Approve on your tag wikis anymore :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead Oh, that brings me to another issue to keep in mind when counting: I was on the 'faq' tab, which I always counted as a "sorting" rather than a "restricting" algorithm. Switching to 'Newest' indeed shows more #/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis You've made your point, and I can agree to it :) However, this might make the 'startup' tag re-appearing from time to time -- hence I still keep up my "request" making it a synonym to 'boot' after cleanup. I will see to it that I go over all 'startup' question and re-tag as suggested, if the others agree?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess I'm just not sure if it would be a better synonym for `auto-start` or something along those lines (but yeah, it's probably not a bad idea to synonymize it with *something* so people won't use it). I could probably go either way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say make it a synonym to `boot`. Why? There is the `shutdown` tag as well, which then would correspond (see e.g. [this question](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/35341/)).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Finished: Re-tagged all questions but two (which I could not edit as they were merged).


















After having created the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/insufficient-memoryinsufficient-memory including tag excerpt and wiki, now used by 10 questions, during re-tagging I discovered the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/storage-fullstorage-full on the last question, which is used by 9 questions currently.

Both tags are not really equivalent (insufficient-memory directly refers to the "insufficient memory..." error, thus dealing exclusively with the devices' internal storage -- while storage-full is much broader (at least from its name, though ~80% of the questions tagged such seem to explicitly refer to "insufficient memory", and the remaining 20% at least implicitly).

My idea was to merge the two, and convert storage-full into a synonym for now. So if we really feel we need a separate tag by that name at a later point, it would be easy to retain. At the moment I do not see much sense in a separate broad "storage-full" tag (my, if the card is full one needs to delete something, right? Or buy a larger card).

Please keep insufficient-memory as the main tag / merge target, as it already includes a tag wiki with "first aid" as well as a wiki excerpt :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'storage-full' into 'insufficient-memory'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can't find any questions tagged [tag:insufficient-storage] did you mean [tag:insufficient-memory] ? Other than that sounds good, agree that [tag:storage-full] should be the synonymb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sorry: insufficient-memory... I'll update my Q... Done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd prefer to avoid the term "memory" when not referring to RAM, since it seems to cause confusion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead Go tell Google (or the Android team). The full error message is: `Internal memory space is low` or `insufficient memory available` (app-install via playstore). I fully agree the term "memory" does not apply in this context (as really, internal *storage* is meant). But if the error message speaks of "insufficient memory", what do you think a user will look for in tags?


















I respect that you want help others with re-opening your question. However our FAQ states that "shopping recommendations" are off-topic on Android Enthusiasts. 

In fact all type of recommendations do not fit your Q/A format. A better approach would be something like the already existing question https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/770/where-can-i-find-a-comparison-of-android-devices"Where can I find a comparison of Android devices?". The answers of this question also provide an answer to your question and the question is within the rules of our FAQ.

I personally can only recommend http://geekaphone.com/geekaphone: It allows the comparison of different smartphones including the Apple ones.

Sorry for short-circuiting your vote, but this seemed pretty clear-cut to me since most of the translation questions were in fact localization questions.  I've merged and synonymized.

I think https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/languageslanguages is alright to stay separate since it seems like a proper subset of localization, but I'm open to other options.

Good that someone (you) has a clear view on this :) I was tending to the same direction, or I wouldn't have asked. So what's left is me checking the tag wikis of the two remaining tags whether they might need some clearification. Will do so on this weekend (currently I'm a little in a rush). Thanks again!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy No problem, thanks again for all your work on our tags lately!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also no problem :)


















As I just wondered again about the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment tag (and why there are only so few questions tagged such), maybe a sum-up from the above might be helpful:
Some facts

development questions are off topic according to our FAQ, and thus get closed
as we have no interest in keeping off topic stuff on our site, we finally want to delete them
a question being closed does not automatically mean it should be deleted (thinking of duplicates etc.)
a question cannot be deleted unless it was closed for at least 2 days (or the poster of the question decides to delete it himself, or the want-to-be-deleter is a mod)

How we can deal with this

development questions get closed for being off topic, as usual
we are not simply closing them, but re-tag them https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment -- best as soon as such a question is unmistakingly identified, during the VTC process, when finding it in the https://android.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=closelist of closed questions (10k+ users), or when encountering them anywhere
from time to time, users with the necessary reputation thus can/will check the questions using the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment tag and vote-to-delete (or simply delete, in case of being a mod)

So here's probably the clue why there are always only few questions found using this tag: they simply get deleted :)
This way we 10k+ users can use our powers to support our moderators (and) keeping our site clean -- and not only we 10k+, but all users can participate here (e.g. re-tagging does not require a 10k+ but only 500+).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even people with reputation points below 500 can suggest new tags..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My intention was not about "new tags", but rather about tracking those off-topic stuff we want to delete -- as your question seemed to point at as well (development questions). Apart from that you're of course right that even first-timers could "add new tags".


















This is actually a result of a different scenario, but from the front page it's effectively indistinguishable from a normal Community♦ bump. What actually happened here was:


An https://android.stackexchange.com/a/41362/981incredibly juvenile and pointless "answer" was posted by a new account
Said account was destroyed, and the post deleted


In this situation, Community♦ (evidently) becomes the "owner" of the last modification to the post since it would otherwise end up being attributed to a non-existent account. In fact, clicking on the timestamp for the last activity on the front page will link you directly to the deleted answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well then. Unfortunately, three deleted answers on that question are from deleted accounts, so the auto-protect didn't kick in. Perhaps it should be applied manually.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user267: I agree. I just went and protected it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My fault not looking at the deleted answers. I guess it's because it was below another question that _had_ been bumped. I'll accept this as soon as the timer runs out.


















Obviously the two are related. But they are also not much frequented. So my question is whether we really need them both. I'd say https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-ussd-attackremote-ussd-attack (x2) could easily be referred to using https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ussdussd (x1) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/securitysecurity, so I'd suggest to make ussd the main tag, merging remote-ussd-attack into it and make the latter a synonym to the former.

While waiting for your opinions (or quick actions, if approved by our dear moderators), I meanwhile go tagging the other USSD related questions -- so please don't wonder if the mentioned numbers have changed :)

EDIT: Yikes, there's also the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dialer-codesdialer-codes (x13) tag to be considered. Are USSD codes to be classified as "dialer codes"? Should that be the merge-target instead?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What to do with the tags 'ussd' and 'remote-ussd-attack'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Skimming [Wikipedia's USSD page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data) (I'm not entirely familiar with this topic) I'm thinking that `dialer-codes` might be better separate, as it seems that there are dialer codes that are not necessarily USSD codes (I think?). Merging the other two into simply `ussd` seems sufficient. Am I off base in that analysis?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's in fact a difficult thing. There are 3 closely related terms: "USSD Codes" (`*1nn#`, optionally `*1nn*#` are access numbers for simple services. "Supplementary Service Codes" extend them (mailbox services and the like). These both together can be called "GSM Codes". All remaining codes are specific to either the provider, the manufacturer, the system (as e.g. Symbian's S60), or even the device. If you want to dig that deep, that is. For the "common user", these all are just "Secret Codes" :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To pick up my last edit in combination with your comment: I explicitly asked whether *USSD codes to be classified as "dialer codes"*, not vice-versa: An apple is a fruit, not necessarily the other way around :) But as said, that's an optional consideration. Main issue still is to merge `ussd` with `remote-ussd-attack` -- optionally giving the latter questions an additional `security` tag. If you can confirm that, I again will care for the "additional tag" so you can concentrate on the merge :)


















Both tags (https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/odexodex and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/deodexdeodex) cover each 2 questions currently. As one is just the opposite of the other, bot both deal with the same issue, I'd suggest making deodex a synonym to odex by merging the two -- as it once was done with "lockscreen" and "unlock-screen".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'deodex' with 'odex'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would the tag wikis then be combined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suggest to keep the tag wiki of `deodex`. It includes all what the wiki of `odex` has, plus a little more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good to me even though they are antonyms.


















Actually, activating "unknown sources" in the Android settings is for nothing else but side-loading. While technically there's a difference between activating that configuration option and performing the actual side-loading process, is this really a reason for having separate tags?

I vote to merge https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/unknown-sourcesunknown-sources (x3) into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/side-loadingside-loading (x15) and making the former a synonym to the latter.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'unknown-sources' to 'side-loading'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From [Al's answer](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/1387/16575) I see the merge might not be "optimal". If you (the mods) share his opinion, would you please "reject" this request -- or otherwise "process" it, so this question can be marked "done"? Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm marking this declined largely because of Al's reasoning in his answer (which I agree with). It seems feasible that you could ask a question about the "Unknown Sources" setting itself without getting into the specific act of sideloading ([I have Unknown Sources enabled on my phone, now what?](http://android.stackexchange.com/q/5316) is a decent example). It's probably a small set of questions, but having a tag for the actual option's name seems okay as it's a fairly prominent option. Since you did a good job of explaining this in the tag wiki, I think it's okay.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, I'm meanwhile willing to easily accept that. ATM I'm wondering more about non-market and side-loading... #D


















I say no. "Unknown sources" is (should be) about the setting. "Sideloading" is (should be) about the act of installing an app outside of the context of the Market/Play Store/etc.

They are related, sure, but I don't think they're the same.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you think of any question to be tagged "unknown sources" which would not deal with side-loading? Though I fully understand the difference (as pointed out in my question), I still hold this a pure theoretical difference not reflected by practical issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Where is the 'Unknown Sources' setting on my generic Chinese tablet?" "Do I need to turn on 'Unknown Sources' in order to use the Amazon Android Market?" "Will having 'Unknown Sources' unchecked protect me from most Android malware?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not perfect, but valid questions about the setting and not about side-loading.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which of these questions will not mention side-loading? "Where is the setting" usually continues with what the user wants to do. The "other markets" are side-loading apps to your device. Malware (in this context) will side-load. To me, that's not more than a point-of-view (of course, a valid one ;).


















Again I stumbled upon two synonymously used tags. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ledled (x14) is a little misleading (as it also might refer to the "led flash"), but all of the questions refer to the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/notification-lednotification-led (x3).

My suggestions:


merge 'led' into 'notification-led'
make 'led' a synonym to 'notification-led'


Number 2. might need discussion in case there are arguments concerning led-flash.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'led' and 'notification-led'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks like there actually are a few referring to the camera's LED flash. I see 3 right now: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/32938/whats-the-purpose-of-strobe-frequency-adjustment-in-torch, http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/26168/how-to-make-front-lamp-intependent-from-photo, http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1819/any-concerns-using-led-flashlight-apps. It does seem like a good idea to disambiguate `led`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh -- I thought I saw them at first, but could not find them later, so I edited this out of my original question. As the edit does not appear as such, I cannot roll-back: #0 should then have "re-tagging those to `camera-flash` (Done). I will do so now. Thanks for bringing them up!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can a tag be disambiguated? I had that in mind as well, but a tag is a tag: we either can 1) make it a synonym, 2) blacklist it, 3) ignore it, or 4) watch it and continuously re-tag. To me, 2+3 are no real options, and 4 is hard to practice (unless registering as a follower)...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Synonymizing is, to me, a form of disambiguation, since you then know that `led` specifically refers to whatever the synonym is (in this case, `notification-led` makes sense).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK -- so let's do it? I re-tagged the flashlight stuff, so all is ready for a merge. Also, would you be so kind to investigate my previous 4 tag-cleanup requests? They hang around for about 3 days now almost unnoticed ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll take a peek real quick, though I'm getting ready to leave work in ~15 minutes so any actual merging might wait until I actually get home a little later tonight.


















I merged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ledled into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/notification-lednotification-led and made the latter one the master.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! So I just added the tag wiki for the new master, also pointing out that "torch" and "LED flash" should use the `camera-flash` tag instead.


















Yes, I know there are also "internal sd cards", which might cause a little confusion here. But there's no tag for them. Instead, the tag wiki for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sd-cardsd-card (x394) clearly reads:


  For questions related to the external micro-SD card used by most Android phones to increase the amount of available storage.


There you are. So what is the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/external-sdexternal-sd (x8) for then -- unless we want to split things up between the two explicitly, creating an "internal-sd" tag, and arguing about "How to disambiguate the sd-card tag? Where should that synonym point to?" :)

I'd suggest to merge external-sd into sd-card. Whether we really need to make it a synonym after merging, I leave to the "executing mod" :)



As the comments raised that topic: "What to do with questions concerning the so-called 'internal sdcard' then?" Neither of us feels happy with that naming, but is was not us chosing it: it is not really an SDcard (in most cases, rather eMMC or the like). Despite of this,


newer devices use /sdcard as mount-point for this storage, placing the "real sdcard" to /sdcard/external_sd or the like
all forums, how-tos, manuals, whatever (you name it) are speaking of "internal SDCards", so a different term would cause confusion


terms like 'emmc-storage' would cause confusion (and might not always be "correct")
terms like 'flash-storage', 'phone-storage', 'device-storage', or 'internal-storage' could also apply to the area covered by /system (and sometimes are used referring to that explicitly, plus the latter is already used as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/internal-storageinternal-storage for exactly this)



Thus, as unhappy a term it might be, this would leave https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/internal-sdinternal-sd as almost the only useful option, and we should use it (I volunteer creating it and re-tagging the questions from our current 'sd-card' tag appropriately, so the rename could be done after that step). If someone comes up with a better name later on, we always can rename 'internal-sd' to something more appropriate.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'external-sd' into 'sd-card'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm fine with this merging (logical that `sd-card` should refer to actual SD cards), but part of me thinks that we may ultimately need an `internal-sd` (or similar) tag. Otherwise I'm not sure what else you would use to refer to the internal `/sdcard` mount point on devices that have both (e.g. the Xoom, the Galaxy S3). `internal-sd` seems icky though...maybe there's a better term.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As `internal-storage` would be ambiguous if used for that, I agree for an additional tag. All currently used storage tags are listed in the [storage tag wiki](http://android.stackexchange.com/tags/storage/info), and there is none for "internal sd". If agreed upon, I could create the `internal-sd` tag and walk through all Qs tagged "sd-card" to sort those out, report back here, and you could start the merge then?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Like I said, I'm okay with a new tag for that and I'm starting to think it may almost be necessary. If you have other ideas for naming it I'd be open to suggestions. I'm not all that enthusiastic about `internal-sd` simply because it's kind of a confusing phrasing (and it's not actually an SD card, so it could be a bit deceiving).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's exactly what makes me hesitating (with a clear tag name in mind, I would have gone straight ahead). Unfortunately, that's what manufacturers name it (just think of `/sdcard/external_sd`, which is still confusing me). But how about this suggestion: I go ahead with 'internal-sd' for now so we can clean-up "that mess", and as soon as we find a better name for that tag we can always rename it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis I just updated the question accordingly. Looks like 'internal-sd' really is the only choice left currently.


















I propose that https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-voice-actionsgoogle-voice-actions is marked as a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/voice-commandvoice-command. The former currently has 10 questions, the latter has 50 questions.

Further, I suggest that https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/voice-commandvoice-command is renamed to plural https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/voice-commandsvoice-commands because that's the usual SE style.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge tag [google-voice-actions] into [voice-command]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5These tags seem more like they just need to be cleaned up to ensure they're being used properly. Some devices have a "Voice Commands" app, but it's *different* from Google's Voice Actions, which is a very specific implementation of voice-driven commands. There are also third-party apps (e.g. [Dragon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nuance.balerion) and such) on the Play Store. I'm not sure I'm convinced they should be merged/synonymized.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I fully agree with eldarerathis: there are far more voice-control apps out there. As they are often called "Voice Assistants": Maybe we we rather introduce a `voice-assistants` tag, and disambiguising `voice-command(s)`?


















I did the following:


Replaced instances of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scannerscanner that were related to document scanning with a less ambiguous https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/document-scannerdocument-scanner tag; created a wiki for this new tag.
Removed https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scannerscanner from 2, 3, and 4 that you noted. Retagged 4 with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hyperlinkshyperlinks
Added a wiki for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/media-scannermedia-scanner to help make clear the distinction between it and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/document-scannerdocument-scanner
Left https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scannerscanner to die off. Arguably we could make it a synonym of the most popular, but the more descriptive tags will appear in the autocomplete for the text "scanner" at this point, so I think it's best to just leave the ambiguous tag alone and see if it comes back.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, eldarerathis -- but by creating the `hyperlinks` tag, you introduced a new issue: we already have an `url` tag, as I pointed out in my question. Shall I open a new Q here, or do you merge/synonymize the two as part of this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy: I don't know. A URL isn't necessarily a hyperlink in all contexts. At a quick glance, I'd be inclined to say that none of the questions in the `url` tag currently would refer to hyperlinks (and FWIW, I didn't create `hyperlinks`, it already existed).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, could be my argument: while a hyperlink may count as URL, a URL not necessarily is a hyperlink :)


















Unless there's an actual app called "RSS Reader" that will be the source of questions, this seems like a reasonable merger to me.

Although, honestly, the question counts are so low we should just edit them. If the tag resurfaces later then let's create a synonym.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, there are a bunch of apps having this in their name. Most of them use an identifying prefix (like "Easy RSS Reader", "Mobo RSS Reader"). Unfortunately there's also one just called "[RSS Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hchina.rssreader)" (took its author a lot of imagination to name it, I guess). I'm not sure if that should count as an excuse, as it's not the most popular one (last updated 07/2012, and 19 votes altogether). I checked all the languages supported by Play, and only found a single comment (French).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then it's unlikely to generate questions here, so we can safely ignore it.


















I just found a question tagged bot, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-mailgoogle-mail (x2) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gmailgmail (x198). Does that really make sense? One could argue the former is for the service, while the latter is for the app. Wrong: Both questions tagged 'google-mail' are about the app (GMail app setup, install google apps).

Thinking about it: All our google apps tags tart with google-* (e.g. google-play-[store|music|books|movies], or google-[maps|talk|voice|calendar|plus|...]. So a tag like google-mail makes absolutely sense to me, and would count as "consolidation". Hence my suggestion:

Merge the two making google-mail the master and gmail a synonym to it. There's not a lot of tag wiki for either of them (just an excerpt on gmail which could easily be cut'n'paste (for Germans: Guttenberg-Schavant ;)).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'gmail' versus 'google-mail'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5TBH, I would have thought the other way would make more sense. Do people actually refer to it as "Google Mail" anymore? The official branding is simply "Gmail", whereas the other ones are all officially "Google [whatever]" (Maps, Play, etc) so their tags follow the actual names. /cc @Flowb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5People can still use the gmail tag. It will just be rewritten to google-mail. Most people I know refer to it as 'Google Mail'. But that may depends on where you live. gmail was a trademark in germany, so google couldn't use it for years.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow: They can still "use" it, sure, but the tag will not display as "gmail". I guess that simply seems counterintuitive to me since the name of the app (and web service) is "Gmail".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you want to match the format of the existing tags, `google-maps`, `google-calendar`, etc. then shouldn't be `google-gmail`?! (Although I wouldn't recommend that.) We had the same issue in the UK... it was officially known as Googlemail for a long time, and I still encounter these email addresses. However, we still used the term gmail in common usage. I'm torn, but I think gmail is a special case.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The name of the product is Gmail.


















Good catch. By popular demand https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-mailgoogle-mail now points to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gmailgmail.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The official name for the app is "[Gmail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm)".


















Keep the wiki excerpt short and focused on what the tag means on this site. For instance, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/emailemail doesn't need to describe what electronic mail is, but rather it should explain that it is for question about email on Android devices in general and the built-in default email app in particular.

Also, don't include an instruction to "see the info link below" to direct the reader to the full tag wiki. While that works on the tag info page, the wiki excerpt is displayed in multiple other places (like the mouseover window) where there is no "info" link for the reader to click.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That last paragraph obviously was addressed to me -- receipt confirmed :) I feel our tag wikis do not get the neccessary attention (admitted, many users don't even read the excerpt -- or nobody would tag a question e.g. 'development'). Would you say "See full wiki for details" would be a better hint -- or shall we ommit it completely?


















The Vote to Close Review queue has been awfully active lately. While there are indeed some crap questions in there that need to be closed, there are some others that make me scratch my head.

Our rule about not allowing app recommendations is to prevent a flood of questions like


  What's a good app to flurb the blag?


and nothing else.

However, I'm seeing an awful lot of questions in the review queue that


have an accepted answer
have a multiple-paragraph, detailed description of the problem the author is looking to solve
are six months old or older


That the question has a throwaway line of "what's an app that can do this?" doesn't immediately disqualify the question. Especially when the vast majority of the time the solution necessarily means an app.

I think we've lost sight of what "no app recommendations" means.

What we don't want:


Questions that are basically polls
Questions that show no research effort and are basically the OP using us as search consultants


These questions that I've been seeing in the review queue are not like this. They're good questions that look like they're getting close votes solely because of the fatal flaw of including a line that says "what's an app that can solve this". 

I have been voting "Leave Open" on these, but as we know there can be a tendency to "dog-pile" votes, and I'm afraid that good (if slightly flawed) questions are being closed for no good reason.

So...


How can we clarify our policy?
Can the Moderators ping the users that are getting a little over-zealous with their Close votes?
Can we have an effort by a few high-rep users (and/or Moderators) to go back over some recently-Closed questions to see if any should be re-opened?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we go easy on the Votes to Close?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53 questions in one... As I'm regularly going over the recently-closed list either, I'll try to keep a better watch on those "worth re-opening" as well. As for the clarifications: We might want to check our FAQ and see if it can be updated in some minor points (e.g. I also miss the "shopping recommendations" explicitly mentioned there). Btw: "Closed" does not mean "deleted" -- one big difference to me when I walk the MRC list (I never vote to delete Qs with appropriate answers, e.g.).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think it's a bad idea that mods (or anybody else) should contact users regarding their votes. Instead the rules about when something is off-topic should get improved. Every user with enough rep is welcomed to view the closed questions for re-open candidates.


















I agree.

The FAQ needs to be revisited. I never understood why "What app can I use to..." was frowned upon. It might be a venue for developers to shamelessly plug their apps, but it's probably also the only way to solve a user's problem.

Having to rephrase the question so that it satisfies the FAQ is a waste of time. 

But I agree that poll-type questions (Which is better for doing this task? App A or App B) should be avoided. 

The same goes for "What's the best app for doing this task?" questions, but I think this is just the same as "What app can I use to..." (minus the "best" keyword). So, we should let that one slide.

It's up to the Answer to provide different alternatives, if they can recommend more than 1 app. But we clearly need to watch out for answers that sound like SPAM, or a recommendation that hardly solves the user's problem.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This seems a bit like throwing the proverbial baby out with the bath water, and I don't think this is really what Al is suggesting. A question like "What app can I use to read email?" (or: "What's the best email app?") is exceptionally lazy and turns into nothing but polling, so I disagree that we should change the FAQ to accommodate such questions. However, a question like "What email app supports [some very specific feature]?" where the OP describes their situation, the reason common apps don't work, etc is technically "What's an app for X?" but has a *lot* of data to box in the answers.


















To avoid confusion, I request we rename the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/transfertransfer (x13) to data-transfer.

Explanation: We already have the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/file-transferfile-transfer (x96). I just went over the questions tagged transfer, and re-tagged a few which rather referred to file-transfer. To avoid people confusing these two tags, IMHO we should do the above mentioned tag-rename.

Optional part: for disambiguity, we could make transfer a synonym to one of the two. Some facts about background for the two tags to be considered in this case: While "file-transfer" clearly refers to "files", obviously, "data-transfer" is less clear a term. Taking a look at the questions tagged such, it refers to...


PIM data such as contacts (x4, plus 1 mixed)
messages: SMS/MMS (x4)
app-data (x2)
other data: links via bluetooth, WiFi APNs (x2)


So we could also think of creating a new https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/contact-transfercontact-transfer tag, which would make sense, and re-tag those 4+1 questions, optionally do the same for message-transfer, and then renaming "transfer" to "data-transfer".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename 'transfer' tag to 'data-transfer'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd personally be okay with simply renaming the tag to `data-transfer` and explaining in the wiki that it's for moving *any* kind of data between devices (contacts, app data, messages, etc) except for flat files. Then we could let that cover anything that isn't a "file transfer".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Once you've done the rename, simply answer this Q and I will setup the tag wiki accordingly. Thanks!


















I already made a similar request about half a year ago (see: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1069/merge-firmware-and-romMerge firmware and rom?). As several other tag/retag/synonym requests, this is still open and unprocessed (i.e. neither rejected nor completed). Maybe the reason is that it's still not clear which way we should go -- but for that it doesn't help to ignore it completely.

Drawing conclusions from the discussion there, let me renew my request for work-to-be-done at that place, but put it in a little different way. We should:


Rename the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/firmwarefirmware tag to 'device-firmware' and (optionally) make 'firmware' a synonym (as we already have https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/radio-firmwareradio-firmware, this would be consequent; here the "radio" tag was simply dropped). Also, as Flow wrote: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/624/how-should-we-handle-the-flash-tagIn the past, if we had an ambiguous tag we specialized the name(s). This step should be performed for sure.
Optionally, again think about merging the whole thing with the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/romrom, as already confirmed by Flow in his comment to the answer there: device-firmware == rom (interpreting SaintWacko's comment following that one: "firmware != rom" as it's not clear what firmware is meant -- which is clear with our reference to "device-firmware" as opposed to "radio-firmware").
if not performing that "optional step 2", we should consider renaming 'rom' to 'stock-rom' (as opposed to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/custom-romcustom-rom), for the same reasons given for #1 (specializing names). Again, 'rom' could be made a synonym or, as in the case of 'radio-firmware', simply be "dropped" (yes, there was a "radio" tag once).

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename the 'firmware' tag to 'device-firmware' and make 'firmware' a synonymb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've done #1. I have not yet done #2 - I'm thinking about it a little bit. Initially, it seems to make sense because of the way people tend to use the word "firmware" to mean "Android system", but I'm not sure if that's necessarily true of every question using the `firmware` tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Trouble with the word "ROM" is its ambigousity. If used, you always have to check the context whether it means the firmware, a part of internal storage (where the firmware sits), or even the radio-firmware and its storage (in admittedly rare occasions). Inheritance of the old "cartridge" times... You probably will also argue on step 3 that 'rom' could be used for questions independent of stock or custom (generic). I agree, and in that case would recommend to "split" the 'rom' tag (creating a 'stock-rom' tag additionally; I'd do the re-tagging and tag-wikis, of course).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We do have [stock-android](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-android), so maybe that serves the purpose of `stock-rom` anyway? Not all questions may necessarily relate to flashing a ROM in that tag, but using it with `rom-flashing` seems reasonable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point! Let me check in how far 'stock-rom' and 'stock-android' differ or match. One could argue the former is about finding images and referring to the system as such (from a technical view), while the latter refers to "stock features" (**Edit:** Exactly that seems to be the case). My, that gets confusing...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Re-thinking the entire mess: @eldarerathis, simply place your first comment as answer (so I can accept) and mark the entire thing as completed. If we want to go for all that 'rom', 'stock-rom', 'stock-android' stuff, we should do so with a separate task/question. Let's leave 'rom' for generic, 'stock|custom-rom' for specific ROM stuff. 'stock-android' might rather relate to `vanilla-android' (again a different task). If you agree (and do as suggested), I would take care for the tag wikis to avoid future confusion.


















Renamed the tag to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-transferdata-transfer to handle anything other than file transfers. Still a broad-ish tag, but should hopefully not get confused with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/file-transferfile-transfer (at least not as much) or other things.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks! Tag-wiki created (just needs to be app-|im-proved :)


















I merged these, but I decided to make https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screencastscreencast the master instead because:


It has been used more often
It is a reasonably common/mainstream term (with a relevant http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScreencastWikipedia page and everything)
As Wikipedia alludes to, the term "screencast" is an analogue to the term "screenshot" (for which we also have a tag: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screenshotsscreenshots)


...but I'd be open to discussion regarding this if it seems illogical.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fine with me. My idea was just to keep it synchronous with other tags we have: 'video-recording', 'voice-recording', 'call-recording'. Now, when looking for [tags containing "record"](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/*record*), 'screen-recording' is *not* turning up. May be a minor thing for most people; only that I use those "wildcard tag searches" quite frequently when cleaning up tags or looking for alternatives. Now it instead sits with 'podcast' and 'webcast', which IMHO are not "that" related :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The `screencast` tag does show up in the tag auto-completion if you type in "recording", though. I actually wonder if synonyms are supposed to appear in tag searches (I would honestly expect that they would). Or it could be a caching thing...I need to experiment with the search a little.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wonder why they get mixed in the "tags" list (with the tags having no numbers, i.e. empty tags), but **not showing up on tag wildcard search via URL. Neither do they show up when using the search box on the [tags page](http://android.stackexchange.com/tags).** Hard to look for "similar tags" this way, if they might be hidden as synonyms -- I'd rather have it the other way round (synonyms not listed on the tags page, but turning up on search/wildcard-url).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm seeing really weird and inconsistent results. Searching for "system-" brings up the `system-clock` tag, for example (which is a synonym of `clock`), but searching for "clock" only shows the master tag. I would have thought that synonyms would be included in searches from the tags page. It seems like the actual tag entry field is the only place that synonyms get searched the way I thought they did.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we file a bug for that (must be MSO, I guess? Never did such a thing). And until solved: switch tag and synonym around (optionally; I don't think it's *that* urgent). // I noticed that discrepancy for a while already, but never took the time to dig into...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to let it sit a little bit and then try it again, to make sure it's not a caching thing. If it's still weird (I really feel like searching for "recording" should show *either* `screen-recording` or the master, `screencast`) then I'll try to form up a feature-request/bug report for MSO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy: I've [written up a post on MSO](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/174044/150283) to see if this can be addressed somehow. The current implementation is, IMHO, broken.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5upvoted and commented -- thanks!


















We have tags for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/video-recordingvideo-recording, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/voice-recordingvoice-recording, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/call-recordingcall-recording, and 'screen-recording' (synonym to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screencastscreencast). I suggest to rename https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/recordingrecording to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/audio-recordingaudio-recording to match that list (I'm already cleaning up the queue, re-tagging Qs belonging to the others) and to avoid ambiguity.

Optionally, 'recording' could become a synonym; but I'd rather say we let it "die hard".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename 'recording' tag to 'audio-recording'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First, is there a meaningful difference between `audio-recording` and `voice-recording`?  The latter could be synonymized under the former.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, there is (at least to me). "voice-recording" to me means "dictaphone" and the like ("lower quality" if you want to say so, and "spoken voice"), usually done via the microphone -- while "audio-recording" rather includes the recording of audio-streams, music (as opposed to "spoken word") etc. and suggests "higher quality". I could go over the tags, check their Qs, re-tag where necessary, and set up fitting tag wikis to make the difference clear :)


















Questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/non-marketnon-market (× 6) are all about https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/side-loadingside-loading (× 17), some even carry this second tag additionally. Hence my proposal:


merge 'non-market' into 'side-loading'
optionally make the former a synonym to the latter, alternatively simply let it die

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'non-market' to 'side-loading'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Where would devices like the Kindle Fire that have an alternate app-store installed (ie not THE Market) fit in here (most Samsung devices also have both the Play Store and a separate Samsung Store app)? They're "non-market", but not "side-loading"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Have you checked whether you can use the non-market markets with "unknown sources" disabled? (I have no such devices, so I cannot check). And as written: all questions tagged non-market are about side-loading. So simply spoken, I could also go and re-tag them, and let the non-market tag die (why didn't I think about that before? ;) -- unless somebody uses it for the reason you mentioned, of course...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn: We do have the [alternative-markets tag](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/alternative-markets) as well. That seems like it may actually be better than "non-market" just because it's a bit more focused. Would that alleviate your concerns?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not to forget the [amazone-appstore](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/amazon-appstore) tag concerning the Kindle.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis fair enough, alternative markets seems good to me. My only remaining concern is more of a nit-pick really. That "non-market" is an adjective describing an app, and side-loading is a verb describing something you'd do with your device. Could there be people who just want to know how to side-load apps on their device, as well as people who are interested in finding other market-places, or are gaining their apps direct from the developer. Are they necessarily going to be asking the same questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If they're looking for "other market-places", 'alternative-markets' would describe this best. If they want apps direct from the developer, they are looking for 'apk'. If they simply want to know how side-loading works, there's 'side-loading'. Do you want to keep 'non-market' as "third source" next to 'google-play-store' and 'alternative-markets'? I can see this would make sense (and we could have the tag-wiki pointing this out).


















We have tags for individual wireless carriers. Some carriers have exclusive devices for their network, and virtually all of them customize Android to add their own software. (Euphemistically known as "bloatware".)

However, it's very rare for a question to be appropriately tagged with a carrier. Almost all of the time the asker is tagging their question to describe their device, not their question.

Further:


There may not be a tag for the asker's specific, carrier-branded device
At least one tag is required, so the asker had to add something
etc.


You can help by looking through the questions with these carrier tags and


removing the tag if the question is not about the carrier in general; remember, https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/272/are-carrier-specific-questions-appropriate-in-aecarrier-specific questions are off-topic here


this is probably also an indication that the question has other tags to describe the device and not the question

If nobody comes up with a good explanation what makes the two tags different, we should merge https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stock-androidstock-android (× 63) with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vanilla-androidvanilla-android (× 28), making the first (and more intuitive for new users) the master, and the second a synonym to it.

Note: Questions about this originate in the comments on https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1410/16575Rename the 'firmware' tag to 'device-firmware' and make 'firmware' a synonym, where eldarerathis and I tried to untangle the mess with 'rom', 'stock-rom', 'device-firmware', and other tags, so one could catch some more background there.

And before somebody asks: yes, I know a stock-rom coming from e.g. Samsung is far from being vanilla. But what are people referring to when tagging a question 'stock-android' or 'vanilla-android'? The "least common denominator". Even questions explicitly tagged vanilla using the term "stock".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'stock-android' and 'vanilla-android'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The previous Stock vs Vanilla discussion was here http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/852/ The consensus then was that they are different things (unless you have a Nexus). "Stock" is what your manufacturer has provided, "Vanilla" is AOSP. Opinions may have changed since then, so it could be worth a discussionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah -- missed that (should have searched for the terms without their suffixes #/). Yepp, as I pointed out I'm aware of the difference (and make that clear in my books as well). But practice shows they are used synonymously by most users. I'm open to both ends -- we should chose what is the best for our site :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Marked as duplicate. If somebody want's to add new arguments or comments feel free to ask to re-open this Q by using a flag.


















I renamed to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/device-firmwaredevice-firmware to make it a little less ambiguous, but didn't do anything with the ROM/custom-rom/etc portions of it at this point. It might be worth a separate discussion of some sort, but I could feasibly see reasons why we would want these separate (e.g. "device firmware" could refer to camera firmware or something, not necessarily the phone itself as the "device").
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you, eldarerathis! But I must disagree with your last sentence: "the device" always is "the device" (i.e. "the Android device"). The camera is but a "component". As we have the 'radio-firmware' tag, we might introduce a 'camera-firmware' tag if needed -- though I never heard anybody flashed such a thing: sure, there is a corresponding entry in some service menus, and a matching "secret code"; but all I read was "keep your fingers off that" :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, as promised I tried to take care for the tag wikis. I hope it didn't get too confusing (especially for `device-firmware`; updates and improvements welcome). And I hope I didn't miss anything...


















https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/recordingrecording should no longer be used; I've retagged the handful of questions that were using it with more specific variants to disambiguate it. It is not a synonym of anything at the moment since the more specific tags will appear in the tag autocomplete anyway.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, somebody seems to have created the 'audio-recording' tag (meanwhile) -- so well, everything fine with me :) Thanks!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That was me. It seemed like it made the most sense, as you suggested.


















I like the suggestion. And it's even better if we have a volunteer. :)

If there are no objections and counter arguments, then the separation should get done.

Next I will check for all those questions we removed the `rooting` tag in the past as they didn't deal with the rooting process as such. *Long way to paradise...*


















As of http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25/conversation/sdcard-taghttp://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25/conversation/sdcard-tag it seems that a generic https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sdcardsdcard is usefull. So we won't merge these two.

Keep `sd-card` as synonym to `external-sdcard` until it gets blacklisted (with `external-sdcard` being the master)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As the `external-sd` tag has a `external-sdcard` synonym for autocompletion of 'sdcard', could we have the same for `internal-sd`?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, so I've been through all the ~400 questions tagged 'sd-card' and sorted them out. 134 are left as being "generic", 16 were specific to 'internal-sd', and 233 went to 'external-sd'. Just for the books :) If anybody is summing it up: right, some were not related to any sd-card whatever, so they've got the tag removed #)


















No: We want to keep https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/non-marketnon-market as "app source" next to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/alternative-marketsalternative-markets, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/amazon-appstoreamazon-appstore, and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-storegoogle-play-store.

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Droid_Incredible_2Wikipedia page for the Incredible 2 simply redirects to the "Incredible S", where it states:


  The HTC Incredible S (S710E), also known as the Incredible 2, is a smartphone [...]


So quite obviously, the devices are identical. Hence my suggestion to merge https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htc-droid-incredible-2htc-droid-incredible-2 (× 9) with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htc-incredible-shtc-incredible-s (× 12), preferably making the latter the master (as it already has a complete tag wiki) and the former, optionally, a synonym.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge "htc-droid-incredible-2" and "htc-incredible-s"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One is CDMA, the other is GSM.  If they are different phones I see no reason to merge them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure? The Wikipedia page reads otherwise: *and it is a world phone able to access **both GSM and CDMA** networks* -- which to me sounds like "it's the same phone, and it can deal with both network types". So either Wikipedia has this wrong, or at least not clear? GSMArena OTOH supports what you wrote ?-/ So if you're sure about that, it seems to be the same as with the *Motorola Droid* vs. *Milestone*...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I generally go with GSMArena, PDADB and Jawal123 show the same.  XDA also has separate forums for them.  [Verizon's docs](http://cache.vzw.com/multimedia/mim/droid_incredible_2/incredible2.pdf) say that the CDMA version has a SIM so presumably it is a world phone like you say ... the question is whether the Incredible S is also a world phone and not purely GSM like the above sites say.  `"incredible s" cdma` isn't returning useful Google results for me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I already accepted your argument (because of GSMArena), and set up the Incredible-2 tag wiki accordingly yesterday. Thanks for clarification, Matthew! I'd say just set this request to 'status-declined' (and the Milestone one as well, maybe), so it/they disappear(s) from the watchlists :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Alright, will do :)


















The XE is a different phone.  Unless there is a compelling reason to do so, I don't think it should be merged.

I have merged the other two tags.

But considering the many different SGS tags, I already thought you might want to keep them separate, though :) Fine with me, at least they *are* different. Thanks for merging the other two :)


















Questions about solving problems with http://tasker.dinglisch.net/Tasker like:


How can I achieve this with Tasker?
Tasker does that instead of this. 
How can I use this Action? etc.


Are these questions considered as out of topic for Android Enthusiasts? 

I am trying to be neutral while asking this question as a end user of Tasker, I sometimes find myself tempting to ask such questions, but also feel this site might look like a Q&A site for tasker, if such questions are supported - really confused between these two.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does questions related to Tasker considered as out of topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think the danger with your first and third questions, is that it sounds like you've already settled on a solution (it's almost an XY problem), but people might want to give you non-Tasker answers. Eg question: "How can I get Tasker to switch on the foobar system when flibble happens?" someone might answer with "Use Flibble Foobar Switcher, it's much simpler and does the job well". Which could well be a correct answer to your problem, just not a correct answer to your question.


















I flagged some comments from a single user as spam/promotional, and the mods have suspended the account (thanks, guys!).

I looked on the https://android.stackexchange.com/users/30163/siuponinguser's page, and I notice it says they are temporarily suspended until April 6 '23.

What, exactly, is the point of a 10 year suspension? I understand the http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/a-day-in-the-penalty-box/penalty box is appropriate, but I feel if it deserves an entire decade, shouldn't the account be deleted instead? In fact, the penalty box as described in the link for suspended accounts states that a suspension is anywhere from 1 day to 1 year.

I'm not arguing the suspension; I'm glad the mods are actively keeping the forums clean. It just seems worthless to keep an account around, hoping that in 10 years the user will have changed his ways.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should accounts be deleted instead of having a suspension for more than 1 year?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ten years seems excessive. Isn't there supposed to be a graduated progression (7 days, 30 days, 1 year)? Seems pointless to suspend for over a year.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett This is their second suspension, but that graduation is just for a "real" user with behavioral problems we hope to correct; a non-contributing spam account doesn't need to be given multiple chances.  I am not sure why the account was not destroyed immediately, since I understand that to be the SE policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Onik is correct about destroyed accounts being recreated with the same credentials. Although we've never done it here, other sites sometimes used a general "spam account" as a merge target for all spammers. [Superuser does this](http://meta.superuser.com/questions/2586/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-deposit-account), for example.


















IMHO: If the account was deleted, nothing would stop the user from recreating it with the exact same details. Suspending it forces the user to create an account with other details, which increases the effort required to create spam accounts.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seems like it would be better if the policy changed, then, with deleted accounts: If an account is deleted, the details used to create the account should not allow a new account. If that isn't possible for technical reasons, then I can understand why an account is "temporarily" suspended indefinitely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@StephenSchrauger Might be something worth bringing up on http://meta.stackexchange.com if it hasn't already been


















I just tapped into the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htc-mytouchhtc-mytouch (× 8) tag today on my walk through our tags. Checking with Wikipedia and GSMArena, I found no such device -- just a "HTC Mytouch 4g". Checking the questions, most of them explicitly name this device -- so I assume it is meant by the tag. Shouldn't we rename the tag then to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/htc-mytouch-4ghtc-mytouch-4g? We already have [htc-mytouch-3g-slide] (× 7) to which it then would correspond, and further avoid confusion amongs our users.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename 'htc-mytouch' to 'htc-mytouch-4g'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think there are 4 variants (3G, 3G Slide, 4G, and 4G Slide) so we may want to be careful.  Might be better to use the alternate names (Espresso, Sapphire, etc.) as the main tags with `mytouch-X` as synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not that familiar with all the US variants (seems like every carrier uses his own brand). I guess the 'htc-mytouch' then was meant to collect everything but the 3g-slide? Makes not much sense to me (unless the slide is merged-in as well). Splitting a tag that rarely used (8Q in ~2y) makes no sense either.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead so how we want to go on from here? a) Merge them all into one 'htc-mytouch' tag, b) split the 'htc-mytouch' into 3 to cover each variant separately, c) leave them as-is?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm inclined to say we don't need to do anything.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm fine with that as well. So count my question as a "note of observation", and feel free to mark it 'status-declined' :)


















This is something of a fringe case. Without divulging too much in the way of "personal" information, I will simply say that the website(s) from the flagged posts were being inappropriately promoted here by multiple parties. I felt this warranted a bit of investigative work, and wanted to (for at least the time being) preserve the account's details.

The reason I chose an arbitrarily large suspension length was because anything else felt...disingenuous, to a point. I had no intention of reinstating the account at any point in the future, but as there is no "permanent" suspension - by definition, basically - I simply typed in a large number to make clear the purpose of the suspension to whomever would be receiving the suspension notice. I certainly did not expect the user to wait with bated breath for the opportunity to return in a decade with the intention of being a well-behaved community member - as you've said, that's quite unrealistic (for a number of reasons).

At this point, you'll find the account has been destroyed for now, though https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1434/981onik's answer is correct in that a destroyed account can simply be re-created. Whether or not this will prove to be problematic remains to be seen, and we'll cross that bridge if we have to.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Today mods can only suspend for 365 days. Only CMs can suspend for longer time. As far I know, they need to manually type in an at most 5-digit number into a textbox. This is the days of the suspension length, the maximum is about 200 years. There is only a single account got such a long ban. In the database, 9999-12-31 is the allowed maximum, but setting it up would require direct prod DB access. I can't remember, how it went in 2013, possibly you've typed in a big number, which was later extended by a CM to a really big one.


















As we discussed, we now have https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-onpower-on and a new synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/battery-lifebattery-life :)

What do you think about the "power-off" synonym and, more important, something like "power-supply" as synonym for 'charging', so auto-completion leads there?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I'm not sure `power-off` is needed, but I don't think it will hurt so I will add it.  Not sure about `power-supply` ... I can see reasonable questions being asked about it that don't necessarily fit in with other classes of `charging` questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So where do you see power-supply questions fitting into? I was at a loss there while re-tagging (luckily the Qs I had were at least related to charging, like "can I use any power supply to charge my X"; but what about one I remember asking for "permanent power supply w/o battery", which definitly is *not* charging-related?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy If there's enough of them, their own tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, if you say so :) I just couldn't find any. But the generic "hardware" tag could do :) So thanx, accepting your answer, done :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I *hate* that tag :P


















I was a Moderator here once upon a time. During my "reign" I protected https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1429/i-need-an-email-client-with-filtering-any-helpthis question due to the number of junk answers it was getting. (Ignore, for now, the fact that we probably wouldn't let such a question stay open nowadays.)

I have since resigned as a Moderator. However, when I view that question, I can see the "unprotect" link. I have not seen that link on any other protected questions, so I can only assume that I can see it because I was the user that originally protected it.

I have not followed through to see if I can actually unprotect it, but it seems to me that displaying that link to me is unintended. (Granted, this is an edge case. I mean, how many protected questions are out there that were protected by former Moderators?)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can see "unprotect" link; should I?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suppose the question is whether never-been-a-mods can unprotect questions they have previously protected.  But the privilege of doing so requires 15k rep, so you still shouldn't be able to do it.  Good catch.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, phooey. I didn't realize that mere mortals could protect questions. (Not paying as much attention on Meta SO as I thought.) This may very well be intended then. I could see someone protecting a question and then having a couple of bounties remove the priv from them, requiring Moderator intervention for their previously protected questions. (Assuming "Protection" is ideally supposed to be a temporary measure.)

Surely our quality standards filter is better than this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How did this question get past the quality filter?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Too bad my suggestion to factor in all-caps [was rejected](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/121301/154510).  But even besides that, starting with `i` and all the others things you mention are (or were) factors.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, there is only one "i". Wouldn't want to trigger on something that trivial.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5http://pics.blameitonthevoices.com/082009/caps_lock_problem.jpg


















How? 

Well, it boils down to this: the current quality filter is designed to catch some really lazy stuff. If you manage to write multiple paragraphs of things that look sorta like words, you're already way ahead. 

On Stack Overflow, I recently raised the threshold questions must pass, and that particular question would've failed... But not because of the caps-heavy body but rather because of the short, no caps or punctuation title and lackluster tagging. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I suggest that having no periods _whatsoever_ (outside of a code block) should be a good indicator of poor quality. I mean, you can't get much lazier than that.


















If you know that in advance, your question should obviously not be asked at all (as the issue is already fixed and recognized as "too localized"). However: if you only find out about that solution later, it's perfectly fine to answer your own question providing the solution (see: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/16930/192154Is it ok to answer your own question and accept it?).

Of course at some point such a question will become "too localized", as (in your example) noone would be using that faulty GMail version anymore a year after. So after providing your answer and accepting it, it might be a good idea to either vote-to-close as "too localized" or flag it such for moderator attention, depending on what your reputation permits you to. This way it might be easier recognized when someone runs a "cleanup batch" later, so it could be deleted (mod) or vote-to-delete'd (10k+ user) when it is outdated.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't know at the time, and both these devices are are 'new' and identical. I also cross checked with someone with a different tablet who has the same 'issue'. This is all very embarrassing, since I'm reasonably familiar with the SE system, and this wouldn't have happened with an OS I was more familiar with. Will self select and flag the question as such.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No problem, as stated above. I would even go so far and say "even if you know in advance", in case you *know* the problem is *wide-spread and affects many users,* and thus might prove valuable (even if for a short time) -- as SE ranks quite high with Google search results. Still, the recommendation with flag/vtc stands :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see no benefit in closing questions if they have a valid answer, that is why I don't see a need to close them as "too localized", even if the issue does not exist any more. Furthermore, while GMail app updates are most likely received by all devices, there are cases where an app update is never delivered to an device (because of vendor/carrier or minimal required Android version restrictions, etc). The information that an app once had a bug that was fixed with an particular update is usually valuable, so I think the best idea is answer your own question and mark it accepted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i would distinguish between issues that are unlikely to and/or shouldn't happen (declining a Gmail update and complaining about bugs) versus things that can't happen (playing an unpatched version of an MMO for example).  Questions about fixed bugs in MMOs should be closed as TL whereas I think it's OK for fixed bugs in apps that you have the option of updating to remain open.  Super User wouldn't close a question about Office 2007 for example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed, there are no "hard lines", and each case needs to be checked on its own -- as Matthew's comment indicates. Also, there's a difference between "close" and "delete": IMHO Flow's "GMail" question should be closed (but *not deleted*); it's still there for reference then, and can be re-opened when it seems fitting. But that's *my* opinion; if my co-Enthusiasts state otherwise, I of course obey :)


















Couldn't a rule be added to the automated quality filter to detect (at least some) development questions?

Any question tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment can safely be rejected (as long as the rejection message doesn't tell the user the tag is what alerted the system, or they'll just remove the tag and resubmit). Similarly, a question that includes Java source code can be flagged by the quality filter. I'm sure a quick analysis of words used in existing closed-OT questions will pull out some obvious words to trigger on when used together, such as "activity" and "class".

Such a filter wouldn't catch everything, but it'd be a big win for a reasonably small outlay (considering there's already a filter for low-quality posts).

It looks like the reason is that there actually https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/150317/is-the-tag-info-page-not-available-on-phone-versionisn't a mobile optimised version of the tag wiki pages.

There are a couple of feature request posts asking for this to be improved/made available, I think the best thing would be to go and post on and vote for those questions:


https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101113/View tag wiki excerpt on tag page on mobile site
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/161668/Can we get a “learn more…” link to tag wikis on the mobile site?

Looks like there's a little glitch in our tags:



IMHO there should be either a tag or a synonym named "reset", but never both. The screenshot is from the "edit tags" dialog. If I select  the left red-box, it adds "factory-reset" (as expected). Selecting the right one in fact adds "reset". Calling https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resethttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reset gets redirected to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/factory-resethttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/factory-reset.

Could this be left-overs from some incomplete merge? How to get it cleaned up?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag mismatch (or rather "technical glitch")b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not a bug - this behavior is intended to give folks a chance to review synonyms before an (irreversible) merge is performed. Moderators can merge once this is done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Didn't know that non-moderators could merge synonyms as well -- looks like I've missed an option somewhere? If anyone other than mods, certainly a 20k+ (me) should then be able to?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not merge, but create: http://android.stackexchange.com/privileges/suggest-tag-synonymsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, now I've got it -- thanks, that Penny took a while to sink #D


















Yes, this does appear to have been a case where two tags were synonymized but not merged, thereby leaving behind https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/resetreset on the questions that had it at the time the synonym was created.

I've retagged all such questions, so it should no longer appear in the list as anything other than a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/factory-resetfactory-reset.

Every question page has a list of related questions on the left. A few months ago, a change was rolled out on all SE sites to add a score indicator to each question in the list. On some other sites, this indicator also shows whether the question has an accepted answer.

The example below is from ux.SE. The first and third related questions do not have an accepted answer, but the second one does.



I find the answered/unanswered indication to be more useful than the question score. When looking for answers, it gives you a hint as to which related questions are likely to have the answer you're looking for. When answering questions, it gives you a hint as to which related questions might benefit from an answer you can give, or which are useful targets for "try the answers here and come back if you're still stuck" links.

Can we have this indicator too, like other SE sites?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can ASE have the answered/unanswered indicator in Related Questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's a subtle differentiator, I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't pointed it out! And how dare ux.se have a better user experience than us!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that it would be useful for this site (and ux.se, if they emphasized it more; it is very unremarkable visually).

I think you are correct in saying that the Android update questions are not really a good fit for this site.  They are excepted because of how broadly useful they are; we did, and still do, get hundreds of questions asking when Device X will get an android update.

Yes, very probably.

See #2

No, there's no SE site where you could ask this.  Do see https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/371/1465Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?

I agree, the site title does not necessarily give a good idea about how the Stack Exchange platform works and the kind of questions we accept.  You should read it as an SE site for Android enthusiasts, rather than as a general website for them.
Your rephrased question is the same question.  Just because questions without problems behind them are not normally accepted doesn't mean all questions with problems behind them will be accepted.  The problem is, as noted, that it's a list question.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the thorough answer.  It's really sad that the scope of Android Enthusiasts is so small, because many questions I've seen which had great answers were closed as not constructive, and I would like to think those and other questions would have had even more great answers or could have received helpful answers including newer information.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One other side question...regarding #5, would it be appropriate then to ask, "What is a phone that supports ambient temperature sensor readings?" and hope for more than 1 phone (if more than 1 even exists)?  I didn't phrase it that way because I saw another question here where people were discouraged from posting one feature or one phone per answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@rob Yeah, that also wouldn't work -- any device with such sensors would be a valid answer, which essentially leaves no way to distinguish answers.  You'd end up with a list, just broken up into separate answers, and voting would turn into a bizarre popularity contest instead of being quality-based.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also agree/confirm we have several closed questions with great answers -- but I don't see a problem with that, for two reasons: 1) these answers are still available (the question is closed, but not deleted -- and we take care to differentiate between the two), and 2) I could imagine even more great answers on several topics, which still wouldn't make them (including their respective questions) on-topic on ASE :) So the link Matthew gave you: [Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/371/16757), is my recommendation, too :)


















I keep running across a ton of questions that have been closed as being not within the scope of the site, and it seems like the usefulness of this site is really being hindered by its limited scope and, to some extent, the mods themselves (no disrespect intended).  Here are some problems I've noticed just in the past day or two:


The FAQ explains that the scope is effectively just a tech support site for people having problems with their phones, which by definition means the information will become less useful and will go stale as new phones, apps, and OS versions are released.
Questions that have broadly useful information are closed so the information ends up going stale and, in some cases, becomes incorrect over time and cannot be corrected by anyone.
New questions asking for updated information that is not included in the stale answers are marked as duplicates of the old answers with little (or, in the case of a closed question, zero) hope of getting a correct answer.
In the most extreme case, I even found a community wiki answer that the mods changed to an individual answer after closing the question as "not constructive" despite being something that any true "Android Enthusiast" would actually want to know. So now nobody can edit the answer, nobody can add an updated answer, and nobody can ask the same question without getting it closed as a duplicate. Example: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/29204/which-hardware-sensors-are-supported-by-androidWhich hardware sensors are supported by Android?, 507 views in 9 months


In https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/201/more-discussion-on-the-scope-of-android-seMore Discussion on the Scope of Android.SE, it is mentioned that the site is not for programming questions, but sometimes there are lower-level or more technical questions which are useful to programmers but not at all suitable for Stack Overflow or any other SE site.  To me, this is the type of information an enthusiast would want.  Why wouldn't one want these to be included on the "Android Enthusiasts" site?  It seems misleading for android.stackexchange.com to be so limited in its scope.

Or, to put it another way...

In any other discipline (automotive, electronics, underwater basket weaving, etc.), an "enthusiast" is defined as someone who mods, tinkers with, completely understands the internals and mechanics of the subject matter, and who pushes the machinery and materials to their limits and beyond--in fewer words, an expert in the field.  But it seems like Android Enthusiasts is much more watered-down, to the point that its only target demographic is Jane or Joe User who is having a problem with his or her phone, and the site perhaps would be more aptly named Android Owners or Android Tech Support.  Although I certainly can appreciate the need for that type of content, it seems like the current scope as outlined in the FAQ and enforced by the mods unnecessarily creates a need for yet another Android site that specifically caters to enthusiasts as the term is applied to other disciplines.  I would think you'd want as many of these people as possible to use and promote the site, but instead you're basically telling the most excited Android experts and evangelists to go back to xda-developers and other forum-based sites which are very poorly-suited for Q&A-style discussions.

The Question

Most other Stack Exchange sites aim to be the singular canonical reference on their domain, crushing most other sites that previously were the better-known resources.  But it seems Android Enthusiasts considers everything  but specific technical support questions to be off-topic (except in a few cases, where questions normally considered inappropriate for the site are allowed simply because people would otherwise keep re-asking those same questions hundreds of times).  Why is the scope of Android Enthusiasts so severely limited?  Is it simply because there aren't enough mods, or is it something deeper?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is the scope of Android Enthusiasts so small?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Closed questions (and answers on closed questions) can be edited, and anyone on the site can suggest an edit, so you may wish to revisit many of the points you're presenting here (i.e. #2 and #4 are seem incorrect, you could edit an old answer or leave a comment if it needed to be updated).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis my general observation on most stack exchange sites is that people don't edit other people's closed questions or their answers because there's not really any incentive to do so. There is a very contrived method by which you can hope to add an answer, but it's inconvenient and non-obvious. It is also NOT true that anyone can suggest an edit, at least via the "edit" function--for example, the button is disabled for me on questions and answers that I did not write. In any case, thanks for the very thoughtful answer you posted below.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You should be able to suggest an edit to any question or answer provided that the post is not locked (a different status than closed). That's the way [it's documented on MSO](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76251/how-do-suggested-edits-work) at least, so I'm unsure why you would be seeing that behavior.


















I'm not sure that there's an authoritative way to answer this aside from "because that's how it was originally defined" back when it was proposed on Area 51. The SE 2.0 sites operate with a pretty good amount of autonomy, so the process was:


A user on Area 51 wrote a site proposal and definition
Other users committed to that proposal to help launch the site
The current users maintain the site


I haven't really seen the scope change much since the original definition, really, at least not in any particularly significant ways. If you want to trace down the "why" of the current scope, then you'd have to go back to the start, I suppose.

Beyond that, I think your concerns might benefit a bit from some concrete examples of things that you think are currently considered unsuitable for this site, but should be. While a large portion of the scope is tech support type things (i.e. "using your Android device"), we also do handle more technical things that I would consider "enthusiast" questions and not layman concerns. Some selections to serve as illustrative examples:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/28481/how-do-you-extract-an-apps-data-from-a-full-backup-made-through-adb-backupHow do you extract an App's data from a full backup made through "adb backup"?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6435/sd-card-partitioning-why-howSD card partitioning? why? how?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/17482/how-can-i-install-vanilla-android-on-the-kindle-fireHow can I install vanilla Android on the Kindle Fire?
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5884/is-there-a-way-for-me-to-run-adb-shell-as-root-without-typing-in-suIs there a way for me to run Adb shell as root without typing in 'su'?


All of these generally involve things I would consider tweaking or modding outside the normal bounds of the device (and outside the purview of Joe Android Owner). These are perfectly valid questions for our site, and there are others in the same vein as well.

It is true that we generally avoid broad questions, but that's as much a product of the framework we operate in as it is a product of the site's specifically defined scope. Stack Exchange sites are great for getting a definitive answer to a concrete question. They are very poor for aggregating large quantities of information, shopping for suggestions, or other opinionated/discussion-y type queries. Every site in the network balks to some degree at questions that are too broad; each site has some flexibility to decide where they want to draw the line, but most have settled on fairly narrow interpretations because it's what the communities (by and large) feel works best. It just isn't what we strive to be. 

We aren't everything for everybody, but then, that's not what we're trying to be anyway, and it's not what the Stack Exchange model was predicated on. Would "Android Owners" or "Android Users" be more appropriate names for the site? Maybe. I don't know, really, because we do cover topics that I would say are only relevant to enthusiasts. Then again, maybe you and I have different ideas about what makes someone an "enthusiast", and maybe someone else has yet a third opinion. None of this is particularly cut-and-dry.

Maybe there's room for us to widen our scope a bit. Maybe there isn't. Either way, it's not something that will happen overnight. We'll have to hash it out here on Meta and see where the chips fall, because it's a dialogue that would have to include everyone involved on the site. However, even if we stick to the current scope, I think we're still serving a good niche. There really isn't anywhere else on the internet where you can imply ask a "How do I do X with my Android device?" question and get a direct, no-nonsense answer. XDA and other forums are great resources - don't get me wrong - but there is just much more noise in forum environments, whereas we can keep the signal very high. It's not always a perfect system, but in my opinion, it works better than a lot of alternatives.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the thorough and thoughtful answer.  The examples you gave are more technically-oriented than the other questions I've seen, but it does still seem like there's a lot of room for expanding the scope.  I've found it difficult to find information on XDA and other forum-based sites because there are several threads about the same thing and as you mentioned there's a lot of noise to sort through in the threads.


















The answer to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/46375/keyboard-settings-on-emulator-revert-on-restartthis question which was automatically turned into a community-wiki post not long ago is now, once again a non-wiki post! I checked the 'activity' section of my user profile page. There is no account for this change there either!

This raises a curious question: On what basis is a community-wiki post turned (automatically or not) into a non-wiki post?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Wiki post turns non-wiki!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This would be a new change. I know there has been some discussion on auto-CW, but I haven't (yet) seen where they've made a change.


















This was my doing. I saw your (deleted) meta question about why your answer was a CW. I didn't  think it deserved to be a CW answer, so I reverted it back to a normal answer. Any further edits should not make it CW again unless a mod reverses it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why didn't this reversal show in the post edits?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett No idea, I just mod -> remove wiki. Doesn't seem to leave a mark on the answer's history that this was done. Might be a good suggestion for meta.SO.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is actually a history entry for this action, @Al... But for some reason it's not visible to most users (not even to moderators). There are a handful of such history types, mostly falling into the category of "things we might need if a moderator is abusing their power but which aren't generally interesting" - I'm not so sure "removed wiki" falls into this bucket, but that's where it currently sits. FWIW, moderators are generally happy to remove CW status when there's only one author and no evidence of abuse.


















My answer https://android.stackexchange.com/a/46215/23562here got put into community wiki status automatically because I edited it lots (I was also the only editor). 

From my understanding, once an answer becomes a community wiki, the original answerer no longer receives rep from upvotes to the answer, but I am still receiving reputation on upvotes to that answer since it went to wiki (It went to wiki on June 11, 22:13Z, but I got an upvote rep from it on June 18, 18:19Z).

Does that not apply to answers that received wiki status via mass-editing when all the editing was done by the original answerer or is this a bug?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should Community wiki answers converted via editing still be granting rep to the original answerer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Huh.  I heard some rumblings about this changing but I thought the CW status would not be applied if you were still to receive rep.  It's a good answer, so I upvoted it now, and your rep hasn't changed.  I'm not sure I would reverse the CW-ization though since many of the edits were minor ... we don't want it continually bumped to the first page for that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead maybe I don't understand the point of CW, but shouldn't things only go to CW if multiple people edit it? the 10 edit rule seems arbitrary, especially if someone keeps updating their answer in a short period of time (in this case, 24-48 hours). Maybe 10 edits over a longer period of time or multiple people would make sense to me... but I don't know what the StackExchange view is on this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BryanDenny Even the folks at SE don't understand CW and never have :P.  It's in a really weird limbo right now.  I've previously expanded on my take over at Music: [http://meta.music.stackexchange.com/a/14/28](http://meta.music.stackexchange.com/a/14/28)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The reason posts go CW after 10 edits from the author is to help prevent authors from continually bumping their post to the front page.


















Case in point, this recent question https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/47582/published-android-app-on-playstore-and-my-email-is-now-disclosed-to-scrappershttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/47582/published-android-app-on-playstore-and-my-email-is-now-disclosed-to-scrappers

This question was closed by eldarerathis, in accordance to ASE's scope as defined in the faq, however I don't believe it should. The primary reason we avoid Android development question is because it overlaps with SO, and SO are better equipped to handle such questions than ASE, but this question would not be on-topic on SO.

Simply put, I'm putting into question whether or not we should keep this in the FAQ:


Issues with the Android Market from the point of view of a developer or publisher

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should Google Play Store questions be on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It is of my opinion that our site's scope should include not just Android as an OS but also the ecosystem around it as it relates to Android. I believe that just because a question is only of interest to developers shouldn't automatically make the question off topic, after all developers are often power users as well and they roam this site as well; I believe that many non programming questions about using Android or its ecosystem that are only of interest to people doing development should still be on topic here. Thoughts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Anyone interested in such questions may also be interested in [the proposed SE site for app stores](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/54103/app-stores?referrer=Ccx_OvEDTEtjuiuCuAdO9A2). Up to now, ASE doesn't even appear in the proposal's "users are also active in" list.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm featuring this because I think it's a good discussion for us to have. Both sides have pretty reasonable arguments, so hopefully people will see it in the Community Bulletin and present their thoughts here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dan Hulme: AskDifferent does appear there though, one might wonder if it's because ASE had been a *bit* too hostile to non programming, developer questions? ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A commenter with the opposite prejudice might say that ASE is *more successful* at keeping a tight user focus.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But in reality I don't believe that AD's policy on developer questions is materially different. Another factor is that *all* iOS and Mac developers are Mac users, because the development tools run on Mac, whereas you can develop for Android without being an Android user day-to-day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is also the [Android Internals](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56636/android-internals) which IMHO would be ideal for questions about the play store from a developer's perspective (if the app stores SX proposal failes).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dan Hulme: even Arqade.SE beats ASE on interest for the App Store proposal, and there's not yet any indication so far that it would include game stores (e.g. Steam, Desura, etc). On the other hand, GameDev.SE is nowhere to be seen there. Would that mean that Arqade is poor at keeping a tight focus?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LieRyan No, of course I don't believe that, no more than I believe it's because Arqade is less hostile developer questions than ASE is. You're the one who suggested that ASE's absence was a reflection of this policy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme: I hope you hadn't missed the wink smiley when I make that assertion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis: Thanks for adding the featured tag. Ultimately, I do wish that being friendlier to non programming, developer questions might make ASE more interesting to developers because many end-user questions can really benefit from a perspective about android internals.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can you supply some samples of otherwise good questions that we closed because of this policy? (The one example you give is, in my opinion, not a very good question.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett: This is the kind of hostility I'm referring to: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/47626/grossing-ranks-increase-while-revenue-and-in-app-purchase-are-decreasing-any-ot. The OP on that question made the mistake of asking the question from the point of view of developer even when the developer aspect is not really relevant, prompting swift close votes. While the question as is are too localized, instead of getting closed it would probably be better rewritten into: "How is top grossing ranking calculated in Play?", which certainly would be of interest to users as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see any hostility there. I also don't understand what's being asked. That's not a cogent question. Closing was the right thing to do. If you think it could be rewritten to be more appropriate, go for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett: I've edited that question, and VtR. Perhaps hostility isn't the right word, but my point is that I seemed to notice (unscientifically of course) that questions that mentions being an developer tends to attract vote close more readily than those that don't, even after discounting the obvious off topic SO questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's exactly the same issue as problem-solving questions being closed as app recommendations just because the author included the sentence "Is there an app that can do this?" at the end.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another example of developer questions that I think should not be off topic: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/48135/app-not-searchable-in-play-store-10-days-after-being-published


















Topics related to users using the Play Store and problems using the Play Store are already on topic, there's lots of them in the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-storegoogle-play-store tag.

It's just questions from a developer's perspective that are off-topic, and I think that's still the right distinction.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for clarifying the rule. As the discussion is about *changing* the rule, would you care to expand on why you think it's optimal as it stands?


















https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1484/440I agree with GAThrawn, that the rule is simply "if it's asked from a developer's perspective then the question is off-topic on Android Enthusiasts." 

I like to add that it is not always easy to say which questions are clearly developer questions and which are power end-users ones. I'd like to see more tolerance for the later ones. But the mentioned question from OP is simply off-topic according the above rule.

On a side note: Maybe it would be a good idea to fill the gap between Android Enthusiasts (end-users) and stackoverflow (developers). ATM the gap is filled by external sites like XDA. But I really like the idea of a SX site for non Android API programming and Android internals questions, something like the proposed http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56636/android-internalsAndroid Internals.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do definitely agree with your second point. I actually think the current FAQ/Help Center page may benefit from a slight rewording, to something like "Questions about Google Play that are *primarily of a concern to developers or app publishers*". There have been cases where questions from a dev POV were also appropriate to users if they were simply reworded very slightly, generally because they were a bit of an XY problem (or just had a lot of overlap with a user concern and the dev part was not actually relevant).


















As I see it, the key issue is about allowing users to identify themselves. When I went to see Mr. Spolsky speak about SE, the first and biggest point he made is that when someone visits the front page of an SE site, they can immediately see whether the site is for them. They look at the questions, and they think, "Yes, these are the kind of questions I am interested in," or alternatively, "I have no idea what these people are talking about." Obviously, this isn't to be taken too narrowly: nobody suggests that questions about phones put off tablet users.

Looking at it that way, the debate over non-programming questions that only a developer would ask (which includes publishing questions) has these pros and cons:-

Arguments for allowing

It would attract developers (most of whom are also users) to the site. They would be useful for answering some of the harder user questions as well. Some of the users interested in such questions are already ASE users, so the change would make the site more useful to existing users.

Occasionally, even developer-oriented questions are useful to end users. Sometimes it satisfies one's curiosity to see what happens "behind the scenes". Better understanding the relationship between app publishers and Google can help advanced users to understand quirks in the way apps interact and why they're written in particular ways. We try to spot such questions and see their usefulness from a user point-of-view, but I wouldn't claim that we're 100% successful: I'm sure there are closed questions that could be useful but were phrased in the wrong way. In addition, there may be many more that simply aren't asked because of the policy. Allowing developer-oriented questions may well improve the site for non-programmers too.

Arguments for disallowing (i.e. keeping the status quo)

Visitors who aren't developers would see the questions written from a developer's perspective, be unable to identify with them, and thus feel less like the site is for them. How likely this is would depend on how many such questions we get, but don't forget that a feedback mechanism is at work: the more non-programming developer questions we get, the larger a fraction of the site will be developers, so the more non-programming developer questions we'll get, &c.

There's a smaller risk that showing ASE as a place where developer questions and user questions meet will increase the number of other off-topic developer questions, such as polling for user suggestions, spam advertising apps, and localized questions that only Google support can answer ("can I upload app x").

Balancing the arguments

So which side you're on really depends on how you weigh the risk of driving away users against the chance of attracting new users and becoming more useful to existing users; and the burden of new kinds of bad questions against the proportion of questions that turn out to be good for non-programmers.

To weigh these up, you also have to consider that there are a lot more non-programmer Android users to drive away than there are Android programmers to attract; OTOH, the programmers are more likely to already be SE users, so they're more likely to find ASE in the first place.

Whatever we decide here, I think these arguments apply almost verbatim to other kinds of non-programming developer questions. It might be worth thinking of the publishing questions as a "pilot" for allowing other kinds in future.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`localized questions that only Google support can answer` - This is personally one concern I think would require some serious consideration w.r.t publishing questions. I worry that many (perhaps even a vast majority) will simply be unanswerable by anyone other than Google or a payment processor or the like. Especially given the ones we've generally seen thus far.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We've already had the odd question like that, too. The questions on the App Stores proposal haven't shown this problem, but that's probably down to the different make-up of users on A51.


















From what I've seen of questions asked by developers having issue with the Play Store, most of the questions would be closed in any event, simply because


it was very specific to the person asking it,
it was soliciting opinion,
it was something only Google could answer, or
it was rhetorical/a rant.


(I'll see if I can dig up some examples, but it'll take time.)

Further, would any of these questions have people who could answer them? We only have a few developers here; I expect most questions will remain neglected and unanswered.

Granted, this last is a chicken-and-egg problem, but would developers come here and happily co-exist with Android users? 

And what about the slippery-slope issue of, "Well, you let me ask about Play Store Analytics for my app. Why won't you let me ask coding questions? All the developers are here anyway..."

I think, were we to change our policy, we'd end up with something like what we have with rooting/modding questions. Yes, we have a bunch, and some have good answers, but the really good information is elsewhere, and we're mostly just a gateway to that information. Only worse.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was looking through some of the deleted questions for representative examples of what we've seen so far, too. For your first point: http://android.stackexchange.com/q/45783/981, for your second: http://android.stackexchange.com/q/44230/981, and for your third: http://android.stackexchange.com/q/46176/981 (all of these require 10k to see, of course). There are many more in the same veins as these three, and I would consider all to be poor fits for our site, even if we did change the policy.


















The new https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasonsrework of the close vote system has rolled out network-wide, which brings with it a handful of changes. One of these is that we can now define up to three sub-reasons and modify the default close reason to select from when choosing to close a question. We currently have the following choices:

Default Close Reason


  This question does not appear to be about $Topic, within the scope
  defined in the [help].


Custom Close Reasons

1.)


  Questions about software development are off-topic here, but can
  be asked on https://stackoverflow.com/aboutStack Overflow.


2.)


  Questions seeking application recommendations are off-topic as they become obsolete quickly. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/Instead, describe your situation and
  the specific problem you're trying to
  solve.


3.)


  (empty)


This leaves us with the ability to add one more and/or replace (or simply eliminate) the current two, also we can change the default close reason. So if you have suggestions, please post add them as answers here.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should our new off-topic close reasons be?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It would be helpful if someone went through the last bunch of closed questions and looked for patterns. I don't have time to do it right now, but if no one else gets to it I'll work on it (perhaps later today).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett: Right now the general trends I'm seeing are (in general order of quantity) - 1) Dev or publishing questions 2) App recs (+1 phone buying advice question) that are too broad 3) "Where can I find a website with X information about Android?" (or just "Where can I find stats/info about X?") and 4) Things with no evident/immediate connection to Android.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Right now if you flag a question, the OT reasons are (1) app recommendation; (2) should be on meta. There's no default as described above, no development reason, and you have to give one of those two reasons to flag as OT. Did someone press the wrong button?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme: The system is still a little bit rough around the edges in some regards. The 3 custom reasons evidently cannot be *edited*, so if you want to change one you have to remove it and then add a new one. Adding the new one requires a mod to write it, then a *second* mod to approve it, so the dev/publishing/etc reason got held up waiting for approval from a second moderator. It should be live now; if you still can't see it, please ping one of us so we can take a look at it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We still get the occasional device shopping question. Shouldn't we instead call out "**application or device recommendations**"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett: Yeah, I agree. I was trying to roll that into [this suggestion](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/1491/981). What do you think of that wording? I can suggest an update to the current one but a second mod will need to approve it before it goes live.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I like that suggestion better.


















I think it might be beneficial to make the wording of the first one more broadly applicable than just "software development questions". Something like:


  Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questionsother resources that may be appropriate for your question.


The reason I'm inclined to link to https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questionsWhere can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions? instead of SO directly is that there are things in that statement (publishing and such) that SO would likely close as well.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5s/of a concern/of concern/b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree. The format I chose for the pro-forma comment is "Questions about *writing and publishing* Android apps", which says much the same thing in fewer words. I might suggest making it "apps or ROMs" to include that kind of development question too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme: Tweaked a little. Writing custom ROMs does seem like a good thing to include since we've got the space. Additional thoughts?


















Adding onto the second one to cover other recommendation type questions seems beneficial, in my opinion. I would suggest wording along the lines of:


  Questions seeking app recommendations, device recommendations, or other purchasing advice are off-topic as they become obsolete quickly. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/Instead, describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I find "shopping advice" vague. This is referring to device and accessory recommendations, right? Could we do something like "Questions seeking application, device, or accessory advice"? (assuming we're an Oxford comma kind of place...)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mr.Buster Yeah, the intent was to try to capture both app recommendations and device/accessory/etc purchasing advice. The other category of questions that I was kind of aiming for are things that might have in the past been closed as "Too localized", since we lack that close reason now; mostly questions along the lines of "Where can I buy (some phone)?" I would consider that "shopping advice", but it is a little vague. I'm having trouble coming up with good phrasing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just had the thought that it may be a good idea to also add a pointer to our chat. Something like: "Our chat is the ideal place to talk with other Android Enthusiasts about device and app recommendations." What do you think?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow: I wouldn't be opposed to that.


















I don't think app recommendations should be a separate close reason. We turn away app recommendations for two reasons:


They're usually opinion-based and subjective.
There are usually many apps, any of which might be the best answer for the OP. We end up with one or two recommendations per answer, with no definitive answer.


If the question falls under 1, then we have the new "opinion-based" close reason to deal with it. If it falls under 2, then we have the new reason "too broad". If the question isn't opinion-based, and doesn't need a list, then why are we closing it?

IMO we already have a problem with people flagging or VTCing questions that describe the problem the questioner wants solved and then end with, "Is there an app that can do that?" Adding an "app recommendation" close reason will, I think, encourage the knee-jerk reaction. I'd rather see flaggers and VTCers (and commenters) think about what's actually wrong with a question before hitting the button.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is true, we could probably just use the "primarily opinion based" close reason for app recommendations. That would potentially free up a spot for something like a "legal questions" close reason. Do you think there would be anything in particular that would be worth adding in place of the current app rec one?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I agree with this, in my experience it's always cleaner and users respond better when you can just say "this is something we've decided is not part of our scope".  Otherwise you will get people arguing that it's relevant despite its subjectivity, or that other subjective question X was allowed (so why not mine?).  Unless there's something compelling that we can't fit in due to the inclusion of this reason, I would prefer to keep it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with Dan, but Matthew makes a good point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And, for what it's worth, [webapps.se] (the other site I'm active on) also has "app recommendation" as one of the off-topic reasons.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks @AlEverett, it's good to have another perspective. Do they also have questions that look like shopping questions but aren't really?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dan: Not as much as we do here. Usually the asker has a single web app in mind.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme: Good call on trying to minimize the "knee-jerk" VTCs. I prefer having the close reason be more specific, though, and think that having "app recommendations" as its own close reason is more valuable available than not.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also think that we should have an explicit 'recommendations' close reason at first. If we ever need the slot we can remove it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Plus another advantage of having an explicit close reason is that we can put links (like [this one](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/)) into the reason. This is not possible with the "primarily opinion-based" one.


















My suggestion


  Questions on Android Enthusiasts should be asked from a end-user point
  of view and within the scope defined in the [help].


Not sure if my english is good enough to sound natural. @Native speakers: Feel free to edit and improve. @All: Your comments are welcome :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"with relevance for end-users" sounds off to me, can't think of a better rewording. I get your meaning (our scope is for end-users/power users/super users), but I think it could be more concise.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe "This does not appear to be a question that would be relevant to using Android, and is therefore not within the scope defined in the [help center](http://android.stackexchange.com/help)" or something along those lines?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@BryanDenny eldarathis what do you native tongues think of this wording?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FLow yeah that's better


















First, we apologize for the embarrassingly long time that it took for an official reply to this. We do, in fact, make a point of reviewing feature requests on all sites weekly and escalating ones that we think are good ideas and easily implemented to the developers. Please don't think your request fell on deaf ears.

While this looks like it would be something that would be relatively easily done, it's actually not.The site specific text in the sidebar does come from the database, but only the 'Android' part.

To implement this, we'd either have to make just your page different from the rest of the network (not good), or there would have to be an additional site setting and content area which would mean rolling out a change to every site on the network.

I did look at your closed and deleted questions when I discussed this with the rest of the team and you do get your fair share of off topic programming questions. However, we really doubt that the additional text would slow them down. The thing is, frankly, when people ask a question prior to even looking around, they generally don't read beyond what they must in order to ask.

If it were clear that this would put a major dent in the noise, we'd probably consider it more, we understand how annoying noise like that can be. We just don't think this would make enough of a difference to warrant the work it would take.

One thing I certainly miss from time to time is the possibility to directly contact an ASE co-member. Especially when new users are involved which at the same time are also beginners concerning Android, communication gets difficult. What do we have for those cases?


Comments: they often have a lot of ping-pong in these cases, as the OP has difficulties getting the point and providing the required details, or gets lost in the process. So it usually doesn't take that long until the message appears to continue this in...
Chat: Pretty good place to go into details, absolve the "ping-pong-process" to obtain necessary information and walk through the steps of possible solutions. Trouble is: when it's needed most, its not available -- as new users lack the required reputation.


So we either have extended discussions in comments, or... nothing in some cases. This is quite frustrating for both sides.

What could be done?

This might be one point why people leave their mail addresses (though in most cases, I'd say its not -- but rather "I am no frequent user, and get no information by mail when comments/answers pop up. As I'm too lazy to check, please mail me"). If the essence of the correspondation is brought back to the post, that's fine -- but I doubt they will take the time, once the issue is settled.

I'd rather wish for a lower limit to chat, limited to such cases. A possible feature would be: Higher-rep user can "invite" even new users to a private/separate chat room, where the issue could be settled (others could of course join-in this discussion, given the required reputation or invitation). With this feature, leaving a mail address would lack its purpose (and could even be exchanged in chat then), and I'd vote to "edit it out".

Just asked

and got the comment by @Izzy that it is OT.

On the other hand, a related question,

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/6290/how-can-i-view-a-pdf-in-2-up?rq=1How can I view a PDF in 2-up?

was migrated to AE.  Is it my precise wording that is wrong? Should I have rephrased it as "I have problems with my preinstalled viewer, viewing two-column documents, what shall I do?".

The migrated question here seems fine, though, although I thought we already had a question covering it :)


















I have Request Policy on Firefox, which blocks external files from a website unless it has been whitelisted. Randomly today, I noticed it was blocking a https://android.stackexchange.com/users/36991/mostafa-laftauser's profile image. Apparently, this person has their image hosted on Facebook.

How exactly does someone link to an external site for their photo? When I go to change my image, I only get the option to upload a photo (which itself is a relatively new feature) or use Gravatar.

Is it Gravatar that is linking to the image externally? I haven't used the Gravatar image ever since uploading my own, so I don't remember how it sotred/linked images.

Or is the "upload photo from web" option actually just linking instead of copying to the StackExchange network?

This is presumably going to become more relevant, and have a bigger backlog over time as things change, but what's prompted this thought right now is http://googlereader.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/a-final-farewell.htmlGoogle's recent closure and total shut-down of Google Reader.

Now that there is absolutely no way to use either the Google Reader website, the Android Google Reader app, or the Google Reader API an awful lot of the questions in https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-readergoogle-reader just aren't relevant or useful any more. While some of them are really more generic RSS related questions that happen to have the Google Reader tag, many of the others are very specific question about the app or service. While I don't think that these necessarily need deleting (there are answers on there that were previously good and useful, and they don't deserve to lose the associated rep just because things have changed), there's also no reason to leave the question open when it's never going to receive another good answer.

Previously these would have been a good candidate to "Vote-To-Close" as "https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1254/what-makes-a-question-too-localizedToo Localized" (in time) but https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1489/what-should-our-new-off-topic-close-reasons-bethere is no "Too Localized" reason any more. What should we do with these types of questions?

Edit: should probably also point out that Google Reader is just a topical example. In the future this could also apply to many other commonly used services that rely on a backend provided by a single company, eg Facebook, GMail, Twitter, Skydrive, Flickr, Dropbox and so on.

I fully agree with the question. And checking our closure reasons, there's nothing that matches this case. As I already mentioned in chat: Maybe we should propose an appropriate closure reason on Meta SE; I was thinking about something like "NLR" (no-longer-relevant), as matching the "too localized (in time)" (this term also would avoid the confusion we had in the past about what "too localized" means).

I further agree they should be closed, but not deleted (as already described in the question). Not only for the rep, but also for reference. Though specific to Google Reader, parts of those answers might prove useful in other context as well.

And I like the idea of a specialized close reason. But I don't think that we should close the questions until there is such a reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Positive rep will be kept for posts >3 months old at the time of deletion, I believe.

As you say, there's no particular reason to leave these questions open. At the same time, there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to close them either.

The risks/costs of leaving them open are:


Users might answer them inappropriately. On the face of it, this seems unlikely: nobody's even likely to add a "me too" or "thanks" answer any more.
'Community' might occasionally bump unanswered questions to the front page, making it look stale.


The risks/costs of closing are:


Someone has to actually go through and close all the questions. In this case, there are only 20, but that's still time that could be better spent.
Some of the questions might still be relevant and attract further useful answers. Maybe they're tagged 'google-reader' but actually apply to any RSS reader, or to other apps that sync to the 'cloud'. Questions can be re-opened later, but that's an extra barrier to a user who just wants to add some relevant information: they'll probably go away instead of trying to get the question re-opened.


Unless these questions are doing some harm to the site, I don't think it's worth closing them.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I do not agree on the risks described. For the first, GAThrawn already volunteered (and I don't see why we should tell him how to spend his time ;) For the second reason, he already mentioned to leave those RSS questions alone. Moreover, this *Google Reader* issue is just one example, more similar issues/topics might follow. It would be good to be prepared then.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions need five votes to close, so we're not just talking about one person's time here. (A mod could close on their own, but that just increases the risk of making a mistake.) Besides, as you say, we're not just talking about this example: maybe next time there are 200 questions, and it's a much bigger chore.


















tl;dr as long as there is no appropriate close reason, leave them open

I would leave them untouched. There is no real problem with them continuing to exist. One could argue that they will show up as irrelevant search results, and if closed they could be filtered out if the search is made with isclosed:0. But that's the only real argument I can think of.

Since we still had one empty slot and given the fact that I encountered a few of such questions in the last week, I added the following off-topic reason;


  Questions which are Android-independent, such as "Does Carrier X have
  prepaid plans?", are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questionsother
  resources
  that may be appropriate for your question.


It still needs approval by another mod and is up for discussion.

I think I like either this one or the [no piracy one](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/1494/981), but we probably get more of these questions than we do piracy ones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I also have a feeling that we get more android-independ questions then questions about piracy. But of course we can always switch to the other one if this turns out wrong.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should be approved now (I also bolded "Android-independent" in the text; how does that look to you?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For some font related reason - I think it's because I have roboto installed - neither Chrome or Firefox render bold text any different then non-bold text.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Huh, weird.

I am seeing on the https://android.stackexchange.com/toolsTools page that there are flags but there aren't any flags.



As you can see, there is a number next to "flags" in addition to the incorrect count in the right column. There are no flags to handle.

Refreshing didn't help. Nor did going to another page and returning.

This has been happening since at least the revamp to the Closing system.

When I was reviewing a https://android.stackexchange.com/review/first-posts/22996question today, I tried to make some changes to the title and content of the question. This is something I have done before with no problem, but this time I ran into an error message:


  This edit would have to be a suggested edit.


As I have less than 2000 reputation points, I have always done suggested edits; I lack permissions to do anything but.

What is this error message? It is useless to me, 

Could it be related to the fact that I am so close to 2000 points? Has the suggested edit functionality been changed with the recent overhaul of closing/holding questions? Is there supposed to be a checkbox saying this is a suggested edit? I'm just throwing out possible avenues; I really have no idea what the problem is.

A https://www.google.com/search?q=%22This+edit+would+have+to+be+a+suggested+edit.%22google search for the exact error message string come back with 0 results, though I suspect in a few minutes there will be a single result for this question. This leads some credence to the error being a new backend change (and probably a bug at that), since no one else has run into it yet.

Edit: Now when I go to that specific question, the edit button is disabled. It isn't disabled for other questions, though. Even on a closed (duplicate) question with a user that has reputation 1, I have an active edit button. What is unique about that question?

Edit 2: The question has been edited by someone else, and I now could edit the question if I so choose. Does the suggested edit functionality get disabled if a user with > 2000 reps starts to edit a question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What does this error mean: This edit would have to be a suggested editb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is funny to me.  Edit collisions have historical given horrid error messages but this is a new one.


















I think what happened here is that there was already a suggested edit pending on that post when you reviewed it. The timeline looks like (all UTC):


18:57 - https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/22997Suggested edit is proposed.
19:09 - You review the post and try to edit it
19:12 - Suggested edit is reviewed and processed


During that window between 18:57 and 19:12, you would be unable to suggest an edit on that post since there is already one awaiting review. Thus, when you tried to make some corrections to the post in the review queue, it returned an error.

Therefore, I'd say the main problem here is that the text of the error message is very poor. If it had said something more like:


  You may not currently suggest an edit to this post because one is already pending.


...then it would have more accurately captured the situation.

FYI the "main" topic is [this](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/190687/152859), feel free to spread the word and hopefully with enough upvotes the team will act.


















I was surprised to find out just now that I had earned the Civic Duty badge. The badge requirement is to vote 300 times.

However, when looking at my profile, I see that the Votes Cast votes tab shows only 267 votes.

Perhaps I voted on questions that were later deleted, which removed the vote from my Votes Cast page but still counted toward the badge.

Any thoughts on why I earned the badge but can only see 267 votes that I cast?

Edit: On my Summary page, it shows I have voted 300 times (which I see before). However, my Votes Cast page has a different tally. See the screenshots attached.

Problem at hand:
The question "https://android.stackexchange.com/q/345/16265How do you link to applications in the Android market?" is being marked as duplicate of the closed question "https://android.stackexchange.com/q/609/16265How to post a link to an android market app? [duplicate]", that in turn mentions the first one as duplicate, causing an infinite cycle.
This appears to happen more often that it should and I am not sure of what's the appropriated action to take with this scenario.
What should be done?
Should this questions be flagged as to report the issue or should one just skip this subject on the review for close votes (assuming that there's already a method to deal with this...) ?

For the sake of future reference, here's some screenshots:

I was contacted privately by an OP of this https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/49099/my-phone-keeps-restarting-itself-just-soon-as-it-boots#comment66322_49099question (now deleted).


  Hi I am the same guy with as here. I found your email by googling your DN . Sorry for contacting you via email but it is really getting very difficult for me to debug the problem. Would you mind if I ask you to come over skype or something like that? 
  
  I am kind of getting desperate since its only a 6 month old phone without any warranty. 
  
  Regards


In my book, it is highly unfair seeking one on one support to resolve the issue, however, time and personal life, working etc... it is deemed unfair to put me in the spot and also unfair on the community, notice how the email sounds desperate and not being patient enough to wait for turn-around time for someone else on this site to answer, nor being patient either does not help.

Sending one on one private email should not be allowed on a community site unless contacted by way of message, or even chat, but on email... no... 

What is the best course of action?

Edit

Just noticed that the OP now has supplied the answer to their own question... sigh

This from, another forum (directly quoted from Modaco), sums it up succinctly.


  It is extremely rude and unfair to contact a person directly and
  expecting personal 1-on-1 support. They have personal lives away from
  the forum and this should be respected.
  
  If you have any questions then ask them in the relevant forum thread.
  If you do not receive an answer straight away then wait. Sometimes it
  may take more than 24 hours for somebody to reply to you. If you do
  not find the answer you are looking for or do not get a reply then try
  re-wording your question giving as much information as possible. Logs
  are useful, screenshots are useful.
  
  These forums are a community and by asking questions openly you are
  helping other members. Asking questions privately is rude and
  inconsiderate to ASE users, and not fair on the rest of the community.

I don't think this is an AE issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Its *etiquette*, there's means to ask for help on the site itself - chat, comments, answers!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is very much in scope for Meta.


















Well, we're all public in some ways. Between all of our linked accounts if someone wants to find a personal email address or web site they're going to find it.

This is very poor etiquette by the person who emailed you. They shouldn't have done it. However, there is nothing Stack Exchange can do to prevent it, nor should the person be "punished" by Stack Exchange because of something they did off the network.

In a way, it's understandable. Very often when you're desperate to find a solution you'll grab at anything that looks like a lifeline.

Personally, I suggest to simply ignore them. Perhaps create a filter to automatically delete any messages from them in the future.

If you're kind, you might respond with something like


  I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I am happy to volunteer some of my time helping the people who ask questions on Stack Exchange, but I can't possibly offer personalized help. Good luck to you.


If you're feeling snarky, you might further respond with something like


  However, if you would be willing to pay my hourly rate of $150 per hour, minimum 10 hours, I can probably be convinced to help out. Of course, I would need that money up front and if this can't be done remotely you'll need to pay my airfare as well.


I wouldn't recommend that last, though. I'd just simply ignore it and twit 'em.

There seems to be little differentiation between these two:


it doesn't belong here, or it is a duplicate... > off-topic because... > Questions about writing and publishing Android apps..
it doesn't belong here, or it is a duplicate... > off-topic because... > This question belongs to another site in the Stack Exchange network > StackOverflow


Most of the times, I see programming questions being flagged with the first reason. It is my understanding that the 1st reason covers:


publishing Android apps
Market-related questions, from a developer perspective
other topics that are primarily of concern to developers


Therefore, we could consider the following as programming, and be moved to StackOverflow:


writing Android apps
writing custom ROMs


Given that StackOverflow has a lot of reviewers, it shouldn't be a problem if we migrated questions that may have been off-topic to them. Anyhow, programming questions should go there, instead of being flagged with the first reason.

Or, is there any other way we could improve this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions about writing applications vs Belongs to StackOverflow in Vote to Closeb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Many of the programming-related questions that I see and vote to close, just don't seem to be good enough questions to be worth migrating. It's not a matter of if they're on-or-off-topic for SO, more that they're just bad questions that happen to have programming content in them. Normally a total lack of details about what's happening, what should be happening and what they've tried.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What GAThrawm and Al Everett said. 90% of the programming questions asked here are crap. But this also means that there are 10% that deserve migration to stackoverflow. That's how I deal with them.


















To expand on GAThrawn's comment...

The first rule of migration is:


  Don't migrate crap.


Migration should be reserved for outstanding questions that just happen to be on the wrong site. Migration should be the exception, not the rule.

The vast majority of development questions we see are not very good. Were we to migrate them to Stack Overflow anyway, they would be quickly downvoted and closed. That's not helpful to anyone and now twice as many people have had to "handle" this really bad question.

Further, a significant portion of the development questions we get here aren't on-topic for Stack Overflow anyway. "How do I get started in Android development" for instance, or "what's wrong with my developer account on the Play Store" are all development "problems" that have no place anywhere in the Stack Exchange network.

So, while I think it can be worthwhile to ensure we get clear and helpful wording for our off-topic closures, we should keep the "Android development" closure reason.

On Android and Meta-Android I'm seeing the flags alert in the header with a count of zero.



While the display of that alert in the past has occasionally been hit-or-miss, I don't think it should be displaying when there are no flags to handle.

Possibly worth noting as well is that I do *not* see the "0", so perhaps it's just the 10k flag counter that's misbehaving.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Appears to be a network-wide issue: [Posts flagged for attention but there are none](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/189856)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This [should be fixed](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/189872/21960).

It is not against the rule, though putting the two is useless (if you do a "htc" search, all htc- tags will show up). I just think that if your problem concern only one particular device, it should have htc-device as tag but not htc. htc tag should be used for problems related to all HTC in general.

I have no idea either wayb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user93353: I don't, but that's the device you mentioned. I strongly prefer _not_ putting device-specific tags on questions unless it is _clear_ that the issue is specific to that type of device. In hindsight I probably should have left it off. The question is clearly not about HTC in general, which is why I removed that tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett How do you know it's not specific to htc-desire-x or just all htcs. When I googled for this issue - I found 4-5 people reporting it in different forums - all htc owners.


















today i posted an question regarding https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/49867/how-does-android-os-worksandroid  os process, this question was closed as

i would like to mention all the sites which accepts this kind of questions and explain it for future references for e.g see this https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20803/how-does-ssl-workquestion.

Kindly clarify,why my question is closed,i agree that question is too broad to explain,but its an common question which will explain the android os functionality
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my question asking about "how Android works" closed as "too broad"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you really want to learn how operating systems work I recommend reading "Modern Operating Systems" by Tanenbaum or for something much lighter try http://computer.howstuffworks.com/operating-system8.htm


















Usually questions that could fill a whole book as answer are closed as "too broad" on all sites within the SX network. I can't comment on why this hasn't happened on the Security SX example question you gave. The have the same https://security.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questionspolicy about "too broad" as any other site. But as eldarathis pointed out, the two questions are not on the same level regarding broadness.

QA sites like Android Enthusiasts work best if you have a specific problem. And no, wanting to know how Android works is not a specific problem.

The Security question, certainly, is *significantly* narrower in scope. You could reasonably summarize how SSL functions in a few sentences if you wanted to (it's a well-defined procedure). Similarly, the question in your above comment is broader than most, but the components are easily explainable **and** extremely common questions. The answer is long because it covers numerous common terms, not because each term requires an essay to describe...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...However, "How does Android work?" is so broad that it's practically *meaningless*. How does **what** work? How is memory managed? How is threading handled? How does the OS layer interact with the hardware? How is the UI rendered? Trying to cover the functionality of the entire OS is asking us to explain, literally, *millions of lines of code* in one post. Not only CAN you write an entire book about operating systems and their design, but such books have already been written and they are **hundreds** of pages long.

  Should we expect that the users have tried to contact tech support when available?


No.  A good chunk of users come to the internet because it's easier than getting tech support.


  If not, should we recommend they try that before doing anything that might void their warranty?


Up to you.  It normally wouldn't be appropriate to provide an answer saying only to contact tech support, but it would be fine as a comment — assuming that it seems to you like something best handled by tech support.

Good point, I shared (and still share) Zuul's concern. Alternative to a question/answer summing up things and pointing to the corresponding answers, this summary could be placed in the corrsponding tag-wikis (https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/calibrationcalibration, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/batterybattery), including links to each other and to the corresponding questions – as it is already done for many other topics (https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lost-phonelost-phone, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/backupbackup to name some examples).

I know this still leaves the question I raised earlier: how can we draw more attention to the tag wikis. I often encounter questions even using the correct tags, where the answer is given in the tags' wiki already. But as with duplicates, some users tend to go straight asking their questions without doing any search either. The big advantage of placing such information in the corresponding tag wikis is: it makes it easy to find, without having to use a search at all. For this reason, even if decided for a "canonical question/answer", this should at least be linked to from the corresponding tag (as we should do for the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/updateupdate tag and the "how do I update my device [to Android x.y.]" questions, to make them easier to find.

5 points is the number of reputation points you receive when someone votes one of your questions up.

"Is there a App for X?" type questions are off-topic. Therefore asking for app alternatives is also off-topic. See the section off-topic on https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicthis help site:

  Recommendations, like "Which phone is better?" or "Can you suggest an app that does X?"
  


But if you phrase your question like "How can I do (insert use case here)?", then your question is perfectly on-topic.

Android Enthusiasts is not meant as an app recommendation site. There are already a dozen sites for that purpose. We want to solve real problems that are affecting users. The solution is often an app, but not always. That is why especially asking for an app is considered bad practice because it's an apparition of the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problemXY Problem.

I created an account to contribute an to an issue.  Now I see that I can't.

I have no idea what hoops I should be jumping through to contribute, but I don't think there should be any.

I need 50 reputation, whatever that means.  I'm sure that kills a lot of posts.  There are thousands of sites like this one that require you to join to comment.  They all want you to hang out, have coffee, make them your home.  Not.

My brand new Nexus 7 is having random wifi connect issues.  But I can't comment on the thread about it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's with reputation? Why do I need some to comment?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might want to read this question: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7237/how-does-reputation-work


















As you've noticed, you need more reputation points to comment on someone else's post than to ask or answer a question. Why's that? Because new users don't always understand how this site is different from a web forum or a mailing list. They don't always realise that Stack Exchange sites have questions and answers, rather than threads and replies. Sometimes, new users think it's appropriate to add a comment to a question to say, "I'm having the same problem too," or to "bump the thread". That's not how this site works. Comments like that don't add anything to the site, so we don't want them. If you're having the same problem as someone else, you can star the question to be notified of new answers.

I notice that you used the term "thread" in your question. Perhaps you've fallen into the same trap: it's an easy enough misunderstanding to make until you read the FAQ or use the site for a while. That misunderstanding is exactly what the privilege system is for. Once upon a time, it was customary to lurk on a mailing list or BBS (that is, to read the site without posting), so that you can learn the conventions and the culture of the site rather than posting in the wrong place. The privilege system exists, in part, to help keep that custom alive here.

It's up to you whether you participate or not. As you say, there are are plenty of web fora out there if that's all you want. But if you stick around, I think you'll find, as I have, that Stack Exchange's reputation and privileges help keep the quality of discourse more productive than you find on the average forum or mailing list.

I'm happy about any feedback on this proposed answer.

It depends on many factors. For example on whenever you think the question is salvageable by editing. If you are able to edit the question to prevent the close vote, consider doing so. Editing is always the best solution.

But if the question is for example unclear, then cast the close vote and motivate questioner to add more information. A down vote is usually not necessary then. 

Finally if the question has severe problems that are most likely not solvable, then consider to cast also a downvote with your close vote. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/92006/156683Closed, negative score questions will automatically get deleted after 9 days. They don't have to go through the vote to delete process.

Background: Before 2013-08-05, certain closed questions received an automatic downvote from community. This process took care to keep AE's delete vote queue short by creating mostly negative score closed questions, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/190947/is-it-time-to-be-rid-of-automatic-down-votes-on-certain-closed-questionsbut the behavior was changed. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Full ack: A close-vote (VTC) means it doesn't fit on ASE. A down-vote (DV) has different meaning (quality, no research/effort shown, for example). So "Please advice me which phone to buy" should get VTC and DV, while with a given reason (e.g. "I'm visually impaired...I already checked with...but could not find anything useful") should get VTC (shopping) but not downvoted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another consideration is: certain closed questions with 0 or negative scores will be auto-deleted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That is basically the motivation for this post. I have also put a link with a detailed description about this feature in my answer. Note that questions with a 0 score are not auto deleted after 30 days.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, *closed* negatively-scored questions will get automatically deleted after **9** days, provided there aren't any up-voted answers. After 30, the question doesn't even need to be closed - if it's unanswered and < 0, it'll be removed.

EDIT #1: After Flow edited his question, my personal comment earlier is no longer relevant. However, I still agree on the Answer on the SO Meta posts above.

Generally, we should edit to make the question clearer. If it's lacking information, we ask for clarifications via comments. We ask them to edit that into their question, or we update it ourselves, based on their comments. 

We can either be proactive or guide them to read the guidelines. But I prefer to be more proactive, as if I were gathering requirements from the customer. We ask in a way that we get what we exactly need to make it understandable for us and for everybody.

Regarding edits (and based on recent experience), chances are we may not always get it right. It happens. We're either too tired to understand / interpret it correctly (or it's not in our domain of expertise). OR, it could be that the question itself is too confusing to be rephrased. BUT, we can try to make it simpler and easier to read / understand. If our interpretation was wrong, the OP can always comment or improve our attempts to edit. This is peer review in action; we can't always be right.

When all else fails - meaning, the question is helpless - the VTC and downvotes come in.

A User just marked three different questions and three different answers as duplicates and I challenge anyone to review them.


https://android.stackexchange.com/q/51198/7425Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Failed to detect compatible download-mode device.”
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/51065/7425Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Partition ”recovery“ does not exist in the specified PIT.”
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/51062/7425Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Failed to confirm end of file transfer sequence!”


According to @t0mmb13b, 1 is a dupe of 2. 2 is a dupe of 3. And, 3 is a dupe of 1 and 2. This is nothing short of a total failure to read any of them. I took time to enter these errors into android.stackexchange.com. I didn't do it for me, I did it for others that may run into these problems with Heimdall. They're all self-answered. And, all of these shared a similar format in the title for easy disambiguation by visitors and search engines. All of these errors are caused by different symptoms so I'll summarize them here.

The numbers correspond to the above


This is caused by the device not being in download mode. The device must be put in a different mode.
This is caused by the command's partition argument being lowercase. This is really awkward for a Linux/GNU guy, because heimdall (5) breaks convention, that --argument is the same as --ARGUMENT, what should have happened is that heimdall should have done --partition_name "ARGUMENT" instead. For those who make these most basic-assumptions about Linux utilities, Heimdall is likely to cause confusion. The error message heimdall produces is also useless for most people.
This is caused by a bug in a release candidate of heimdall. It simply needs to be updated. Why is this important if it's just a release candidate then? Simple, heimdall is frozen at 1.4rc1 in the https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/heimdall-flashUbuntu repository.


Users need to read the questions and answers before they comment. This kind of closing of questions and answers just discourages involvement. The onus can't be on the submitter to explain why his stuff is different when the judge, jury, and executioner was simply too lazy to read.

Otherwise it's fine to raise such a topic on meta. Just keep it polite.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Isn't it slightly inauthentic to roll back my original commentary while at the same time making notice of alleged negative undertones? I mean, it seems like if the problem is resolved you should let the question stand as it sits -- people aren't upvoting or downvoting past-revisions unless a user alerts them to those revisions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"alleged"? "undertones"? You insulted a user in the original revision. The commentary is just a notice to readers who are wondering why there are so many down votes on the question.


















Your https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/1558/1initial post was way to offensive. I am considering to delete it all together and taking additional measures, but first I want say a few words.

There is absolutely no need to insult anyone. A user voted on some of your questions, so what? Nothing happened, and even if something had happened: Everything within the Stackexchange network can be reverted.

Why is it a problem to explain why you think your questions aren't duplicates, if somebody else doesn't think so? What's wrong with a discussion to find a consensus? Besides, nothing has happened, there was no 'executioner' involved.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Full ack. Though from time to time one of us (mostly me ;) look like a little "trigger-happy", we are far from being careless. What you (Evan) call "too lazy to read" is rather an indicator that your postings have not been clear, and were hard to understand/follow/read.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EvanCarroll to be honest: All I've noticed was a small mis-match in the title. The entire content confused me (which I ascribed to not having a Sammy and not being used to Heimdall); but the one question I looked at (device not detected) essentially contained the answer to one of the other questions, just preceded by 2 or 3 lines matching the question. So all I had was a vague feeling. But as said, not being familiar with Heimdall I decided to "skip over" in the review queue, as I felt I didn't understand enough of it.


















Having read the original revision of your post, I'm a little surprised that such an experienced user wouldn't have a better way of dealing with his posts being VTC'ed. Things may be different in the crowded, shouty city of Stack Overflow, but ASE is above all a friendly site. Mistakes happen sometimes, and if we think someone has made a bad call, we try to persuade them civilly and rationally, without name-calling or hyperbole. It's a struggle sometimes, and everyone has an off day now and then, but it makes the site more rewarding for everyone and ultimately more involving. If you think you can manage to join us in a friendly discussion, then we can help resolve any problems together. If you can't manage that, then the warning that we are discouraging your involvement won't trouble us greatly.

I must admit that I was a little uncertain when I read your posts. We've occasionally had problems on ASE with users posting several similar questions to promote a commercial product, or some very confused users trying to get a tutorial by asking about one step at a time (e.g. "How do I install adb?" "What custom ROM can I use for this device?" "How do I install Odin?" "How do I connect this device to my computer?" "How do I unlock the bootloader?" etc. instead of simply "How do I install a custom ROM?"). And we sometimes get one user re-posting the same completely off-topic question over and over, with slightly different wordings, to try to get it considered on-topic.

For this reason, when I saw a succession of (on the face of it) similar questions, all self-answered, all from the same user, I was immediately on the alert: not because of anything particularly wrong with the questions, but because we've had problems with similar-looking questions. It took me quite some reflection, and reading the questions several times, to convince myself that you're "on the level" (i.e. that you're posting in good faith, and that you understand we're not trying to be Wikipedia). The regular users on the site are quite a mix: some (like me) are developers, some make a living through Android in various ways, and some are just keen users who don't touch the command-line if they can help it. Given all of these factors, I'm not at all surprised that a close-vote was thrown in haste.

As you're an experienced user on other SE sites, I know you don't really believe that one close-vote constitutes an "execution". But if it troubles you so much, I can think of some things you might do next time to avoid even that:-


Phrase your question as a question. None of your posts contains a question. They're all just error messages and transcripts of terminal sessions. If you weren't answering your own question, we'd say, "What are you asking? Is it 'what does the error mean?' or 'how can I get past it?' What are you trying to achieve when you get this error?" In fact, if your aim is to make posts that are useful to future visitors, I'd recommend that you add those details now, to make the questions more understandable. It should have the side-effect of making it easier to see that they're not the same question.
If you're planning something a little out-of-the-ordinary, such as a 'dump' of useful information on one topic, it doesn't hurt to drop into our chat-room and let us know that you're going to do it. Or ask on meta, "I just did some stuff with Heimdall. Is it OK if I post a series of questions and answer them myself, to document the problems I overcame?" (The answer will certainly be yes: the idea's not to get permission, but to alert us.) It's not necessary, but that way, it won't be a surprise to the regulars, and we are less likely to jump to conclusions or get 'trigger-happy'.


To reiterate: I don't think there's anything wrong with your questions. On ASE, we're just not used to getting helpful content in this manner. When we get several similar posts from one user, it's more commonly spam or otherwise unhelpful. I can see why you might be irritated that someone made a bad call in this case, and if you can rise above that irritation and stay civil, we'll respect you all the more for it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for the conclusion! I also had a little hard time with those questions, in the very same way. I'd even make the numbered lists first sentence bold to emphasize :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see what is out of the ordinary about either questions that indicate an error, and are not preceded by *"What causes this"*, or *"How do I resolve"*, nor do I see what is out of the ordinary about dumping useful resolutions to OSS-problems. If I asked either of those questions you suggest, *"what does this error mean"*, or *"how do I get past it"*, I'd have to self-answer twice as many prompts to give the same amount of information. Maybe I was too *standoffish* in trying resolve someone else's mistake but there was nothing whatsoever wrong with the content, or the submission.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The better question remains (1) why are these questions still marked as dupes having been defended, and *no one* claiming otherwise? And, (2) why is that no one is mentioning or reprimanding the user who mistakenly  duped 3 questions on a topic he didn't understand, clearly having not read them?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@EvanCarroll: What kind of reprimand would be proper for such a situation? You put it pretty accurately yourself, he "mistakenly duped 3 questions..." but it's not like some kind of great moral injustice took place here. The questions were never even closed since other community members disagreed with the suggested dupe (and defended your questions), so the close votes will decay harmlessly. Isn't that the close system working as intended? What were you intending to accomplish by attempting to crucify a user for a mistake that thus far has had no meaningful impact?


















There are 19 questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-controlremote-control.

There are 7 questions tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-accessremote-access. (Of these, 5 are also tagged https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-controlremote-control; 2 are not.)

What's the difference between the two tags? Should they be merged?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's the difference between the 'remote-control' and 'remote-access' tags?

"Remote access" doesn't necessarily imply seeing the UI while accessing the device.


















I would agree to merging them.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-controlremote-control is described as as:


  Remotely control your Android device from any other device/computer,
  or vice versa.


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-accessremote-access is described as:


  Methods to remotely access a device from another device, where at
  least one of the two should be running Android.


Interestingly, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-desktopremote-desktop is a synonym of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-accessremote-access, which makes it even more confusing if Al Everett describes https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/remote-controlremote-control as seeing the "desktop".

UPDATE #1: However, we could probably make a distinction between:


Accessing an Android device from another device (may or may not be an Android device)
Accessing a non-Android device from an Android device


However, the second point may be useless, given that it may be via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, except accessing the file system of your device from, say, your PC over wifi is in no wise "remote control". It _is_ remote access, though. I suggest there is a distinction; we just need to get the wikis to illustrate that (and tag questions appropriately).


















It depends a little. IMHO it is clearly on-topic as long as it is user-oriented (and not development-oriented), even it might be a "power-user's terrain". And even more on-topic if it's clearly something Android specific (as you've already indicated, many commands are "a little different", e.g. not all options are available to them).

But as you've asked for "the best site", there's also a second point to consider: If it's a generic quesion on available commands, or how to deal with things like redirecting output, piping, listing directories etc., that might fit better on either https://unix.stackexchange.com/Unix & Linux or https://superuser.com/Super User (at least you should check the questions there before, as you might find yours already answered).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@lzzy - I almost posted a developer answer here ... without veering off topic too much, which Stack Exchange site would be the correct one for developer command line questions specific to android, would that be StackOverflow ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That very much depends on the question itself. If it can be phrased to represent a power-user's concern, it fits on ASE. If not, but rather is at e.g. integrating it with some app, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android) is the better place (note the tag the link points to). Difficult to give a straight generic answer on that.


















The following tags are overly broad, misapplied, meta tags https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1284/what-are-meta-tags1http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/2, ambiguous or are otherwise problematic.

Important

Do not simply fix the tag and nothing else. Very often there are multiple inappropriate tags, not to mention there are almost always spelling, grammar, and/or formatting issues to be addressed. Fix the whole question. While you're at it, check any answers on the question for similar issues.

On the other hand, don't bother fixing questions that should be closed and/or deleted. Just vote/flag them as appropriate.

Remember: we don't migrate crap.

Pro-tip #1

If you are removing tags from a large number of questions, it's better to go to the last question on the last page of all questions with that tag and work your way backwards. This prevents you from having to deal with the cache not reflecting your edits on the question list combined with browser-cache issues.

If you haven't visited most of these questions, you'll know what you changed because the link for the question will have a different color.

Pro-tip #2

Please edit in small batches and be mindful of front-page flooding – we don't want the entire front page to be filled with edits of old questions. Do three or five edits at a time, then come back later.



Let us know when a tag has been cleaned up. Even better, let us know about tags you think need cleaning.

For the most part, URL shorteners should not be used here.

Their primary benefit—fitting long URLs into artificially scarce text spaces—is of no use here. The Question and Answer spaces are plenty large enough to handle 99.99% of all URLs. Even the comment space is plenty big enough for most.

On the downside, however, URL shorteners can be (and have been) used to hide:


spam
links with affiliate codes
malware
LMGTFY


Almost all URL shorteners should be fixed to be their target URL. The following links are to searches on the main site to find posts with these URL shorteners in them.

Note also that some instances should stay. Explaining how to use an URL shortener, for instance, is okay. Use your best judgment.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2696/when-will-my-phone-get-the-android-2-2-update-froyoFroyo and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2695/when-will-my-phone-get-the-android-2-3-update-gingerbreadGingerbread each added a lot of changes compared to their predecessors. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/7680/when-will-my-device-get-the-android-3-x-update-honeycombHoneycomb caused a lot of confusion, what with it only ever being available for a very few tablets. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/14766/when-will-my-device-get-the-android-4-0-update-ice-cream-sandwichIce Cream Sandwich was a big deal, with a lot of changes. Each of the https://android.stackexchange.com/q/24575Jelly https://android.stackexchange.com/q/32589Bean https://android.stackexchange.com/q/49832iterations, less so (although "Project Butter" was a significant improvement).

The idea with the first of these Community Wiki questions was to act as a repository of knowledge and to short-circuit the plethora of "When will {name of device} get Android {version}?" questions that we saw.

Are these still needed?

By all indications, the Nexus 5 and Android 4.4 (KitKat®) are going to be released in about four weeks. The last few Nexus devices will get it (those not encumbered by carrier customizations, that is, like my Verizon Galaxy Nexus) and the flagship devices of the big OEMs within a few months.

But will we really be saving ourselves from a bunch of "When will {name of device} get Android 4.4?" questions if we make another Community Wiki?

Google has done a lot to move key functionality out of the OS into updateable apps/services. (By golly, remember when we had to get an Android update to get a new Gmail?) There's not much of anything in Android 4.3 that I feel like I'm missing on my VZW GNex at 4.2.2. Things are much different now than when a new version of the OS made the device feel brand new.

Also, it takes time and effort to keep those lists updated. Even though they're Community Wiki, I've only ever seen a handful of people add information to the answers. Plus, they get out-dated. No one is clamoring for information on Froyo or Gingerbread, and few are still looking for information on Ice Cream Sandwich. Anyone still on prior versions there have resigned themselves to the version they have or have taking the plunge with a custom ROM.

So, should we continue to create and maintain these Community Wiki Android version questions/answers?

More importantly, if we don't, how should we handle the inevitable "When will {name of device} get Android {version}?" questions?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it time to stop with the "When will my device get Android X.X" questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well it didn't take long for [our first "Will I get KitKat?" question](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/56110/galaxy-nexus-and-kitkat) after the announcement, so I've added yet another of these wikis. Open to other ideas, as I do agree with all the problem points you raise here.


















I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of "Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them).

I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the "When will my device get..." questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable "When will {name of device} get Android {version}?" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You're right. Without an alternative there's no tenable way to discontinue what we're doing. I'll add some extra emphasis to my question.


















This site is copying StackExchange questions. It seems like a spam site. They probably have ads, but I'm using an ad blocker. I was searching for something and came across my own question.

Perhaps we can rename https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nexus-7nexus-7 to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nexus-7-2012nexus-7-2012, and create a new https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nexus-7-2013nexus-7-2013 for the 2nd generation tablet.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have a nexus-7-2013 tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or handle it like we do with the Samsung Galaxy 7 tab, and just create a `nexus-7-2` tag? That would at least be consistent.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Yeah, that seems better for consistency.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All the references I see when specifically about one or the other references the year.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Does anyone know what the Apple SE does now that Apple have dropped version numbers for the iPad?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GAThrawn It seems they only have 1 tag: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipadb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we really need separate tags? Do we have that many questions about either Nexus 7?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett - As the guy who's been running the tag cleanup efforts, I would think you'd recognize the benefit of having specific tags ready to go before they become seriously needed so users can either tag their questions properly or so someone can correct them right off the bat rather than having to retag dozens of questions at once.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, and by-and-large we _don't_ need _device-specific_ tags.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlEverett Would you like to add that as an answer, so at least we can all vote on something and have a general concensus?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For what it's worth, a refreshed Galaxy Note 10.1 was just announced, and it's being referred to by the year (2014).


















As per my comment on the question itself, if the differences between those generations justify separate tags, we should handle that similar to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsung-galaxy-tab-2-7samsung-galaxy-tab-2-7 for two reasons:


consistency
easier handling (nobody will stick to the year in the tag, most will even confuse it)


From the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsung-galaxy-tab-2-7samsung-galaxy-tab-2-7 tag wiki: It is the successor to the original Galaxy Tab 7.0 – so we have the same issue here.

so IMHO we should keep the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nexus-7nexus-7 tag as-is, and (if necessary) just add a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nexus-2-7nexus-2-7 (though I wonder if it shouldn't be nexus-7-2 for "Nexus 7, 2nd generation", and samsung-galaxy-tab-7-2 respective).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nexus-7-2 makes more sense than Nexus-2-7 to meb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To me as well; but the same applies to the existing galaxy tab tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The reason the GT one is `galaxy-tab-2-7` is because that is the *actual name* of the device ([Galaxy Tab 2 7.0](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/GT-P3113TSYXAR)). The Nexus 7 2 is not a device, and neither is the Nexus 2 7. `nexus-7-2013` seems like it makes the most sense from that standpoint.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about `nexus-7-2gen`?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow I guess the "gen" suffix might be a bit confusing as well. Though I know we're talking about "second generation" here, it took me a second to take it for such (first thought was "genesis", don't ask me why). Do we really need a suffix? If so, what about `nexus-7-2nd` or `nexus-7-v2`? Looks a little more intuitive to me :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis I'm afraid latest in 2014 confusion begins if you take year numbers. People will remember they bought the device in 2013 and use that tag for their 1st gen device. For others with the 2nd gen it seems that long ago, they might think it was 2012. And the 3rd group just pickst the first tag popping up, being completely confused. Add a year more (2015), and guess what will be then...


















I think it should be https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nexus-7-2012nexus-7-2012 and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nexus-7-2013nexus-7-2013.  

Here's my reasoning:


https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Nexus_7_2012_16GB?id=nexus_7_16gbNexus 7 (2012) is what Google themselves calls the old device on the Play Store.
The wikipedia articles on the devices are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_%282012_version%29Nexus 7 (2012 version) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_%282013_version%29Nexus 7 (2013 version).
https://www.google.ca/search?q=%22nexus%207%202013%22A Google search shows 102 million hits for "Nexus 7 2013", versus only https://www.google.ca/search?q=%22nexus%207%202%2233.8 million for "Nexus 7 2", and https://www.google.ca/search?q=%22nexus%207%202nd%20generation%22a mere 3.5 million for "Nexus 7 2nd generation" so the former is clearly the more common naming.

A minor issue to be sure, and perhaps an edge case, but...

When a user has a fairly high reputation and a good number of badges, and edits a post by someone else, the user card can get truncated. Like so:



Note that the "106" next to the bronze badge icon is overwritten by the user card next to it.

This is on Google Chrome 29. I also see it on Firefox 23 but not IE 10. (All on Windows 7.)

My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay ("How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?") should go to http://gaming.stackexchange.comArqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive.

Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like "How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose.

I'm not sure we need to make explicit mention of it either, unless it's going to be an issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unless we get a lot more such questions in future, I'd say just shut the questions as off-topic and direct people to go ask a Arqade.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, Moderators can migrate a question anywhere. If we happen to get an excellent question in the wrong place, we should ask for it to be migrated.

You can help!

Important

Do not simply fix the tag and nothing else. Very often there are multiple inappropriate tags, not to mention there are almost always spelling, grammar, and/or formatting issues to be addressed. Fix the whole question. While you're at it, check any answers on the question for similar issues.

On the other hand, don't bother fixing questions that should be closed and/or deleted. Just vote/flag them as appropriate.

Remember: we don't migrate crap.

Pro-tip #1

If you are removing tags from a large number of questions, it's better to go to the last question on the last page of all questions with that tag and work your way backwards. This prevents you from having to deal with the cache not reflecting your edits on the question list combined with browser-cache issues.

If you haven't visited most of these questions, you'll know what you changed because the link for the question will have a different color.

Pro-tip #2

Please edit in small batches and be mindful of front-page flooding – we don't want the entire front page to be filled with edits of old questions. Do three or five edits at a time, then come back later.



Let us know when a tag has been cleaned up. Even better, let us know about tags you think need cleaning.

We don't have tags for other versions of HTML.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would imagine that we don't have tags for other versions of HTML because the previous version is almost 14 years old, so it can safely be assumed that if one talks about just "HTML", they mean "HTML 4.01".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Still and all, I don't think we need to distinguish between them on a site about _Android_.

Heck, I'm not sure we even need the HTML tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since we are not on a developer site, I think we can change all "html" and "htmlx" tagged questions to "browser" since it will be a browser problem (or a programming problem and so it doesn't belong here).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Macros is now clearb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Untagged is clear again.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Untagged" always comes back.


















Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack.

The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat.

One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time.

If preparing a long question or answer I tend to create the post in an offline editor, then open the relevant page, then paste.  This always triggers a CAPTCHA.


















I propose that that line should instead read:


  Issues with Google Play (or any other app marketplace) from the point of view of a developer or publisher


This way, we get to make it clear that issues with Amazon App Store etc. (from the POV of a developer) are also off-topic.

We get a lot of spam answers (and I've just seen a spam edit) with links to domains selling dubious software. There are a few websites that claim to offer tutorials for recovering data from a broken phone, but the "tutorial" is an advert for PC software.

The links are added indiscriminately by newly registered or anonymous users, often to inappropriate questions, and also sometimes to questions where they would be a reasonable answer. The text themselves is often spammy-looking, repeating the same phrasing several times or pasting text from their site, for SEO purposes. Even when the answers are sometimes relevant, I don't think we ought to encourage commercial users to follow this scatter-shot approach and rely on our users spending time deciding which posts might be appropriate.

The websites in question look suspicious because (1) they don't give any contact details or official information on the company selling the software, not even a country of origin; (2) they offer a PC software download for an Android problem; (3) they have heavy use of SEO keywords, often with a separate URL per device; (4) often they hide their WHOIS information to make sure you can't find out who they are. These are not properties of honest software businesses.

Domains I've seen people try to link to include:


istonsoft.com (hidden whois information)
swesoft.com (based in CN)
android-data-recovery-software.com (same owner as swesoft)
z0download.com (hidden whois information; https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/42916/2here's a huge edit that added this link)
yodot.com (hidden whois information; https://android.stackexchange.com/a/39595/12442here's an answer)
android-mobile-manager.com (hidden whois information)


We have a zillion questions on recovering deleted files, and AFAICT they all attract this kind of spammy answer/edit. Certainly, several have been protected for this reason. I'm proposing to reduce the number of spam answers/edits that get through review, and to reduce the load on reviewers, by stopping our repeat offenders earlier.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we blacklist some domains to reduce spam?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From Meta.SO [Join the crusade against r0uter-switch.com Content Spam](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/209443/133427) Seems that it's possible. I've seen some of those isotonsoft vandal edits this week, too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So just as a PSA of sorts, another behavior these sites have begun using to try to fly under the radar is posting a seemingly innocuous answer and then returning to edit the link in later in a somewhat subtle, inline manner (sometimes on the order of several *weeks* after the answer was originally posted, with the OP of the answer performing the edit so it won't be reviewed). If you see any of these links, definitely don't hesitate to flag them, because I actively search for and destroy accounts that exist to promote them. The sheer volume makes it pretty obvious that they're spam.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis I've seen a few "first posts" lately that appear to be machine-generated (using some Dissociated-Text-like algorithm) that are probably for that purpose. I've been flagging them as spam even when they contain no spam link. Other reviewers, keep your eyes open!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On Music our spammers are much dumber -- they've been trying anonymous suggested edits, which never go through. Kind of hilarious how dumb they are.


















Yeah, we can blacklist specific URLs or domains. 

But it's unlikely to help here. 

Blacklisted terms are fairly easy to work around; if spam is being posted or edited in manually, then it's not too much more difficult for the spammer to use a URL shortener or alternate domain to circumvent the restriction.

For those 4 domains, I've found only 6 posts and 2 suggested edits that match any of them (that includes past revisions of posts and rejected edits). Combined with the similarities you've observed, this suggests spammers are already fairly comfortable using "throw away" domains to avoid detection.

We've taken steps recently to beef up our spam detection systems; the best thing you can do is to flag posts that've been created by spammers, and mark any spam-creating suggested edits appropriately as well. All of this feeds into a database that can block future attempts without the need for further intervention.

It's the time of the year again, namely it is December 2013, and so we shall now refresh our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting Android apps
the site's twitter account
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 220 x 250 pixels
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1602here.

Preamble

I have read the https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/782/where-can-i-find-x-rom-questions-should-be-treated-like-shopping-questionsMETA and the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/17152/where-can-i-find-stock-or-custom-roms-for-my-android-deviceWIKI product of it and then followed by the self answered https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1542/please-keep-the-where-can-i-find-roms-question-broadly-usefulMETA so just wanted to make clear I am not asking this question lightly or without extensive reading and research of existing discussion. I just feel that some valuable (however subtle) perspective is missing in the decision to generalize discussion on this subject due possibly to the lack of actual development experience or participation in the evolution of the HIY. Either of these would make it clear that while many might be lazy players who are shopping for "cool" things to check out and play with, there are those who legitimately want to learn about their device, explore its capabilities and expand on them if possible. We should be focused on the latter and not deprive more in depth discussion for fear of the "shoppers" as they have been called. The benefit far outweighs any sinister abuse which can be easily moderated out.

Argument

I believe that there is a very legitimate case to be made for allowing more than cursory discussion on custom ROMs this community is dedicated to Android and part of that is the open source and customization nature of it. This means that people try to expand functionality, remove limitations and all in all try to develop a better experience. While as professionals we might argue that general sources are sufficient to decide for one's self what to do and how to go about exploring the options, what happens to the more novice members who look to a community such as this for insight, expertise, shared experience knowledge and assistance.

Why not allow a user to say, I am using Device X from Provider Y and I would like to find a ROM that allows me to remove the bloatware that was installed on there and expand functionality, GUI, tweaks, and so on; what would work best with my setup? People who can apply their general knowledge to help narrow the sea of ROMs and suggest a few can help. Those who own the same device and have experimented with various ROMs can share their experiences first hand and make suggestions and give notes and warnings. Those who own the device but were too green or unaware of a way to expand functionality can benefit by learning from the discussion. It can serve as a truly great way to engage the masses and while some devices might be extremely localized and limited in scope, others will be useful to a much greater range of people. Either way, it will make this community a beacon of knowledge that has been amassed and shared. Who does it hurt to discuss specifics? For every 1 person who is active in the discussion there are 100's if not more who are benefiting from reading and referencing the discussion. Long after it has been resolved for the OP, the discussion will remain for any future seeker who find it and resolves their problem, living up to the goal of such a community. 

Isn't that what we want? I don't understand sometimes the elitist approach taken to what question is allowed and what is not. If it relates to Android, however broad or narrow, its relevant and should be allowed, as long as it is not abusive, offensive, illegal, or promotion. Thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why can't I ask "What's the best ROM for me?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The best way to attract downvotes is to put "please don't downvote" in the post.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What makes me wonder more is that there are so less upvotes. Although the question text is quite long, it's a perfectly fine question. [Please down downvote meta questions if you don't agree.](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/whats-meta)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If people are so ignorant and petty as to use the solicitation they participate rather than downvote and run as a reason to downvote, then so be it, trolls shall be trolls.


















Custom ROMs aren't a special topic: they're relevant to Android, so a question on custom ROMs is allowable and encouraged, as long as it fits the other criteria. One of those is that it should be a specific question answerable with facts. Questions that solicit discussion or opinions are discouraged simply because they don't fit well with the question-and-answer format of a Stack Exchange site.

The example you gave, "What would work best with my setup?" is a perfect example of a question that asks for opinions. What's the best option is usually different for each person. The question would end up with dozens of answers, "I tried this ROM and I liked such-and-such but this-and-that didn't work for me." That wouldn't be a beacon of knowledge, it'd be an unreadable mess.

The key word in your post is "discussion". You say several times that you want to encourage discussion. If you stick around for a while, you'll quickly see that SE sites just don't work well for discussion. It's not a question of "elitism", it's just a question of what the SE format can handle and what it can't. If you really want to understand why, you'll find a fuller reasoning of why this is so, based on other sites' experience (but applicable to any SE site) on metaso.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is excellently written and entirely correct. One thing I will note is that it's important to remember that *we are not trying to be the only resource for Android knowledge on the Internet*. There are **lots** of websites that allow you to discuss Android, and they are frankly better equipped for that discussion than we are. Stack Exchange sites are intended to serve one specific piece of that knowledge puzzle: providing expert answers to discrete, answerable questions. We serve that need because nobody else does, but it doesn't mean we can (or should) try to serve *all* needs.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What you call a mess is called a community knowledge sharing and helpful to the person who asks it and the countless people in the same boat needing the same information, you guys are being extremely narrow minded and elitist in your idea of question/answer. A question is a question and the answers to it are answers, there shouldn't be a precondition on how complicated or "messy" it might get, otherwise, if everything allowed is only what can be answered with one answer, then we are not running a community, we are running a one on one consulting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i agree with   eldarerathis at 100%. Stackexchange is a specific knolowedge with a fast ask/answer format, without the personal things as possible (discussion). Anyway, i wont blame you. There's no dumb questions except the dumb ones.

If I am not missing something serious, I am seeing this site with horrible readability.

"Modified freely" seems to be the key phrase there.  I'm also not sure what you think is wrong about it — is it the wrong color?  As GAThrawn mentions, Meta always use a grayscale theme.

yeah, you are right. it's about the color


















The first thing to understand was that this Stack Exchange http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/18238/android-enthusiastssite graduated from beta to a full site two and a half years ago. The design was set up at that time, and at that time http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-3.0-highlights.htmlAndroid v3.x aka Honeycomb was the newest version of the Android OS. You can see the thoughts from https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/users/84/jinJin, Stack Exchange's designer in this post: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/339/design-ideas-for-android-se-site?rq=1Design ideas for Android.se Site. (follow-up design talks: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/405/Design mockups for final site theme, https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/417/New Design Launched & https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/771/Roboto is the new Droid.

The honeycomb-ed background is obviously based on the idea of Android Honeycomb, and in my opinion is nicely understated, just adding a bit of texture to the page. It's also  physically isolated from the input boxes, which are either surrounded by white or black, so I'm not sure what the relevance of being nearly the same colour as the border of the input box has? You could certainly make an argument that Honeycomb is a fairly old version of Android now, but at the same time re-designing the site every time a new version of Android releases is probably a bit more work than Stack Exchange have time for while they're still busy launching new sites every month, all with their own unique designs.

The "green-ish question title and other texts" points exactly to Android, for the reason that you yourself mention, that green colour is #A4C639.


  this Meta site is not using Android's bot logo properly


If you have a look around the Stack Exchange network, "meta" sites always use a desaturated/greyed-out/monochrome version of the main site's theme. The site/Android logo on the main Android.SE site is based on #A4C639, the logo for the meta site is just  a grey version of the same logo. Android's branding guidelines allow for this sort of modification, monochrome-ing a logo is very different from making it pink with yellow polka-dots.

that said, do you have any specific suggestions for how these things could be improved?

my main concern is to (in process of evolution)

It seems to me that the quality of this SE site is low. Most questions appear to be about minor issues/bugs rather than Android itself. Should something be done about the quality or allowed topic?

Examples:

This seems like a bug rather than a "real" Android issue - https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/34427/google-nexus-7-not-recognized-via-usbGoogle Nexus 7 not recognized via USB

Use Google - https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/59250/is-there-a-valid-android-alternative-to-itunes-uIs there a valid Android alternative to iTunes U?

Too Localized? - https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/57933/how-to-connect-your-nexus-phone-to-a-vga-projectorHow to connect your Nexus phone to a VGA projector?



Did this break the rules? - https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/21566/whats-the-risk-of-installing-cyanogen-mod-on-unsupported-phoneWhat's the risk of installing Cyanogen Mod on unsupported phone?

Some questions are accepted even though they are questions open to debate. See (https://android.stackexchange.com/tourhttps://android.stackexchange.com/tour) - "Questions with too many possible answers, or that would require an extremely long answer". The user in the above link asks for possible risks, which is not easily answered question, thus breaking the quoted rule. Yet, this user's question received many upvotes.



I think it would also help this site if the criteria for good Android questions were more "clear cut".

EDIT NOTE: I removed everything about Cyanogenmod since that seemed to confuse the people reading it. Yes, I understand the definition of Cyanogenmod and Raspbian.

They work best for questions that are about a specific problem that have a single, correct solution. (Or, at least, the potential for one.) That said, [tag:cyanogenmod] is on-topic here, for the most part. Questions about modding it or otherwise getting into the _programming_ part of it are not. Note also that we're not trying to be the be-all/end-all of Android knowledge. For some topics there are better places to go.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Questions with too many possible answers, or that would require an extremely long answer" is the 'too broad' close reason, which is meant for questions that have no value because they are too broad. I think that this isn't true for "What's the risk of installing Cyanogen Mod on unsupported phones". It is a concern that many users who want to install CM on their unsupported phones share.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow Okay, thanks. That makes since. Should the rules be made more clear?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Made more clear" in what way? The "rules" are purposely a little vague to allow for flexibility and change. What was accepted here a few years ago is different than we would accept today, primarily because we've come to see what works and what doesn't. It also allows us to break our own rules when it would be more useful to do so. (See the various "When will my device get Android X.Y" questions, which violate our anti-speculation guideline, strictly speaking, but are quite useful and so we keep them.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think, perhaps, I'm not seeing exactly what you're driving at. By all means, we would like _more_ Android experts here to answer the meatier questions. But that means we need more meaty questions. It's a chicken-and-egg problem. Also, too, this format does not lend itself to a lot of back and forth like you might have in a discussion forum when you're helping someone who is having trouble installing a custom ROM. "Do this." "Okay. Now this error happens." "Okay, flim the flommer." "Where's the flommer?" etc. Here, we want: Here's a question. Here's an answer. Done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This site also has more than its share of hit-and-run askers. A large percentage of the people asking questions come in, ask their question, and never come back, or certainly never come back after they get their answer. It's hard to engender a culture of good, interesting question asking if the vast majority of questions are from people who've spent all of 10 nanoseconds here. All we can really do in that case is close and delete the worst drek and hope that at least some of these fly-by-night askers are led by example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just to add to add to the modified OS's part of this, see this previous meta question [Are questions on Kindle Fire on-topic for Android?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/631). Amazon's Kindle Fire version of Android is far more heavily modified than things like CyanogenMod, and has far less in common with mainstream Android than CM does, but we've previously agreed to allow that. CM users still have access to Google Apps and the Play Store, Kindle fire users don't have that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OP requested the closure of this post. But as there is no valid closure reason, I simply add the status-completed tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow: Why closure? This would seem to be a valid topic for us to be discussing here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krampus Many users on this thread have stated that they do not understand my point or they do not see this thread's purpose.

I also think some people were put off by the tone of your post. But, _c'est la vie_.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Krampus Then this thread needs to be deleted if it puts people off.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm closing per the OP's request.


















Regarding some of your specific examples:


  This seems like a bug rather than a "real" Android issue - Google Nexus 7 not recognized via USB


I don't really see why that's a problem. People sometimes encounter bugs when using Android. Trying to find a workaround for a bug (if that is the case) is a perfectly reasonable problem to want to solve. How is that not a "real" Android issue? What would be your definition of a "real" Android issue if not an issue you encountered while trying to use Android?


  Did this break the rules? - What's the risk of installing Cyanogen Mod on unsupported phone?


Do you have a specific reason why you think this question is off-topic? What about it is not related to using Android? This seems like a reasonable question for someone unfamiliar with Android/CyanogenMod to ask before they dive in and get themselves stuck in a bad situation.


  Too Localized? - How to connect your Nexus phone to a VGA projector?


I suppose I could see this being kind of a niche question, but I don't think I'd go so far as to say that it's "too localized". That close reason doesn't actually exist anymore as it is, but when it did exist it was generally intended for problems that were only reproducible in the environment of the OP, or questions that were (or would be) rendered obsolete quickly over time. On Stack Overflow a common use was for questions where the error was a typo. Anecdotally, I had my boss come ask me how to do exactly what this question describes before going to a meeting once (he needed to demo an app for some potential clients).



Now, regarding the general quality of the site: yes, we have over the course of this site's existence had a persistent problem with low quality questions, in my opinion. I think part of the problem is that there are a lot of questions that people want to ask that just don't fit on SE sites, which we have chosen not to accept ("Recommend a phone for me", "Help me find an app", etc). There's not a whole lot we can do about these other than to point people to resources that will be able to (possibly) help them, like forums and such.

We also regularly get questions that are just not answerable because they are too vague, usually with regards to bugs or other problems. "My messaging app is force closing. Help me?" is not descriptive enough for us to be helpful, for example. However, I would say that every site ultimately ends up with questions like this, particularly ones focused on end users (though, Stack Overflow certainly gets plenty of dev questions that are simply remarkably poor). Again, we just have to be diligent in keeping the site clean of these questions, and trying to guide the askers into posting more detailed questions.



In sum, I'm not really sure what the end goal of your post is, honestly. I personally don't find the questions you list to be particularly "fuzzy" in terms of their appropriateness, and you haven't really provided specific portions of the on/off-topic guidelines that you think need to be tightened. This makes it kind of difficult (for me, at least) to really provide much in the way of meaningful discussion on the perceived issue.

When you suggest:


  Should the rules be made more clear? 


...then I would recommend that you point out specifically the parts that you find unclear so that we can discuss them. Alternatively, perhaps you could explain what you think the appropriate topics of our site should be, and why. That would at least give us somewhere to start, but definitely do explain clearly the "why" so that we can accurately evaluate the merits of your stance.

I meant for people to think about AskUbuntu's view on what they do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DevynCollierJohnson: I understand that, but I still don't see how it's relevant to the discussion. We're certainly under no obligation to model ourselves after AU. Perhaps more significantly, though, I would say the analogy is flawed. A more accurate framing of CyanogenMod vs Android (IMHO) would be Ubuntu vs Kubuntu/Xubuntu/etc. CyanogenMod is different from vanilla Android, but it's not *that* significant of a departure to be considered an entirely different operating system. Either way, though, I don't even know what AU's policies are, and I don't think that should really matter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand. It is just something to think about. As far as Cyanogenmod is concerned, I was trying to say that the site should make it more clear that Cyanogenmod questions is welcome. Without searching, the site appears to only support Android. For example, AU does not support Super OS, so people coming here may not assume that AE allows Cyanogenmod questions. I think the "Food for Thought" gave you mental nausea. (^u^) I am not trying to pick a fight or anything. I just think outside the box.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DevynCollierJohnson I think the people familiar with AU's rules who come here and assume we have the same ones is going to be an extreme minority :P

That'd almost certainly be closed with the "not Android-specific" reason. Android screens aren't different than the screens used for other smartphones or even other electronics.

This is inspired from this answer to my question - https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/55666/can-there-be-malicious-apps-on-google-play/55670#55670Can there be malicious apps on Google Play?


  Aside of that: In case you're still unsure, pick a good forum and ask. Another good idea is to check other apps from the same developer (just follow the link on his name), and use above criteria on them.


Since currently finding an ad-free application is not easy, is it OK to ask for recommendations (i.e. for example "Can someone recommend an ad-free FTP server that is not a virus")?.

I looked in the FAQ and it said app-recommendations are considered "primarily opinion-based", and if I ask "What is the best app doing X", it would be true, but ad-free and not-virus is just true or false, there is no opinion there.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is it OK to ask about ad-free apps that are not a virus?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even if we allowed app recommendation questions I don't know how that would be useful. Certainly someone coming here to hawk their app isn't going to admit it's malicious. And people who do a quick search in the Play Store to provide a simple link answer but don't actually use the app aren't going to have vetted it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This might also be helpful: [How do I ask a question that may require recommending a product?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/1289)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Recommendations are a definite no.  I absolutely hate the alternate "Is App X ad-free?" questions as well because you can ask that about literally every app.  They are incredibly low value questions and part of the reason I wish the Too Localize close reason was still around.


















I second what https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1626/16575Chenmunka wrote, but want to give you a second hint on how to avoid the "recommendation OT". Here are two questions for the very same purpose, #1 being off-topic, #2 would be perfectly fine:


"Is there any ad-free..." / "Can someone recommend..."
How can I determine whether an app is ad-free, when it requires Internet to work (e.g. a web browser)?


For the second, I could even give you some good answers. So if you ask it, and I don't jump, feel free to ping me in chat :)

If it is just a copy-paste from a single comment, I usually do that and make it a Community Wiki. I fully agree with you, we should not adorn ourselves with borrowed plumes :)

I however skip the Community Wiki part if I combine an answer from multiple comments while adding some more details (or point out connections/background). In that context, I don't feel it unethical to win reputation, as I put some real effort in my post.

During the latter part of the previous we had community moderator elections for [Android.SE]. We are now almost done with the year 2013 and there is no news or announcement such event? Are we not going to have one this year? And why so if we are not?

I just asked this question:
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/59554/problem-pairing-a-device-that-was-previosult-pair-on-nexus-5Problem pairing again Nexus 5 with Alpine car stereo
and added (correctly) the "pairing" tag but was informed by the system that I needed 300 points to add that tag - it then suggest a list of other tags I was allowed to use.  NONE of which was appropriate - 'pairing' IS appropriate.  

So, why doe this site not allow me, a user with over 10000 points on SO and a moderator on the newly defunct OnStartups stack exchange site, to add a pretty basic tag - which would actually help the question get classified better and help people give/find the right answer?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why do I need 300 points to add the "pairing" tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We already have a [bluetooth-pairing tag](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bluetooth-pairing). I don't know that I can say much about the "why", but I guess an SE rep might be able to provide some information. Presumably it's to prevent new users from creating unnecessary tags (or typo tags), which still manages to happen fairly regularly even with the 300 rep threshold in place. Rep from other sites doesn't apply to other privileges either; are you suggesting the "create tags" one should be an exception?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, I see - I thought pairing was already created - but it is not - it is bluetooth-pairing.

I was checking out the http://winterbash2013.stackexchange.com/hat selection today and noticed the following requirement for the Defender of the Realm hat:

Since the event started, I've raised 10 flags, with 100% of them marked "Helpful" (So 0% declined). Yet this hat is still locked for me.

Either way, the hat did eventually come - albeit I can't figure out exactly why it came so late.


















Like so many other things on Stack Exchange (especially badges) I expect that hats are not awarded instantly, but rather there's a scheduled process that runs to find new hats to award.

You'll probably get it in the next few hours, assuming that there's not some other criteria that needs to be met.

I say no.

BlackBerry 10 is supposed to be able to run Android apps, and we don't accept questions about that here.

Stack Exchange sites do best when they're focused enough that they can attract experts, but not so focused that there's not enough content. I have a feeling that Sailfish-related questions would simply languish here, unloved and unanswered.

(If it's big enough, suggesting a Sailfish OS site at http://area51.stackexchange.comArea 51 would not go amiss.)

But no, I don't think Jolla or any Sailfish OS device is on-topic here.

CyanogenMod is an Android distribution but it is gradually becoming its own subsection of Andriod. It may become its own OS in time. We still factor it in and have a tag, but when is it not Android enough? I guess the same could, in theory, apply to Salifish in that regard.

Is it really necessary to have https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4.4.2-kitkat4.4.2-kitkat?

Is there really that much difference from 4.4.0, or, really, anything that would go under https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4.4-kitkat4.4-kitkat?

Frankly, I think that all it does is prompt people to use tags to describe their devices rather than to tag questions which are specific to that version of Android.

Also, I thought we agreed some time ago there was no point in going to that level of versioning. That {major}.{minor}-{codename} would be sufficient.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we really need "4.4.2-kitkat"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We've certainly never used sub-versions in tags previously. I don't see a compelling reason to do so now.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I could _possibly_ see a reason if the API level changed. But presumably every device that can get 4.4 can (and will) get 4.4.2.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure, I could see that being a valid reason, too. I don't think that the API level has ever been changed on micro versions, though (and, indeed, [it has not in this case either](http://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html); API level 19 encompasses 4.4.0 - 4.4.2). Given that, I'd agree with your assessment that the 4.4.2 tag is not needed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As faer as I'd heard 4.4.1 & 4.4.2 are just minor bug-fixes for 4.4. I can't see any reason not to group all three under a 4.4 tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5AFAIK the only time subversion changes introduced a new api level was with 2.3. But this shouldn't concern use as end-user site. Only if a good reason, a user visible difference, should justify a subversion tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, you're right @Flow. It did change between 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. I do agree, though, if it's not a change a user would be impacted by or notice, then it's not important enough to warrant a separate tag.


















If there is no particluar reason for a subversion tag, which seems to be the case, then we don't need one and the two tags should get merged.

From your screenshot, it looks like you've hit the font selection problem with the Roboto font. If you install Roboto under Linux, then when a site or program asks for Roboto, it gets "Roboto Medium" (which is quite heavyweight) instead of "Roboto Regular" (which looks normal). This is a problem with how the weights are set in the font files.

Why do we (currently have) 277 questions tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tablettablet? This seems like one of the most generic and pointless tags out there.

I realise that back when tablets were new and unusual in the Android world there was even a https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/784/competition with prizes for questions tagged as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tablettablet but tablets were so rare then that this was understandable, not so any more, these days it would just cause us problems.

The roughly equivalent https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/phonephone tag is synonymised to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hardwarehardware, and we've already run clean-ups on https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1140/Manufacturer tags and actively https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260/discourage model specific tags, except where really needed.

Possible solutions:


Go through a tag cleanup exercise to pare down to just questions that really are specific problems that would only affect tablets but aren't specific enough to need tagging with the model (I'm struggling to think what they would be). Edit the wiki to note that the Tablet tag should only be used when really needed.
Synonymise https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tablettablet with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hardwarehardware (will probably need to do a tag clean-up exercise, at least on the questions with only the tablet tag if nothing else).
Leave things as they are, tablets really are a different category of questions that need identifying.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the 'Tablet' tag for?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The reason this still exists is because cleanup has never been completed!  `hardware` is another monster that probably needs cleaning up as well, I think we might want to remove `phone` as a synonym and direct people to `dialer`.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Cleanup done, 115 questions left.


















I would keep the tablet tag. But I would also have kept the phone tag, as I think that there exist questions that are only relevant for phones and tablets.

Please don't confuse this with irrelevant tags added to posts. If a question isn't phone specific, there is no need to add the phone tag. Side note: But there is also no big harm in adding it, as long as the tag doesn't occupy the spot for a more relevant one.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A tag isn't useful simply by virtue of being relevant.  `tablet` and `phone` are far too broad to be useful categories.  Nobody needs a `phone` tag on a `dialer` question, for example; the latter, better tag is obviously only applicable to phones.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree. For the same reason I would not remove the 'usb' tag from a question tagged with 'usb-tethering', as long as the more generic tag, 'usb' in this case, does not occupy a slot of a more relevant tag. It does no harm, on the opposite I think it will be a bit helpful. I enjoy exploring stackexchange sites by tags and I think someone could find the top e.g. 'tablet' questions helpful.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One more point (and here comes the idea to GAThrawn's "what they would be") are questions really specific to "dialer-less devices", e.g. including issues with apps requiring the dialer (or rather "SMS receiving functionality") for activation (WhatsApp might be one example). While questions specific to such an app could take its tag (`whatsapp-messenger` in this example), what about more generic question as e.g. "How to deal with apps *like this* in general / are there generic work-arounds"? Creating a `dialerless-hardware` tag?


















I agree with GAThrawn on "solution 1": a cleanup never hurts. I'm currently not sure whether we really should remove/synonymize the tablet tag, as I pointed out in my comment on https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1657/16575Flow's answer:


  Here comes the idea to GAThrawn's "what they would be":
  What about questions really specific to "dialer-less devices", e.g. including issues with apps requiring the dialer (or rather "SMS receiving functionality") for activation (WhatsApp might be one example)? While questions specific to such an app could take its tag (whatsapp-messenger in this example), what about more generic question as e.g. "How to deal with apps like this in general / are there generic work-arounds"?


Creating an alternative tag (dialerless-hardware) might be a fit for this special case; but there could be more we are currently unaware of, and which might not fit this pattern.

Hence my suggestion: Let's start with "solution 1" and do a cleanup. While doing that, keep these thoughts in mind, collecting ideas. Those could include:


alternative tags to be created, matching a larger group of the tablet questions
synonyms to other tags, including the "tablet" substring, pointing to existing and fitting tags
re-tagging to existing tags (automatically happens during cleanup)


Whenever an idea seems to be a possible solution, update this question (using comments when unsure, or directly using answers otherwise). Once the cleanup is done, we are wiser, and most likely able to decide on further steps (if any are still required then).

Dividable in 3 categories: 1) missing tag for the specific tablet device, 2) not specific to a single device, but tablet-specific (as opposed to phones; mostly as "non-dialing-devices", sometimes also "large-screen-devices"), 3) not sure what category to put them in.

Somehow I was on the 'active bounty' thing.

No, the URL only gives a clue when you just clicked on a tab. Then your last tab is remembered with your session.


















It seems there's an upper limit for the number of links allowed, and the error message is a bit inaccurate.

You're more likely to get help from people if you keep your questions concise and structured, rather than piling more and more information in.


















This is largely kind of a judgement call as to which flag you use on a given question. There's not a real hard and fast rule, but essentially:


"Off Topic -> Development questions are off topic..." is kind of a catch-all close reason for development questions that we aren't going to handle here. It covers actual programming, publishing questions, setting up a developer account/merchant account, trying to port Android to esoteric devices X, Y and Z, etc. If a question is clearly a development topic and you think it should be closed, this is pretty much always an appropriate flag.
"Off Topic -> Belongs on SO" is a migration feature that's basically intended to cover programming questions that are of otherwise high quality, but appear to have simply been asked on the wrong site. What makes this a judgement call is that by picking this flag, you're basically saying "Hey, this is off-topic here but I believe it would do well on Stack Overflow.


Many (honestly, probably most) dev questions asked here do not really fall into the migration category for one of a number of reasons. Often it is because the topic they're looking for help on is not actually covered on SO. Publishing questions are a good example of this - the best resource is Google's support channels, and SO usually closes questions related to publishing an app but not related to the actual programming.

Similarly, questions that are of a low-to-mediocre quality are not migrated because https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/91446/150283the golden rule of migrations is: don't migrate crap. Quality here is a little nebulous, but it could be due to very poor formatting, not having enough information (e.g "I get an error" is not specific enough for SO) or questions that are overbroad ("How do I write a music app?" is an example). Migrating a poor question is viewed as dumping more moderation work onto the receiving site, since they'll just end up closing it anyway.

Also, if you're considering flagging a post for migration because it is of decent quality, then it's often a good idea to check the user's profile to see if they've already cross-posted it to SO. A lot of new-ish users seem to do this, and migrating a duplicate is not really useful, so these will generally just be closed here.

A good rule of thumb, in my opinion: if in doubt, just pick the canned close reason. That at least gets the question into the review queue so that other people can get eyes on it as well. Plus, if someone else comes along and really thinks it should go to SO, they can still cast a migration vote even if that's not the flag you used.

(Mostly prompted by this question: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/61670/how-to-upload-images-onto-google-glass-device-and-view-themHow to upload images onto Google Glass device and view them?)

Are questions regarding Google Glass on-topic for Android Enthusiasts?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_GlassGoogle Glass at Wikipedia

It runs Android 4.0.4 (currently). "Hacks" to the firmware will require Android development, not unlike custom ROMs.

Other wearable devices, e.g., Samsung Galaxy Gear, are on-topic.

Should Google Glass be considered on-topic for Android Enthusiasts? Why or why not?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is Google Glass within this site's scope?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems like the general feeling is "yes", so can we have a note in help/on-topic to make this clear to new visitors? Also, please vote for http://android.stackexchange.com/q/61670/12442 to be reopened.


















As a preface, I've generally been a proponent of interpreting the scope of our site relatively strictly, and keeping it fairly narrow so that it doesn't lose focus from the intended goal (Android). Gadgets, I feel, ended up shutting down for a reason, and I don't want us to turn into Gadgets 2.0.

With that in mind, I think we should accept questions about Glass.

It runs Android. Although it's not using quite the same Android that other devices run, neither is Google TV, or the Galaxy Gear or even things like the Kindle Fire. As long as the questions are within the other bounds of our scope (non-development, not a shopping/purchasing question, etc), I don't really see a reason to exclude them, personally.

Now, granted, there is a significantly smaller set of people around who could answer Glass questions with any kind of authority at the moment. However, I don't think we should let that alone dissuade us. Hopefully we'll be able to attract some Glass experts over time.

Also, I suppose at some point we may need to deal with the fact that http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/52492/google-glassthere is a Google Glass proposal on Area 51. It's only in the commitment phase, though, so if we decide to allow questions about Glass here then we could likely subsume it.

No, the system is designed to take care of that itself. And user shouldn't have to deal with that. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/92006/156683Once a question changes from "On Hold" to "Closed" it may get auto deleted.

So it's either the community that takes care of deleting questions or some sort of automatic mechanism.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I thought "On Hold" replaced "Closed" many months ago ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, "On Hold" is just a temporary state. Questions but on hold will become closed eventually.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah ok fine, makes sense.


















On-hold or closed questions still have a useful purpose for the site: to serve as an example to others. Every on-hold question (for whatever reason) is an example of what kinds of question we don't want on the site. If a new visitor arrives at the site, looks at existing questions, and notices that (for example) a question about programming has been put on hold, and reads the reason, he'll learn two things: first, that we aren't Yahoo! Answers, and what happens if a question isn't appropriate for the site; second, that if he asks a programming question, it'll be put on hold too.

It's an important part of the feedback process, cultivating the community of people interested in the same topic. This is why closed questions aren't hidden from the front page (unless they have a very negative score) or deleted right away. (This is only part of the reason. Deleting them right away would stop the author improving or refining the question so it can be reopened.)

There's another side of this: often, when a voter leaves a "this is off-topic" comment, the questioner will delete their question right away, without even waiting for it to be put on hold. They're probably trying to be polite and a good netizen: deleting the question after being told it's inappropriate.

This is a shame, for two reasons. It defeats the mechanism described above, so we'll end up with more people asking questions that don't fit the site. In addition, sometimes this happens with questions that are borderline, or where the commenter has misunderstood, so the question would not be put on hold. It might even have been an asset to the site had the author not deleted it. For these reasons, I'd like to encourage close-voters to only leave an "off-topic" comment in unambiguous cases, to reduce that risk; and I'd also ask those who can't vote-to-close yet to refrain from leaving such comments, and flag the question for a more experienced user to discuss.

My bet would be a maximum of 1 out of 1.000. 99% of new users posting here don't even initiate a search to see if that question has already been asked, and might even have the answer they need. So keeping it would defeat *that* purpose – though I understand your reasoning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I know that what really happens isn't always what's meant to happen, but that's the stated reason: Mr. Spolsky explained it in a talk I went to.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme Who is Mr Spolsky ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[This guy](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/4/joel-spolsky)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme Thanks for clarification.


















I'm partly opposing https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1673/16575Dan's answer for the reasons I gave in my comment to it: I doubt there are many "new users" doing any research before they post their question. So keeping questions "as examples how you should not ask" is a waste, IMHO.

I however see a reason to not delete questions which might act as pointers to others. That's best explained using an example:
One of our most frequently asked questions is the "I forgot my pattern/password and now I'm locked out" type, which are usually closed as duplicates to https://android.stackexchange.com/q/35847/16575Can not unlock my Android device as have no internet connection?. Formerly, that question was phrased "Can not unlock my tablet...". When I find such a (new) question and want to VTC it: how to find this "master question"? Looking for "Can not unlock my tablet" makes it hard to find. It however turns out on top of the search when I type in the exact phrasing.
My point? Given a user really does a search before asking, he's unlikely to know the exact phrasing. But with more and more duplicates kept as pointers, chances to have one of them turning up on top of the search results are increasing. Opening that one then leads to the "final point of interest".

In short words:


don't delete duplicates, as they can serve as pointers to questions having the real answers
delete "spammy" questions as they are of no use at all (usually done by an automated process: those just need enough downvotes, and maybe a mod)
questions not fitting the scope of our site IMHO are of no real (practical) use, so I would tend to have them deleted as well (but no absolute here, this is a per-case decision)
questions already having useful comments or even answers should not be deleted in general (though exceptions might exist for those cases as well)

Its actually something very unique (which I haven't come across elsewhere, and maybe doesn't exist elsewhere).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why would a question which lets says has many upvotes and favourites together with lets say 3 possible answers be put on hold eventually ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Simon because the upvoters/answerers possibly tapped into the same trap as the OP? If e.g. a question is completely off-topic, that does not prevent any other user from answering/upvoting it nonetheless.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So it was a case of they got there before the Moderators...so to speak ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5One could say so, yes. And before enough other users have been there and VTC'd it, so it got "put on hold" (remember: that takes either 1 mod, or 5 non-mods).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah I see...good to know.



















"Replacing with more useful ones" IMHO makes not much sense, with 13 questions altogether. That would mean at least 5 tags with probably less than 3-4 questions each.
Seeing the tags in combinations, they seem to make sense. Browsing e.g. the gmail tag and see a question additionally tagged filter, the meaning is pretty clear. Also initiating a search for [gmail] [filter] would yield the corresponding result(s).
Most questions could probably be re-tagged (or have the filter tag simply removed).


All depends on how you look at tags, and I'm a bit torn between two thoughts: If you think about tags as "filters" (sic!), I'd say we leave is as-is. If, however, each tag should have a significant and specific meaning, there's no way for a filter tag to survive: As shown by the existing usage (and I wonder there's not also a question on screen-/display-filters), it would be much too broad – and stand-alone tags for each of the different meanings would turn out in tags with 1-4 questions each, which wouldn't be very useful either.



I'd rather say declaring filter a "generic tag", as it is currently used, and give it a corresponding description, e.g.:


  for questions involving a filtering process of any kind. This is to be used in conjunction with a descriptive tag giving it a real meaning, don't use it stand-alone.


It's tag-wiki could give some more elaborate examples then of how to use it and how not to use it.

I've noticed that bold text looks a bit funny for me, and tested the site on Safari, and there it looks OK, so it's a Chrome-only issue (could be an OSX-Chrome-only AFAIK). I'm running Mavericks with all latest updates.

Haven't encountered this on any other sites, so I'm suspecting a problem with the webfonts.

Screenshots from https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/62004/how-to-fix-google-play-store-update-error-in-android-4-0-4this page below.

Chrome 32.0.1700.77:

First it reminds me a little of the [problems Flow had with the Roboto font](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13086334#13086334), and second it looks like the Chrome example is minimally wider than the Safari one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I tried changing the fonts one by one, and the problem seems to be 'DroidSansRegular', which is used by both browsers. There's also a MIME type mismatch when loading the webfont: `Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type font/x-woff: "http://cdn.sstatic.net/android/img/droidsans-webfont.woff".`b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks a [little less funky](http://puu.sh/6zX3U.png) in Chrome on Windows, but there's still a little problem. Maybe it's chrome that don't like this MIME type, since the official MIME type for WOFF fonts is `application/font-woff`


















The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added):


  To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site.


and the "on this site" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed.

There is also a more detailed explanation of the "protected" status on https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/52764/what-is-a-protected-questionMeta Stack Exchange, for reference.

In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok got it, thanks. I was under the impression the association bonus was granted to overcome such limits by transferring the trusted status of the person, this literal limitation seems to be counterproductive to that, but at least now I know what's going on. Thank you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for removing the restriction, I just posted the answer. I know the question is a bit old but I know what its like to be stuck wanting to do something and not getting help, so if I can give this person hope to get what they need done, then why not, right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, it's not. You can offer a bounty from the bonus rep, earn 10 rep on the site, and still not be able to answer despite your having earned 10 rep on the site (the actual criterion is 110 rep if you have the bonus, even if it says that it is to earn 10 rep on the site.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@damryfbfnetsi: This is rather unintuitive, but the system is still working as designed in an instance like that. [This Meta SE question](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/238296/150283) discusses the situation. Effectively, the bounty rep is counted in full against your earned rep on the site, *even if that would result in a negative value*. So if you got the association bonus then immediately offered 50 rep bounty, the rep you had "earned" on this site would be **-49**, and you'd have to get up to 110 again (also, that 110 *is* earning 10 on the site; you "earn" 1 rep for signing up).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Now whether or not the system should be creating a "debt" of earned rep like that by dipping into the association bonus is another question entirely. I personally think it's a terribly confusing implementation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not saying that the behavior is wrong; the behavior is correct, but the **text** is wrong. The text needs to be changed to match the actual behavior.

I think our https://android.stackexchange.com/help/help-center need some minor phrasing updates. Checking e.g. the "on-topic" page:


  
  Android-independent phone questions, such as "Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?"
  


(emphasis mine), we should have "phone" replaced by "device" in most cases. Tablets are around for quite a while now, and even smart watches are running Android. Above example could lead to the conclusion that "Android independent tablet questions" are OK :)

While on this, and again with the current example, I'd even suggest checking the examples given, to make it more clear. IMHO "Android independent" doesn't only refer to carrier plans, but also to device-hardware things, like "what kind of GPS chip is built into X".

There could be a couple of reasons for this. If you have a specific question in mind that you'd like an explanation for then feel free to point it out and I (or someone else) can take a look, but off the top of my head a few possibilities would be:


If the question's last activity is attributed to Community♦ and there are no edits/modifications, then it's often (but not necessarily always) because Community♦ will periodically bump old unanswered questions to the front page, to give them additional visibility. I don't know if this is really explained anywhere, but the https://android.stackexchange.com/users/-1/communityprofile description for Community♦ does note this.
If a question is reopened, it will get bumped to the front page, but there isn't any immediately obvious activity on it. You can see the close/reopen activities in the post's revision history, though.
It's possible that someone posted a comment, spam, or other non-answer as an answer, which was then subsequently deleted. You'll still see the activity on the front page of the site, but you won't be able to see the deleted post without 10k reputation, so it will seem like some kind of phantom activity took place. If the account is a spam account, then it may be destroyed, which will attribute the activity (on the front page) to Community♦ instead of the original poster.


I may be missing some other situations here as well, but I would say that these are the most common on our site.

I had seen Community♦ pop up on some of the posts I was questioning so that likely explains it.  I guess I just have to get used to the mentality that answering old questions is OK considering that most other sites would just let the question die to avoid clutter. Thanks again!


















Should we handle the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bittorrentbittorrent tag as a tag for the app itself, or as a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/torrentstorrents (which, in my opinion, should be https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/torrenttorrent)?

This site is turning into a xda clone. Most of the questions I have observed result in a discussion. I rarely see any definite answers.

Comments are the second class citizens of Stack Exchange - discussion in comments to help clarify the meaning and intentions of a question are absolutely acceptable with the intention that once the question has been clarified, the comments get cleaned up. 

The "questions" in each instance you've linked ask for a focussed answer relating to a specific problem. Most of the answers are a bit low quality and could probably be converted into comments in the instances that you've linked, but you must keep in mind that there is no guarantee when dealing with a third party platform (like this site is - Android) that there is actually an answer to every question.

Since the Stack Exchange platform is a community driven engine, if you feel that some of the answers are not really answers, there are tools at your disposal to rectify this:


You can flag answers that are not an answer but should probably be kept (since they give good, workable advice) with a "flag for moderator attention" so that they can be converted into comments

This doesn't apply to answers that attempt to answer the question, even if they're wrong
It also doesn't apply to answers that attempt to provide a workaround

If the answer doesn't answer the question, you can flag it as "not an answer" which will place it in a queue to be reviewed and acted on

This is the correct flag to use if you feel the answer is actually a discussion
Don't use these flags if the answer is an attempt to answer the question but is ultimately wrong (that's what downvotes are for)


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree about not having an answer to every question. that's the reason I mention that this site is turning into a discussion forum rather than Q & A.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So what would you propose, making questions that don't have a answer off topic? That's certainly not the right way to approach this kind of problem. If a question doesn't have an answer - that's pretty much how it should be presented within the Stack Exchange engine - a question that doesn't have an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And just because a question doesn't have an answer at the moment doesn't mean it will never have an answer. The Waze question you linked to is a good example of this.


















If a moderator decides unilaterally to close a question, and their decision doesn't have strong support from the community, and a number of people later ask for the question to be re-opened and give sound reasons for disputing the moderator's rationale in closing it, is it considered an acceptable use of privileges for that moderator to unilaterally delete the question in order to prevent further discussion of their decision?



A while ago, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/23736/what-specific-security-risks-if-any-does-app-shield-pose?I asked a question on the Android stack exchange site which was unilaterally closed by a moderator with little explanation. 

(It being deleted obviously means it's hard to view: here's the https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210129/https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/23736/what-specific-security-risks-if-any-does-app-shield-poselatest archive.org link from Oct 2013 but unfortunately this doesn't include the latest comments).

I https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/23736/2completely reworded the question responding to the limited feedback given, and posted https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/927/how-are-questions-about-security-concerns-subjectivea question on meta asking for a clarification. Since then:


Two other people with comment privileges, finding the question while researching the topic, commented voicing their disagreement with the decision to close the question.
At least one other user (a diamond moderator on the site) https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/928/15604voted for it to be re-opened (I can't see re-open votes going back so I don't know how many other people voted to re-open).
Three people have favourited the question, hoping for it to be reopened and answered.
The question has received over a thousand views ("Popular question" badge) and at least 5 upvotes (not bad for a niche question), showing that it is a topic there is interest in.
The meta discussion showed little support or substance to the moderator's reasons for closing:


The two highest voted answers to that meta post, both from diamond moderators, say (in order of popularity) https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/930/15604(+4) that the question is good, on topic and shows a good "amount of effort and pre-question research", and that the only issue is whether a question can be closed for being difficult to answer (I'm sure the official SE line is, no, a question being difficult isn't a valid close reason so long as it's on-topic, fact-based and well-researched), and a similar answer from another diamond moderator https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/928/15604(+1) agreeing that the question is difficult, but should on balance be re-opened.
The moderator's https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/929/15604own explanation on meta couldn't possibly be the real reason they closed the original question: they criticised me for not including context and background, when the original wording at the time of their closing it was full of context and background which I had reluctantly removed in my edit thinking this context and background was what had caused the question to be closed. 
Their main other reason given for closing was to speculate that the question would be of no use to anyone else in future and so should have been "too localised", and there is clear evidence (above) that this is not true.
I commented answering each point made by the moderator who closed the question, including pointing out that his main criticism argument was not true of the question at the time he closed it, and these comments were ignored. The vote score on the moderator's meta post (currently, 0) shows that his position did not have any strong support from the community.



Just now, after the second comment disputing the moderator's decision (which notified the moderator who had closed the question), that moderator instantly deleted the question, while leaving a hostile comment that shows his motivation is personal annoyance at the discussion of his decision to close the question ("...I see no further point in continually discussing an old, useless question..."). "Useless" seems an unusual way to describe a question that has been favourited three times despite not yet having had the chance to be answered - it's clearly not a judgement that is supported by the community. 

To me, this doesn't seem like a correct use of deletion privileges. 

My understanding from the help centre is that questions are to be deleted when they risk causing harm to a site (e.g. if they are offensive or so off topic they could give the wrong impression of the scope of a site). In this case, the reason for deleting the question seems to be to prevent discussion of their decision to close it. 

Is this a valid use of deletion privileges? If not, what should happen?

I'm not saying he did or didn't do it for that reason, I'm only pointing out that you are trying to interpret a reason that is impossible to determine unless the mod chimes in.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user568458 and if your whole point to this discuss whether the mod abused his power, then you may be interested in reading [What recourse do I have if I believe a moderator has abused his/her privileges?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28867/what-recourse-do-i-have-if-i-believe-a-moderator-has-abused-his-her-privileges).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@psubsee2003 He deleted it to stop discussion which was disagreeing with him. That seems like a very subtle difference to me, but if you think it's an important difference, I've editted the paragraph and title to say he deleted the question to prevent "discussion" (which was almost entirely in disagreement), not "disagreement".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems like there wasn't any discussion after the answers had been posted—just a comment monologue from you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did answer all of the points the moderator made, yes, and showed that his main point couldn't have been part of the reason he closed the question (because it wasn't true at the time that he closed it). As you say, he didn't respond to any of these points, or any of the points made by anyone else.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You stated: "My Question is: What specific security risks (if any) does/did App Shield pose?" - For this alone, I would have voted to close this. Because without access to the app, and source, and specific expertise in security, it is not something that can be answered with facts. The question was closed OVER a year ago, and NO OTHER user voted to reopen it.


















I'll answer in general as I can't see enough information to actually judge this specific situation.

Questions that are under active discussion should not be deleted at all as this prevents the community from participating in the moderation of this question. There are exceptional cases where deleting would still be warranted, but in general such a question should remain undeleted so that the community can vote to reopen and discuss it.

But once the discussion is over, and the question has not been reopened by anyone, the situation is different. If the discussion was not convincing enough to get the community or any moderator to reopen the question, it is unlikely to be reopened at any later point.

Old, closed questions are routinely deleted by moderators, especially if they cause any kind of trouble later. The question you mentioned is now over 1.5 years old, so cleaning it up if it wasn't reopened would not be an unusual action for a moderator.

Regarding the number of votes, views and the times it was favorited, those generally don't matter much for the decision to close or delete. Popularity does not save a question from being closed if it doesn't fit the rules of the site. Favoriting is also pretty meaningless as some users use it simply to mark questions they want to find later, often also bad ones.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I added archive.org links and a link to the meta thread. You say "Old, closed questions are routinely deleted by moderators, especially if they cause any kind of trouble later" - the "trouble" in this case was a user asking for the question to be re-opened. Is it reasonable to view comments asking for re-opening as "trouble" warranting deletion? It's worth noting that the meta thread was inconclusive, and the view of the moderator who closed the question received little support and had criticisms which were unanswered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The "trouble" part is optional, being an old question that is closed and that has no special reason to remain undeleted is enough to warrant deletion. But often they are only deleted when a mod is drawn there by a flag or anything else. And comments asking for reopening of a question 1.5 years later seem somewhat pointless to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5the right approach to questions involved in heated meta discussion is probably to [lock for content dispute](http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/a/6195/31260 "example discussed here"), to prevent [meta effect](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/204311/165773)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`It's worth noting that the meta thread was inconclusive, and the view of the moderator who closed the question received little support and had criticisms which were unanswered.` I think this was wrong, not answering the criticism mod received. Also, having a `diamond` before your name adds lot of responsibility, other then just extra work. They have to be held more answerable for every action they take, and a `diamond` mod should know this. "If criticism was there, answers or justifications were must."b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MadScientist Why do you say "comments asking for reopening of a question 1.5 years later seem somewhat pointless to me"? Some of the best answers I've seen on SE have been posted 1+ year after the question was asked, by someone who found the question while researching the topic. Answering old questions is encouraged (e.g. with the necromancer badge).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user568458 If the question wasn't reopened in a short time after it was closed and discussed on meta, it is very unlikely to ever be reopened. Old questions simply don't get enough attention to be reopened in the typical cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So essentially: moderators *can* delete old closed questions for any reason (including to silence calls for the question to be re-opened), because community low attention or apathy means that old questions seldom actually get re-opened anyway (regardless of the strength of any case that they should be)? *(Side note: two of the three meta posts cited the fact that there didn't seem to be much interest in the question to justify keeping it closed despite it not actually breaching the rules of the site: it didn't become apparent that there was interest in it until later)*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user568458 If the community didn't reopen when there was a meta discussion about it, there doesn't seem to be as much consensus that it is a good question as you implied. A meta discussion is the best chance to get a question reopened, if that isn't enough the question likely shouldn't be reopened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So in short the answer is: apathy and inertia rule SE, not rules?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user568458 You're twisting what I said. If you can't convince enough users that the closure was in error directly after it happened, then your case is not as strong as you thought and the question was likely closed correctly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not twisting, pointing out a consequence. It's [a known problem that reaching the reopen vote threshold is difficult on non-SO SE](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/124100/) and the [answer](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/124123/178621) is basically that it's a popularity contest, and you need to actively *make* people take an interest ("you have to rally support to obtain enough interested people"). Not easy for a niche question, or where people are reluctant to disagree with a high-rep moderator. It's a known, discussed problem.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To add context, the question is "closed as not constructive by Matthew Read♦ Jun 2 '12 at 20:40"; and was deleted yesterday. The question is NOT under active discussion, and in my opinion, even though the original close vote may be in dispute at that time, the moderator's decision to delete it more than a year later is correct. If you wish, you can create a new question, **after taking into account** what closed the original question in the first place.


















The question was closed in June 2012. It's asking about why a particular app was pulled from the Google Play Store and specifically what security issues did it raise.

As seen in the https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/927/how-are-questions-about-security-concerns-subjectiveMeta discussion about it, two other users (current Android Enthusiasts Community Moderators) weigh in with their thoughts. In essence: Nobody can answer with authority except perhaps the author of the app and/or the Google personnel who pulled it from the Play Store. Unless someone can reverse engineer the app and analyze it, any answers would just be speculation.

In all the time it was closed, it was never re-opened. Meaning there was really no great push from the community to get the question an answer. Oh, it was edited for grammar a bit, but that's all. And so it has lain fallow for 2½ years.

Earlier today someone posted a comment asking why the question was "Non Constructive". (I'll not re-hash why "Non Constructive" was removed as a Close reason in the latest redesign of the Close voting system.) I don't want to speculate on the Moderator's mindset, but most likely the @alert in the comment just brought him back to this old, closed question and, seeing no hope of it ever being answered, deleted it.

Since the Moderator who deleted it is the one who unilaterally closed it initially, and was being questioned in the comments, it probably would have been better for a different Moderator to step in and act so as to reduce any questions of impropriety.

All that said, I would have voted to delete it, and I'm just a high-reputation user at Android Enthusiasts. It's virtually impossible to get any facts except what's already been reported (and would be findable by a quick web search) and so the question is inviting speculation. Discussion. Not a good fit for Stack Exchange.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That must have been before he was a moderator, then, because otherwise it would have been re-opened.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You should correct "two other users... weigh in with their thoughts agreeing with the closure", which isn't true. It's very unusual to close a question based on speculation about likely answers and answerers (rather than the content of the question). Opinion was divided about whether a question can be closed for being valid but difficult to answer: one in favour of closing, one in favour of re-opening, and one unsure simply voicing "one concern I have with questions of this nature".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user568458 Yes, and the answer advocating closure is the one that got way more upvotes than the others, indicating that *that* is the decision that the community supports more.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Servy No, the answer advocating closure (Matthew Read's) had the least votes (0, when this question was posted). The answer with the most upvotes (eldarerathis's, +4) was the answer that was undecided - it discussed the case for and against, and ended by raising a "`related and slightly more general question`".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user568458 I read that answer as indicating that closure is appropriate.  He spends the vast majority of the answer explaining why the question is unlikely to generate quality answers, and will tend to be unanswerable.  He shows a bit of sympathy towards you, sure, but it still seems clear to me that he feels the question should be closed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I too would have voted to close and delete it for the same reasons that have been stated. It is all speculation and virtually none of it would be fact.


















I noticed just now that we have a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cm11cm11 tag, which was created for a question specifically about CyanogenMod 11 as opposed to another version. It is currently very small, whereas https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cyanogenmodcyanogenmod has ~800 questions.

My first instinct was to simply merge and synonymize this with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cyanogenmodcyanogenmod, but giving it a second thought, I felt this could be a valuable discussion for the community-at-large.

If we do want to keep version-specific CM tags, I think they should be similar to our other naming conventions, and be fully spelled out (e.g. cyanogenmod-11 instead of cm11).

One concern I have is that having version-specific tags will essentially make https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cyanogenmodcyanogenmod useless/obsolete. It really shouldn't be kept around if there's a more specific tag available, and double-tagging everything would seem kind of silly. This might also make it harder to follow CyanogenMod questions, though, since you'd have to favorite a number of tags instead of just one. I can also see value in knowing which specific version of CM a given question is about, however, since features can change from version to version quite significantly.

So, is there enough value in having version-specific CyanogenMod tags to warrant keeping them around? Would they be more troublesome than helpful?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we have version-specific CyanogenMod tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not into the rooting/modding scene, so I don't really have any skin in the game either way. If there are version-specific tags, though, please do keep them to `cyanogenmod-X` format, so I can put `cyanogenmod*` in my ignore list.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Am not 100% sure if this is ideal, as there's a dedicated forum and wiki for Cyanogenmod, should we be directing them there as their support base is quite large?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In some cases where I am able to help with CM questions, I answer them. But if I can't, I would redirect them to the CM forum, as suggested by @t0mm13b. [However, I've junked CM lately as it's given me nothing but problems!]b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel that cyanogenmod tag + android version would be specific enough to indicate what version of CM. We already have android specific versions. Make a cm specific version, which changes with android versions already, would be redundant. I recently suggested we merge the cm11 tag with cm tag. Sorry no link, im on mobile app and on the train, ill link it later.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Curious, are the [tag:cm11]/[tag:cyanogenmod-11] tags going to be merged in to [tag:cyanogenmod]? especially since cm12 is gaining more devices and we will probably start seeing tags for that as well.

So, Google has announced http://developer.android.com/wear/index.htmlAndroid Wear this week.

For those who don't know/don't have the time to read: it is a smartwatch but this one should be compatible with ALL Android powered phone and is simply a shortcut for notifications/events from your phone (it is paired trough an application downloaded from the Play Store). Having a Android Wear without a (Android?) phone to pair with is useless.

So, when it will be released, will we accept questions about Android Wear on this Stack Exchange?

I think most savvy users already know better than to run software that's only available as a download from a file-sharing site such as Mediafire, so TBH I wouldn't include such a link at all. If you have to link to an official ROM, then link to the source on the manufacturer's site or equivalent. If you have to link to some other software, link to the distributor's website, or to the relevant XDA Developers page. That has several advantages. 


Users can have some confidence about what software they're downloading, and whether it's been tampered with or contains malware
On a site like XDA Developers, people discuss the software in question, so visitors can find out more information, and whether the software can be relied on, by looking at other people's comments there.
If the distribution method of the software changes, the original page will update their links, so visitors can still get the file without anything on this site having to change.


The idea of avoiding link-only answers isn't only to avoid broken links: that reason's quoted most because it's easier to understand. The other reason is that a link-only answer doesn't tell the user what to expect at the other end. Linking to some random file on Mediafire has just the same problem: I don't know whether I'm getting genuine, working software, or a trojan. Linking to an official source or another reputable site lets me know what to expect, making your answer more useful to everyone.

I am referring to https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/65839/revisionsthis edit to my answer by a moderator. The edit has removed many useful info from the post. Of course I've just copied and pasted most of my answer from the source which I had mentioned there, but all of the info was required.  

I wouldn't care about that and would have reverted the edit, but since it was by a moderator, I would like to ask if the edits should remove such info or not?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Isn't this an invalid edit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What specific useful information do you feel the edit removed? The reason I combined the first list with the second was that it was very redundant and kind of overly verbose. Portions of the requirements could be succinctly said in a sentence instead of a list ("You need Windows and your phone needs to be charged"). A couple of steps in the second list simply said things like "Do what the list says above". I didn't see the point in that, but the information is still there, just not in the same exact order. Admittedly, another reason was to help mitigate potential copyright issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you're lucky eldarerathis chose to spend his time editing your post instead of just deleting it. You can't just paste other people's work wholesale: you'll get the site into trouble.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did not think about copyright issue and I think if I've mentioned the source it should be sufficient. Anyways my point here is to just understand the invalid edits properly. I have no problem in admitting that the new answer looks better. But is it allowed to modify the answer to remove points you think are redundant or not required. I thought the process was to ask the op to correct it themselves in comments. I just need answer to fulfill my curiosity :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It looks like a good edit to me. "Redundant" means that it's not necessary. Removing redundant information won't change the meaning of a post.


















Just so you have an answer: Dan and Al are correct.  Unfortunately, simply linking the source isn't enough any more than a movie torrent is legal if you list the publisher's name.

Anything repeated or not useful is certainly game for removal by an edit.  We have edits much for that reason — fixing typos and such is nice, but substantial edits are even better.  Removing useful information is bad, but you seem to be agreed now that that did not in fact happen.

There's no such thing as "WiFi charging". Apps that purport to do this are hoaxes.

If you're asking about wireless charging that might be a different matter, as there are a few devices that use the technology and it looks to become even more common. (The new Motorola 360 watch is rumored to use wireless charging.)

But then, you're asking about a company who might be doing something in this arena and if you can get into their beta program. That's off-topic here. Go ask them.

Frankly, I think the question was closed for the wrong reason, but it should be closed.

If you have a specific question about an issue with wireless charging on your Android device, by all means add it. But the question you ask is either vague and speculative or not really about Android and is likely to be outdated and useless relatively quickly.

Since the new phrasing of the question is better, I'll reopen the question. I still fear that the answers will become obsolete quickly, since all solutions depend on specific apps, but at least you'll get some solutions.

I tried to sign up here and got a message in a yellow field informing me about something, but the message in the yellow field was impossible to read. The first time I gave up.

Today I had the idea to sign up via Google, and it worked.

I think this problem should be checked. Small white script in a yellow field drowns and becomes illegible.



Edit by Izzy:

Shywim posted a screenshot in the comments which explains what is meant:

I've just started with Android (just bought my first smartphone) and I would like to know answers to the questions that I'm sure should me already answered on any Android resource:


How do I revert the system back to original state? (asked https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/67169/how-to-restore-stock-firmware-on-htc-one-minispecific version for my http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_one_mini-5505.phpHTC One mini, but didn't receive a full answer) Maybe I'd better ask how to backup and restore the system?
How do I root the phone? (and revert the changes back, for completeness' sake)
How do I flash a custom ROM?


I am surprised that I cannot see these generic questions on Android StackExchange. Should I ask them, or is there anything wrong with these questions?

Guest accounts are just like any other account, they stay until you delete it yourself, or merge it into another account. The main disadvantage of a guest account is that it is https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/44562/133427only associated to you by a temporary cookie. As you don't have an actual login and password, there's no way to log into it from another PC or device, and if the cookie expires then there's no way to access that account again.

If you have an existing guest account that you've used to post a question or answer and you'd like it merged into your https://android.stackexchange.com/help/why-registernew registered account, see this help page: https://android.stackexchange.com/help/merging-accountsI accidentally created two accounts; how do I merge them?

I'm seeing different numbers for the 'featured' questions depending on what page I'm on.
If I'm on the main page the https://android.stackexchange.com/?tab=featuredfeatured link shows (5)



But if i click on it I only see 3 questions, although it stills shows (5) in the tab.



If I'm within the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=featuredQuestions section it shows correctly (3).

We already discussed that in chat a few days ago. While having no definite answer, our "guessed conclusions" are:


it's the number of overall items in queue
probably for reasons of cost, the ones irrelevant to the user are not filtered out


No idea what should have led to the current situation. While some of us observed something similar in the past (most obvious: if you suggest an edit which has to be approved, this was shown as "pending" though you certainly couldn't approve it yourself), it currently seems to be at a peak. I permanently have 20+ items shown in the "Collider™" (top toolbar), and when clicking it usually get an (almost) empty queue shown.



This is a SE-wide thingy. I see the very same on SoftRecs. So if you're interested in a definite answer/solution, your question should probably go to https://meta.stackexchange.com/Meta-SE. Or just pick the relevant question out there:

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/230742/notification-for-reviews-shows-way-too-muchNotification for reviews shows way too much:


  This indicator is shown only to moderators and users who've https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-toolsgained access to the moderator tools
  […]
  you're being given a birds-eye view of the actual state of review.


So this confirms what we've already guessed: it is the number of overall items in queue. And it obviously is not seen as a bug, but as a feature …
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I bet it's all about caching.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead I wouldn't be too sure with that. It updated correspondingly while I worked the queue (i.e. number decreased when I was #5 to VTC, approved an edit, etc.), which is either fake-caching, or no caching involved I'd say.


















I don't think we should create a tag for each and every app around – that's not the purpose of tags. IMHO for that new Opera browser, the more generic opera-mobile tag should be OK. You can still fine-tune with your question phrasing which variant you're using.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, but we still have Opera Mini and Opera Mobile. We could merge them into one generic Opera tag, or use a generic browser tag? I'm using opera-mobile now anyway, so I guess my questions are OK.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm for merging. Both tags together have 30 questions (assumed none of them carries both tags already, which would make that number even lower). I will set up a corresponding Meta request, and link here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Done, see: [Merge opera-mini into opera-mobile](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/1751/16575)


















As just pointed out by https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1749/16575Add separate Opera tag for the new Opera browser, we currently have two Opera tags:


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/opera-miniopera-mini × 17
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/opera-mobileopera-mobile × 13


I not only see no good reason in creating a third Opera-tag, but rather suggest to merge the two. Target should be opera-mobile (for all "mobile Opera browsers" that's the most intuitive one). Optionally, opera-mini could be kept as synonym (to avoid having it re-created).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge opera-mini into opera-mobileb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why not just opera (as the site implies Android). The other 2 can be synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know that I agree with this. The question that [sparked that first Meta post](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/69064/set-font-size-in-opera) itself illustrates a difference between Opera Mini and the new Opera browser. Tagging them generically seems like it could cause confusion. The apps are very similar, certainly, but not the same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis I still don't think it's advisable to create tags for each and every app around. The count of questions using those tags to me are indicators of, how to put it, "not that high importance". Differences (aka "fine-tuning") could be pointed out literally in the question text instead. Tags shouldn't enable you to write your problem without text :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see no reason why tags should *not* be created per-app.  They're not a finite resource, at least not with a limit were going to run into.  You should provide some rationale here Izzy.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead my rationale is that most questions and their answers will be very likely to fit all variants. So finding your information using a search with tags is easier if they are "grouped" – especially if each tag will only be applied to a few questions, as we see in this example. Would it be different (e.g. each tag holding 100+ questions), I had not made this proposal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say that searching "opera" is easy enough if you want to cover all variants.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead that would give you all posts *mentioning* Opera (i.e. also those writing e.g. "looks fine with Opera"), which might not be what's intended. But OK, it was just a suggestion; if I'm the only one on this side of the river, I take a boat and come over to join you :) In other words: Feel free to reject if that's what the majority feels right.


















I don't think there is a button to shrink the image however, you can modify the url to use a smaller image for images hosted at imgur.com. Simply add a m for medium or s for small to the file name like so:

Google released a developer preview of Android "L" Wednesday at their I/O conference. Is that developer preview on topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions regarding the Android L developer preview on topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the questions are from an end user perspective, perhaps ... a build for developers tends to preclude that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So far we've accepted questions about ART, which has been a developer preview (and still is until L proper is released), so logically it seems we have to. But questioners need to expect "don't use the developer preview then" as an answer to some questions.


















I would say they are on-topic. However...


The universe of people who could know the answer is rather small. There may not be anybody here who can answer your question.
It is a preview, so a lot of things are going to change. A problem you ask about today may get fixed in the released version, or even in a later review build. Stack Exchange is about the "long tail". That is, for the people who come after who have the same problem the Asker did. A question (and its answers) for a problem that no one can ever have any more is of no use.
And, of course, developer (programming) questions are off-topic regardless of OS version.

I'd imagine a lot of answers now will be "It's a bug" with a very early build.


















Many questions come to this site for recommendations for Android applications that matches a specified need. Usually these questions for recommendations are closed as "too localized" because they meet the requirements of a single person rather than the Android community at large. There is, however, a software recommendation site on the Stack Exchange network: http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.comhttp://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com. This site is not listed on the page that allows questions to be recommended to other Stack Exchange sites.

There's only one chat site for all of Stack Exchange, so you only need to have 20 rep on any SE site to use chat.

The rep limit for chat is more to discourage "smurf" accounts (i.e. established users making a second account just to engage in disruptive behaviour) and spam, rather than to limit chat to knowledgeable users, so this makes sense even if it was an accident of how chat works.

We will miss that "character" next to your avatar – but hopefully do not have to miss you entirely!


















Thanks. I was just about to create a "I retired as moderator" post, but Matthew was faster.

https://android.stackexchange.com/electionIt was fun being a moderator for this site for nearly 2 years. I can tell that it's true that one downside of being an mod is that you get to see all the low quality posts (and have to handle them), which is tiresome somehow. But on the other hand we have a site with good quality content and I think the community around it is great. http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25/androidJust join the Android Enthusiasts chat if you don't believe me. :)

I'll remain around on Android Enthusiasts.

The answers concerning unbricking are substantially different depending on http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1133590whether it is a hard-brick/coma or a soft-brick.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/20696/google-io-galaxy-tab-10-1-refuses-to-power-on-any-hope-of-revivalAn example of a possible hard-brick or coma vs https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/23359/galaxy-tab-p7500-wont-bootan example of a soft-brick.

But we have only a single tag unbricking for both.

It would be more convenient to search for answers if the tag was split: hard-unbricking vs soft-unbricking.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5split "unbricking" tag: hard-bricked vs soft-bricked devicesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do you define hard-brick and soft-brick?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Flow something like: soft brick -- it powers on, but the boot process never succeeds; hard-brick or coma -- there are no signs that the device is active, it doesn't power on at all. Seen this explanation at xda-developers, and it is really a very substantial difference inside what people call "brick". Like the quooted text at http://www.xda-developers.com/android/explaining-and-advancing-the-unbrickable-mod/ I've found it: I read it at http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1133590


















It would be more convenient to search for answers if the tag were split... and it were always used correctly. But most of our visitors have no idea of the difference. Even the existing tag isn't always used appropriately, and I don't think introducing new, finer granularities is going to help that. For this reason, I don't believe that the split you suggest would actually help.

Trouble is, we might miss those, too. Still, a cleanup never hurts, so for the part where it doesn't match at all, it could be removed entirely.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I am generally of the opinion that if only an expert knows whether a tag is relevant or not, we're just setting up the expert users for a lot of extra work for little real benefit. That's an especially big problem for a site like ours with a low ratio of experts to novices.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm afraid I agree with Dan, here.


















What is the difference between Stack Overflow and android.stackexchange.com?

When should Android questions in SO be directed to android.stackexchange.com?

Is this site for Java/XML programming around Android? Or more about the internal structure / hardware, etc?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What kind of enthusiasm?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure why the downvote. This is a perfectly acceptable question for our meta. (Although I expect it's a duplicate and is answered quite readily by reading the Help Center.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also: http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/1239/how-to-stop-users-from-posting-development-questions-on-android-enthusiasts?rq=1


















The answer to your first question is found in the https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp: it's for questions faced by Android users, not for questions about developing and publishing apps or ROMs. Programming questions should go on Stack Overflow instead. Problems with development tools (such as adb), and questions about Android internals are fine on this site provided the answer is useful or interesting to end-users. For example, questions about using adb backup to back up your device are on-topic, but questions about automating something that's only useful for testing apps are not.

The same distinction applies to hardware questions. We've some questions about using Android with certain peripherals, and about replacing broken screens or fixing other hardware problems that end users are likely to face. But questions about how to port Android to your favourite dev board, or which pins on a camera module are which, just don't fit here.

As for directing questions here, either by migration or by making a suggestion to a questioner, the answer is the same as any SE site. If you're not an active user of a site, don't migrate a question to that site. If you suspect a question might be suitable for migration, pop into chat and ask the moderators. Migrating a question to a site where it's immediately closed (or telling a person to ask on another site where it's immediately closed) just drives away new users with bureaucracy.

After going through this https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1239/how-to-stop-users-from-posting-development-questions-on-android-enthusiastspost thoroughly I am asking for a feature which may be valid/invalid.(based on the moderator to accept it)

I prefer something more or less the ability to post a question should be unlocked only on the user receiving the Informed Badge. 

As the user is forced to read the about page it can indirectly reduce the clutter from the user side as he/she will not post any coding/development related on AE .



I have also observed that many first timers posting the question with code or relating to development always lag the informed badge so I suggest to have this feature.
If anyone has any other valid method to avoid this then please feel free to suggest.

Simply flagging the post for the moderator as off the topic is not a better option as we have to avoid code/development related posts on AE for the future as well.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Feature request to avoid code on AE from novice usersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I am extremely interested in combating this, I fear that clueless people will simply scroll through the About page to get the badge, refusing to read.  And new users asking good questions will have this stumbling block in their way -- the more barriers to using a site, even a minor one like this, the more users simply don't bother and go elsewhere.


















The official way to "disable" an app (usually https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bloatwarebloatware or other https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/system-appssystem-apps) was only introduced with Android 4.0. Before that, apps could be "frozen" with e.g. Titanium Backup on rooted devices. Users which started with Android 4.0 or higher thus might never have been confronted with the "freeze" term, and consequentially missing the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/freeze-appfreeze-app – as you can see e.g. with https://android.stackexchange.com/q/75868/16575How can I permanently disable (not uninstall) a stock app?.

Hence my question: Should we introduce https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/disable-appdisable-app as synonym to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/freeze-appfreeze-app, to give people starting to type "disable" a chance to find the correct tag?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we introduce 'disable-app' as synonym to 'freeze-app'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is a good idea. Should we go one further, and make [tag:disable-app] the canonical one (since this is now the standard) and convert [tag:freeze-app] into a synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fine with me as well – and I agree, that would be logical. I just don't know if that "workflow" is implemented for our mods, or if it would only be possible "with complications" not worth the trouble ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As 10 days passed, and this got only positive feedback as far as I can see: What's stopping us from at least creating the synonym?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I second this motion.


















So, I want to ask about the name of the Android mascot.  Of course, this has nothing to do with anything but the marketing of the operating system/hardware.  

But I can't find any relevant tags.  You all know that the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/androidandroid tag is banned (for probably good reason).  I've tried several alternatives that would apply for my question, e.g., marketing.  But there isn't anything that nearly applies.

I guess this is partly related to the fact that marketing questions are not on topic, but this is (I think) not that kind of marketing question.  I want to know a facet of how Google markets Android, not how I can market my Android app.  The help center doesn't differentiate between those kinds.

So I'm coming to you to ask... Is this question off topic?  If not, what tag(s) should/could I use? And to those who answer my original question in the comments, should I bother asking on the main site since you just gave me an answer?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The tags tell me I'm polluting the main site, but I don't think that's correct (title ver. 3)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, child metas, how rarely you are visited :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First result of [this query](https://www.google.com/search?q=name+of+android+robot) is [this result](http://www.intomobile.com/2009/02/17/so-what-is-the-name-of-the-google-android-robot-anyway/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlE.: You think I didn't search first?  FYI, if you read that uninformative article, it gives *multiple* names.  None of which is cited as the "official" name.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, guess what? That's about the extent of the public information that's out there about the name of the Android mascot, if it does have a name. Unless someone from Google wanders in to answer your proposed question, it's essentially unanswerable and will simply invite guesses and speculation. So it'll be off-topic that way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlE.: You're probably right.


















I don't think your question is on-topic here.

The name of the Android mascot has nothing to do with how Android works. It's not a difficulty you're having with an app, or how to root a specific model of phone, or how to recover a deleted photo.

It's idle curiosity about how Google is marketing the OS.

Would questions about the clydesdales be on-topic for http://beer.stackexchange.comhttp://beer.stackexchange.com?

How about "why is there a bite out of the apple" at http://apple.stackexchange.comAsk Different?

There may be places where this question would be welcome, but not here.

Not everything on the site has to be troubleshooting.


















I would say not.  Hardware modding doesn't really have anything to do with Android the platform, and would generally be generically about cell hardware than specifically Android hardware.  It also doesn't match the expertise of most of our users.

From its topic description, https://electronics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicthe Electrical Engineering SE might be host to a subset of such questions.

The difference in rep-points is 15, which suggests someone might have accepted one of your answers before you checked first time (46), and decided otherwise during the same day (46-15=31). As that makes 15-15 on the same day, it's not shown as one action canceled out the other "immediately".

I often see questions in the close queue that people have VTC'ed or flagged as "unclear what you're asking" without leaving a comment. I've adopted my own policy about this, and I'd like to see more people do the same, to help new users, non-native speakers, and others who have trouble writing clear questions on the site.

The policy is this: I won't VTC a question as "unclear what you're asking" without leaving a comment asking the user to clarify or add more information.

We get a lot of troubleshooting questions on this site, and often they don't contain all the necessary information: they're about manufacturer apps but the questioner doesn't say what phone he has; they're about behaviour that's different in different Android versions, but the questioner doesn't say which version he's using. In cases where there's so much missing information that nobody could reasonably hope to answer the question, because even if they've seen exactly the same problem before, they wouldn't recognise it from the question, then voting to close as "unclear" is entirely appropriate. This adds a note to the question asking for more information.

But in this case, it's also unclear what we're asking. "Please add further details to your question... but we're not going to tell you what details." This doesn't help the questioner at all. If he knew he needed to say what phone he has, or which particular step of a process went wrong, or what the actual behaviour was (instead of "doesn't work"), then he'd have included that information in the first place. We can only arrive at a useful question by telling the questioner what he needs to do.

The same applies to other kinds of "unclear what you're asking". If it's unclear because it's badly written or the English doesn't make sense, it's courteous to explain what the problem is, as precisely as possible. If it's unclear because there's no question asked, it may be a simple oversight, or it may be that it's a new user who doesn't understand the Q&A format. Either way, the only way to end up with an answerable question is to say what's wrong, and what the questioner needs to do to fix it. The default "unclear what you're asking" banner is generic and vague, and doesn't tell the questioner what's wrong with his question in particular.

For this reason, I'm asking for everyone on the site to post a comment before VTC'ing a question as "unclear what you're asking". Out of all the close reasons, it's the least self-explanatory. If we do this well, and the questioner is eagerly looking out for responses, it may be that the question can be fixed before it is even closed, which is ideal.

Currently, it's


  General discussion for android.stackexchange.com


which is accurate but a bit... flat. I think it could be improved in two ways:


It could be more inviting. The description is our opportunity to really sell the room, get our target audience interested, make them realise how fun we are and the interesting discussions we have. Right now I'm afraid it's just telling people exactly how fun we are.
It could set the topic better. Just like the main site, we get programmers asking programming questions every so often. The thing is, most of these people know that ASE isn't for them: they come in and post a link to their question on SO, because they've not understood that SO has its own chat system on chat.stackoverflow.com. I've heard rumours that the two chat servers will be unified Real Soon Now, but as a programmer myself I know better than to pin my hopes on vapourware. I think a description that described the topic itself, not just a link to the site, would help visitors to realise that it isn't the right place to get more attention for their questions on SO.


I think the electronic engineering room has a good description, which is open and friendly but still focuses on the topic and sets an ethos for the room.

Yes, that's how the reputation system works. Downvotes on questions are "free". Downvotes on answers will deduct one reputation from the person who cast the vote.

You can find this information in the https://android.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputationHelp Center article "What is reputation?"


  You lose reputation when:
  
  
  your question is voted down: −2 
  your answer is voted down: −2 
  you vote  down an answer: −1 
  you place a bounty on a question: −full bounty amount 
  one of your posts receives 6 spam or offensive flags:−100
  


It's noted in the Help Center article regarding the https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-downvote down privilege, under the heading "What happens when I vote down?" as well. The latter page also includes a link to http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/a blog post which explains why downvotes on questions no longer cost any rep on the voter's side.

The general reasoning is that deducting rep from the voter helps to regulate downvotes a bit, by causing people to think about whether or not the quality of the answer is worth the small ding to their own rep. Conversely, question votes are free because questions tend to receive fewer votes in general, but pushing poor questions to the bottom of the site is important to keeping the site healthy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the link to the help article and the explanation.  I appreciate it!


















One more argument in addition to https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1797/16575eldarerathis' answer: Downvotes are not intended to punish the poster, but to cause him to improve his post. If he does, you can take back your downvote (and get your rep back).

If it was a real bad post, and receives enough downvotes (or attention from our mods/high-reppers [not "high rappers" :)]), the post gets deleted. In such a case, all "down-voters" get their "lost rep" back as well – provided the deletion happens in a given time-frame. I don't remember the exact numbers here; but if the post only gets deleted a year later, the rep stays lost.

Remains the question: Does it make sense to down-vote a post of a user just having 1 rep? He won't see (or feel) that. You only can lose rep if you've got some (which as down-voter, you have). But see previous paragraph: Given enough down-votes, a special user called "Community" (which even has mod status) automatically deletes such a post – and once more, you regain your "lost rep". Thus it makes pretty much sense for e.g. spam and offending posts, to speed up their "demise".

The bottom padding of the open bounty notification seems to be a bit off to me. If there are no comments, the "add a comment" link overlaps with the bounty div, especially on hover. WIth comments it seems to be barely OK. At the moment you can see an example here: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/79230What is the default chinese font on Android?

Here's a screenshot:


Tested with OSX Chrome 36.0.1985.125 and Safari 7.0.5

I just saw we've got another dupe here: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmod-recoveryclockworkmod-recovery (× 9) and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmodclockworkmod (× 236). I don't think we need them both. The latter has a decent tag-wiki already, and is the more frequently used one. Hence I suggest to merge the former into the latter. Not sure we need to make it a synonym, but that might prevent it from being re-created – so I've already marked it accordingly.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Merge 'clockworkmod-recovery' into 'clockworkmod'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`clockworkmod-recovery` actually seems like the better master tag to me. It's more specific, and "ClockworkMod" could also refer to the entity (Koush) that creates various apps (search for apps made by ClockworkMod [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=ClockworkMod), for example).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would tend to agree. I can't see a reason why we should have questions about "ClockworkMod" the entity, so it makes sense to me that `clockworkmod-recovery` is the master tag, with `clockworkmod` as a synonym.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That would then mean to also rename the 'twrp' tag. I don't know what that would mean to all the places referring there via `[tag:clockworkmod]` and `[tag:twrp]` (guess I'm not the only one using these macros in answers and tag wikis). So if you decide to go that way, please ensure that the original tags at least remain as synonyms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't really see the corollary there, to be honest. "TeamWin" is the entity, and "TeamWin Recovery Project" (TWRP) is the recovery. That's basically the same situation that I was trying to point out here. If we had a `teamwin` tag then I would say it should be merged with `twrp` (or `teamwin-recovery` or something), but we don't, because nobody is asking questions about the *entity*, TeamWin.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And synonymizing them should handle any inbound links, AFAIK. They'll just redirect to the master's page. I'd make sure the tag wiki was brought over to the new master tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, in this case I'm fine with both approaches ;) I just prefer "short tags" over "long names" (no, I better don't ask for a `cwm` synonym #D) – but that's covered as well as long as both stay, no matter which one becomes the synonym :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just FYI: the tag merge tool appears to be broken at the moment. When the SE team gets that sorted out I'll do the merge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Just a ping (as a non-mod I cannot check): Is the merge tool working again, so this task could be completed? As our mods rarely appear in chat, I unfortunately cannot ask there :(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Still not working. I created a bug report on this Meta site: [Attempting to merge tags results in an error page](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/1809)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis thanks! Upvoted it to give it some more weight. Good idea to link it here; when checking back next time, before "sending out pings" I can simply check there whether the problem still exists first.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Looks like you can mark this one "completed"? :) Thanks a lot for your efforts!


















The following question received an answer more than three years ago.  It was a fine answer at the time, but I can't help but wonder if it could be improved on now.  Is there a good way to incentivize new answers?

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1156/how-can-i-customize-the-list-of-services-that-pops-up-when-i-choose-to-share-sHow can I customize the list of services that pops up when I choose to "share" something in an app?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can we attract new solutions to old questions that have already been answered?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See below. Or you draw attention by asking on Meta – answer posted ;)


















You could https://android.stackexchange.com/help/bountyoffer a bounty. Two of the possible http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/bounty-reasons-and-post-notices/canned reasons seem applicable, I would think:


  Current answers are outdated
  The current answer(s) are out-of-date and require revision given recent changes.


Or simply:


  Draw attention
  This question has not received enough attention.


Starting a bounty will put the question on the "featured" questions tab for the duration, and the rep bonus tends to be a good incentive as well.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I only have 116 points here; is there another good way to do this that won't kill off some of my basic privileges? I can offer minimum bounty without losing anything important, so that is an option (do you think 50 points is enough to attract attention here?), but 100 points will take away my ability to, say, leave comments. I don't care about the points themselves, just the privileges, since I'm on the extreme low end.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The only other decent option would be to perform some kind of edit to update the question with additional detail/clarity. That would bump it back to the top of the active list, at least. Just be sure that any editing provides improvement to the content (i.e. don't add whitespace or something just to bump it).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I actually did just that, and the post got a great new answer. However [the edit was rejected](http://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/79767). I understand why a reviewer would reject at a glance, but I disagree with the reject and believe I have solid reasons; also I believe the edit didn't really change the question. Would you be willing to make the edit, if you think it's valid? I was going to post about it on meta but I thought I'd ask you about it here first, since there's some context in these comments.


















I've been periodically attempting to merge two tags over the past ~3 weeks - as per the discussion in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1805/merge-clockworkmod-recovery-into-clockworkmodthis Meta question - but have been unable to do so. The first few steps of the merge process work alright: I can select the two tags, and the merge preview gets pulled up correctly, but when I hit the button to actually perform the merge, I get kicked out to the https://android.stackexchange.com/errorSomething Bad HappenedTM page.

If relevant, the specific tags I'm attempting to merge are https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmodclockworkmod and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmod-recoveryclockworkmod-recovery, with the former being set as a synonym of the latter.

Additional information that appears to possibly be relevant: there was a synonym suggestion awaiting approval that was going to map https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmod-recoveryclockworkmod-recovery to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmodclockworkmod. This is the opposite of the merge we were trying to perform, so I'm suspecting that it was causing the system to bomb out because it couldn't reconcile the attempted merge with the synonym suggestion. I was able to complete the merge by doing the following:


Went into the synonym suggestions and clicked "swap" to reverse the direction of the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmod-recoveryclockworkmod-recovery→https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/clockworkmodclockworkmod synonym suggestion
Approved the swapped synonym
Performed a merge

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Attempting to merge tags results in an error pageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I saw the same behavior just now, with an without the synonym.  Then I tried the reverse without synonym -- which succeeded.  Then I tried renaming it (via merge), which also failed.  Interestingly, `clockworkmod-recovery (s)` showed in the auto-complete, despite the fact that it should not exist any more and is not a synonym either.  (It is suggested as a synonym for `clockworkmod`, however; that suggestion ought to have been removed along with the tag, I would think.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That suggestion was mine. Maybe a couple more votes for it would "push it through" automatically?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I think that synonym suggestion may have been relevant here. I was able to complete the merge by going into the synonym suggestion and reversing it to point the other direction, approving it, and then doing the merge.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good point! And glad it solved that way. Still I'd consider this a bug, as the system should have either resolved it automatically or at least pointed out the "conflict".


















All the close reasons count as one "type of flag" for this purpose. If you've VTC'ed or flagged with a close reason, you can't VTC or flag again with a close reason, even if it's a different reason.

The spam and offensive flags work in the same way: if you've flagged as spam, you can't also flag as offensive, but you can still VTC or flag with a close reason.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Interesting. Is there a list of the 'types' of flags there are? Or is it simply those 3 (spam, VTC, moderator)? And why isn't "it is very low quality" considered a VTC?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think there's a specific list: it matches the review/moderation queue that the flagged post will go into. You can only add a post once to each review queue. Very low quality is separate because it has its own queue.


















Are questions about durability of android devices and the materials used (like gorilla glass) offtopic?

I know that asking for battery durability (how long battery needs to be replaced instead of how long a charge lasts) is not.

There are also several questions on SD card rewrites.

Also questions on https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=resistance%20screenscreen resistance.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about durability and/or resistance of android devices and the materials used (like gorilla glass, SD cards, batteries) offtopic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say all of them are kind of "gray area". While most SD card and battery questions are behavior-oriented (how to use your Android device), especially material-properties are at least very dark. What makes gorilla glass special is definitely no Android question, for example – and you should handle your device with care no matter what. I'm afraid, a clear "yes" or "no" to this question is not possible, all depends on context.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm going to disagree with Izzy.  I think the answer is yes, they are off topic.  I don't see a special reason to allow questions about other parts but not batteries.  And I think the same reasoning applies -- most answers will be opinion and relatively Android-independent.  Our expertise is usage, not the tolerances etc. of electronics.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can someone give me an answer I can vote on? http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77900/marking-comment-as-an-answerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mindwin there you go :)


















Due to the restrictions on posting comments, I am often forced into adding an answer and stating that I am unable to add comments. (Here is an example of an 'answer' that is more a comment: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5miz0w254vdok66/Screenshot_2014-10-21-21-11-38.png?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/5miz0w254vdok66/Screenshot_2014-10-21-21-11-38.png?dl=0) 

Now the theory behind the restrictions on comments is well and good, however many users will not mark an answer as correct, or mark it up- once they get their answer they're happy. Understanding that my 'answers' are never intended as answers, more comments ( thus marking it up or correct is irrelevant) . I'd just like to see the ability to allow me to comment on a question. 

I know this'll fall under "off topic", but I would really appreciate anyone advising me of an alternative to adding comments as answer.

While you stated that it should be a comment, I don't think so. Some of your "comments" are as good as stand-alone answers themselves. I also that you have quite participation on Ask Ubuntu, so I guess you already understand how SE sites works (rep, privilege, etc). I also observe that this site doesn't have much activity, hence the slowness in getting rep. But don't give up! I upvoted some of your answers that I believe is correct. And lastly, this post should have been posted on [meta] instead, just in case you don't know :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[Just this](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment) and [Why it is there](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/214173/why-do-i-need-50-reputation-to-comment-what-can-i-do-instead)


















Flagging as spam is correct in this case, IMO. The answer doesn't answer the question, even though it's relevant. It's a half-apology ("we're sorry this happens sometimes, but we're not going to help") combined with an advert ("so would you like to look at some of our products"). I note that this answer has already been removed as spam, so you clearly weren't the only person to think this was the best response. The poster is free to write a new answer if they're going to answer the question this time.
I think there are a few related cases (similar possible answers) that are worth discussing.

I'm sorry to hear about that. It's not possible to solve that problem with that product alone, but we also sell another product/an upgrade, at http://somecompany.example/products/thethingyouwanthttp://somecompany.example/products/thethingyouwant

I think an answer like this would pretty clearly be included in our policy that promotional content is OK so long as there is disclosure and it's relevant to the question. In fact, I'd say this is still a good answer, even if the original question was about a competing product from another vendor, so long as the product being recommended solves the problem.

I'm sorry to hear you've had trouble. Because our awesome product is so flexible, you can solve the problem by ...
By the way, you might like to see our other products at http://somecompany.example/productshttp://somecompany.example/products

Here the promotional content isn't relevant to the question, which is a bit spammy. The rest of the answer is relevant. In a case like this, I think I'd be tempted to just edit out the spammy content, with a helpful edit remark like, "This part of your post isn't relevant to the question. I've removed it to make sure your post isn't removed as spam." Note that normally one shouldn't edit out spam links (or other spam content) from posts; it's just that in this case it's probably just a helpful answerer who doesn't understand the community's expectations.

In this case, it's pretty clearly just an email signature the support staff thought it would be a good idea to include. We often get people including signatures in posts, and the recommended response is to just edit it out. You can use the edit message to suggest that they include the link & signature content in their user profile. As above, the intent probably wasn't to spam, it's just ignorance of what's expected.

IMO deleting is an abrupt thing to do to a person who thought this was a forum, but then Im no expert on moderating busy sites. So lets agree that that answer deserves to be deleted, right?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@aitchnyu It's not a matter whether it is an abrupt thing or not, but SE is a Q&A site, not a forum; answers should try to solve the problem. Usually, wrong answer will get downvoted but not deleted, but as mentioned in this answer, it's not even trying to solve the case, so it's not an answer (worse, it's a spam). So it's rightly deleted. Your action to post this case on Meta was also appreciated :)


















A https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2252/how-do-i-turn-off-auto-complete-when-textingquestion was posted several years ago asking for directions on turning off auto-complete for their keyboard on their device. In the question, a specific device is stated (Droid X).

Recently, a new user posted an https://android.stackexchange.com/a/87113/11190answer that gives directions specifically for a different device (Galaxy Note 3)

The way the question title is worded ("How do I turn off auto-complete when texting?"), this answer is helpful. But the details in the question make this particular answer useless to the original questioner.

What should be done with this answer? It is obviously useful to someone with a Galaxy Note 3, and they could easily find this question when searching for help. Should the answer be flagged/deleted because it doesn't answer the actual question? Or should it be left there as an answer, since it is helpful?

Or perhaps should the original question be altered to be more general, and have a community wiki as the answer with device-specific instruction sections? (Seems like too much work and probably not a desired solution, but it's a thought).

I'm not sure how to moderate the answer, so I skipped it, but I thought I would see what other people think so I know how to moderate other answers like it in the future.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should we do with answers that specify directions for a different device/version from the question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Similarly, with questions for specific older android versions and new answers for newer versions of android.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In my opinion: it's an attempt to answer, so deleting it seems inappropriate. It doesn't work for the OP's specific configuration, but if we consider the more generic question, then I don't see any harm in leaving it. It's an unfortunate byproduct of OEM fragmentation, I suppose.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm still thinking how to improve the quality for this case. [This question](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/78708/is-it-possible-to-remove-the-battery-percentage-on-my-samsung-s5/87882#87882) asks how to turn off the battery percentage on Samsung S5, but there are 2 answers based on Sony Xperia, which are not useful based on the comment. Worse case, I'd downvote them as not useful at all (in the context of the question), but I would also like to know the official moderation on [android.se] specifically.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, we have this same problem over on [Photo](http://photo.stackexchange.com/), with different camera models, possibly even worse. Newbies are often unsure of what aspects of a problem are brand or model specific and which are applicable broadly. If the question is really model specific, I'd suggest editing the title to make that clear, and then suggesting the person who answered for a different model do a new jeopardy-style ask-and-answer for that model.

It's recently come to my attention that there are two different generations of the Moto X, thanks to https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/63753TomG's suggested edit.  I would assume that these devices are pretty different.  Should we split them up?  What should we name the tags?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Split up the Moto X tags?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we're going to do that, how about splitting [tag:nexus-7] too?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMHO, we should do some researches first (based on device spec & features, and based on questions posted here) to know the differences between generations, then decide if it is worth the tag splitting. Also, [tag:motorola-moto-g].


















I just saw a question a few minutes ago that was asking about if there was anything he could do to temporarily be unblocked by a person on WhatsApp, but it was closed by an admin because it was too subjective..

The close reason is not "too subjective", but "Android-independent" since it's not an issue exclusive to Android.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess I misinterpreted it as him asking for an app for him to be able to do so, but my opinion on this topic remains the same.


















Sure. This is one of the topics we actually define specifically as on-topic on our https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicHelp Center:


  If your question generally covers...
  
  
  Using your Android device 
  Using a particular app on your Android device 
  Trying to solve an error or other issue in using your Android
  device
  
  
  then this is the right place to ask. 

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would, however, say that questions should show some research effort. If googling your question gives an answer on the vendor's website as the first result, the question is still on-topic, but you can expect it to be downvoted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also note that questions specific to some "service", but not directly Android-related, might be seen different ("general service-specific questions", which quite often pop up e.g. for Whatsapp). Let me put eldarerathis' emphasizing into that light: "Using a particular app ***on your Android device***", not "using a particular service in general" ;)


















imho, leave the answer, just perhaps make sure it is worded along the lines of "by the way, here's how to do it with device Y".  Since i'm a newbie, when searching for answers i often find a question that's close and it is definitely helpful to have answers for multiple devices (as long as it's clear what device each answer is for - preferably near the beginning of the answer).  Or at least have links to the same question for different devices.  (btw, i tried to leave a comment, as others have done here, but being a newbie i didn't have enough rep to post a comment, so posting this as an answer ;-)

I've made two questions related to the moto 360 but I do not have enough rep to create a tag. So if anyone could modify the question to add the tag would be great.

I have an open question (with a bounty) on which some suggestions for answers were given. Now the question is suddenly protected but the existing answers removed. ATM there is no way for me to accept one of the given answers and to reward the bounty.

Is this an error or am I missing something?

The question:
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/89622/how-to-use-gps-without-using-google-location-servicesHow to use GPS without using Google Location Services
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why are the answers to my question removed and the question protected?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Two were deleted by myself, which had basically no relation to the question at all. The account that posted them has a somewhat...unusual post history that also factored into this significantly. The third was flagged, apparently, though handled by another mod. I'll need to defer that explanation to him for the time being, at least (he should be notified of this question, though). The protection was a system-imposed one that kicks in after 3 answers get deleted, but it seems excessive here so I'm lifting that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ok. I have only seen 2 answers (from two different accounts)  of which one answer was indeed completely off. The other however was more or less what I asked for, I just needed a bit of time to test it a bit better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For what it's worth, the other answer I removed was posted by the same account as the one you've described as "completely off", and was equally irrelevant to your question. I think it was probably deleted before you had a chance to log in and see the notification, which was then removed from your inbox. The account appeared to be trying to win some bounties but (without going into too many specifics) was not "playing fair". So just to allay any possible concerns: those two weren't deleted simply for being wrong (that's what we have voting for, after all).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I may add the only half-way useful answer was deleted after bein flagged for its low quality by multiple users. See [our discussion on what makes an answer high quality](http://meta.softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/q/356/185) for details on that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The other answer was flagged and didn't look to be of very high quality when I was reviewing the mod queue (and came from a 1 rep user). On this second review (and with your input) it does seem to be an answer to the question. I'll undelete it, but if someone could improve the quality of it, that'd be great.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, the answer is a bit low on description, I'll ask the user to add some relevant data.
If he does not respond to this I could do it myself but adding to the answer is normally not allowed/appropriate within Stackexchange I believe?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think that depends. If it'd give the answer a completely different meaning, it shouldn't be done. But if you e.g. include details from "behind a link" of a "link-only answer" which is "orphaned" by its original poster, that's fine. Between the two, there's a kind of "gray area" of course. To me, your approach sounds good: Ask the answerer to improve, and if there's no response, do it yourself (while making clear which part is yours – e.g. introducing it with "Edit by Requist:").b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could someone post an official answer instead of using comment to answer? Because... well, it's an answer to this meta question (also, to prevent unanswered question bump by Community user)


















If you want to manually award a bounty, you need to click the bounty icon next to the answer you've chosen. It looks a faded version of the icon that appears after a bounty is won by an answer:



Accepting an answer does not explicitly award a bounty. You could, for example, bounty a different answer if you chose. However, since you accepted an answer and did not explicitly award the bounty to anyone, the full bounty was automatically awarded to the answer you accepted once the grace period expired. Had you not accepted an answer, then half the bounty would have been awarded to the highest scoring answer (with a score of at least 2) posted after your bounty began.

Additional information can be found in the Help Center article: https://android.stackexchange.com/help/bountyWhat is a bounty?.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh my. What does the second of our posts say? Same minute at least, probably you were a little faster to push the button as your answer is on top of mine now :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The timestamp claims mine was 34 seconds faster :Pb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And apparently I got a hat in the process of making that screenshot. Neat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK: Congrats then :) Oh: and screenshots earn awards? Then I should have gotten one today as well (but didn't). Nevermind, got a secret hat instead :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It was actually for [starting a bounty](http://winterbash2014.stackexchange.com/gelt), so you could go do that too! I just immediately refunded it after I took the screenshot, and didn't even realize I would end up with a hat..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's the difference between a head-hunter and a hat-hunter, heh? #D


















You will have to award the bounty before it expires. One day before that happens, you get a reminder, then there's a "grace period" – and if you missed that, too, community awards it to either the accepted answer (if any), or the highest rated one.
The above is the short variant – a longer one should be https://android.stackexchange.com/help/bountysomewhere in our help pages ;)
TL;DR:

How is a bounty awarded?
The bounty period lasts 7 days. Bounties must have a minimum duration of at least 1 day. After the bounty ends, there is a grace period of 24 hours to manually award the bounty. Simply click the bounty award icon next to each answer to permanently award your bounty to the answerer. (You cannot award a bounty to your own answer.)
If you do not award your bounty within 7 days (plus the grace period), the highest voted answer created after the bounty started with a minimum score of 2 will be awarded half the bounty amount. If two or more eligible answers have the same score (i.e., their scores are tied), the oldest answer is awarded the bounty. If there's no answer meeting those criteria, the bounty is not awarded to anyone.
If the bounty was started by the question owner, and the question owner accepts an answer posted during the bounty period, and the bounty expires without an explicit award then we assume the bounty owner liked the answer they accepted and award it the full bounty amount at the time of bounty expiration.

The dawn of a new year, 2015, now approaches, or has already approached, either way it means that it is now time to reset our Community Promotion Ads!

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting Android apps
the site's twitter account
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 220 x 250 pixels
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1851here.

We just got some flags on this "answer":


  sáng sadsadsadsafsafsafsafsafsafsafsafsa


There were 6 flags, of all types.  Some of the wrong ones were from longtime users who ought to know by now what the different flags mean.

The above is not an answer.  It is not spam (advertisement), nor is it offensive (abusive / hate speech); there is no excuse for using those flags for this.  Spam and offensive flags are treated as high-priority by the system and are intended for something that is actively hurting the site or its users; this post is merely dumb.

The remaining flag type is a bit more confusing.  "Very low quality" is for something that looks like an answer, but is indecipherable or requires so much editing that it's not worth anyone's time to fix.  The above is clearly not a quality post, but it's also clearly not an attempt to answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Explanation of different flag typesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the clarifying words, Matthew! I admit being one of the "wrong-flaggers" on this: I felt offended by the abuse of an answer, "just to be seen" the only reason I could imagine it was made. My apologies for not considering it might raise "alert signals" on the "mod console" this way (I never was mod on SE) – and NAA would have been sufficient here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy That's fair, all of the flag types have a degree of ambiguity.  "Spam" has come to be associated with anything unwanted or low-quality too, but SE has stuck to more traditional definitions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How is this not actively harming the site? It makes the site look like a pile of gibberish.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JanDvorak An answer written in some non-English language would also fall into "pile of gibberish". Would you still think that it would be actively harming the site (just because the poster is  unaware of using English only)? Another established user may very well translate (Google/Bing translate) it into English. // However, the example in the question certainly isn't an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I wouldn't classify a non-english language as a pile of gibberish. Posting "asdfasdfasdfasdf" cannot be accounted to misunderstanding, posting "pouvez vous trouver un erreur dans mon program" can. The former is a deliberate abuse of the site, the latter is just a double non-answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know how well-behaved the reviewers are on this site (and I certainly don't want flaggers to keep a table), but I would rather not trust the Stack Overflow reviewers to not robo-accept these answers, even if these robots can only dispute flags, not reject them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@JanDvorak I would say that gibberish is *passively* making the site worse.


















I https://android.stackexchange.com/q/95326/12202asked a question on https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.play.games&hl=enGoogle Play Games, which is an Android application. It got closed as off-topic.

https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichttps://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic says that "Using a particular app on your Android device" is on-topic.

So I am confused: why did my question on Google Play Games get closed?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why did my question on Google Play Games get closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't cast a vote either way, but most probably: because [your question](http://android.stackexchange.com/q/95326/981) is not about using the app on your Android device. It is about whether or not there exists a website frontend for the service, independent of the app (or Android).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Thanks, I see. I've re-posted it on http://gaming.stackexchange.com/ then (http://gaming.stackexchange.com/q/201532/19400), not sure how it is going to be received there. Maybe http://webapps.stackexchange.com/ otherwise. Any other ideas of SE where that could be on-topic by any chance?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure. We haven't seen many questions along this vein, to be honest. It's kind of a weird area between Android-specific and maybe-not-so-much. The only roughly similar situation I can think of is Google Voice, and in the past we've generally directed people to Webapps for questions about interacting with the GV service outside the app (as in, via a browser).

All of the core libraries compile to mono, the UI (an important part) is the only thing that did not, because of windows specific code. Which I knew. They did start on the UI for linux, but I am not sure how far they got. Once I get this new release out, I will focus some of my free time to getting it running on linux too, just for you Izzy :)


















Lately I have noticed a TON of these questions.  It seems to me that the process is basically the same for any device —use ADB to pull files, or install a custom recovery and do a Nandroid backup, etc.  Would it be better just to have a single question that we can collapse the solutions into?

There are a couple other question types that could benefit from this too, notably "I forgot my device password, halp" which seems to have questions closed as dupes somewhat irregularly and to different questions.  I would appreciate suggestions as to which post we should turn into the canonical one (if we do so at all), and any other questions for other topics that should have the same treatment.

  Some of the wrong ones were from longtime users who ought to know by now what the different flags mean.


I'm (definitely) not a long-time user, but I feel that the current explanations are slightly (just slightly; no more no less) mismatched with the actual descriptions:

https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/122443/266094The Very Low Quality Flag is https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/122443/266094officially defined for (reworded for your reading experience):


Severe formatting issues. The post is not worth salvaging and should be deleted. Like, right when it was posted, and only the original posted him(her)self can salvage the post after hours of hard work. Okay I exaggerate, but such severity of formatting issues does exist:


Caps mixed in with horrible use of spacing, fragments of words harming readability, code blocks and blockquotes are misused of such severity that deems the post unreadable to an average user even to a reasonable tolerance.
CHECK OUT MY CODE
var foo = new foo();
foo += foo - foo + bar + -bar * bar
console.log(foo);

Severe content issues. For decent examples, check out http://gemsfromstackexchange.tumblr.com/Gems From Stack Exchange — Most screenshotted posts there deserves a missle wave of VLQ flags.


https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/22174/266094The Offensive Flag is https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/22174/266094officially defined for (reworded for your reading experience):


Extreme case! Harsh destruction is needed. The content itself makes it 100% certain of a need of a nuclear blast. Cases such as:


Hate or abusive speech.
The post has more than severe formatting or content problems.
Inappropriate for no matter whoever looks at it, such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NsfwNSFW pictures.



Bonus: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/234035/266094Shog9 himself has said that "If someone is abusing the site by posting gibberish, flag it as such." This establishes a need to flag "asdf"-like content with https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/22174/266094The Offensive Flag.

Therefore, while it's true that your linked answer is not SPAM, VLQ flags and Offensive flags were correct approaches to take in this case; Not An Answer flags do not have an official FAQ post on The Meta, however according to their description:


  This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question. It should possibly be an edit, a comment, another question, or deleted altogether.


This kind of flags are for anything that fell into the wrong box — and is a question / a need of bounty / comment / resource recommendation that should have been in a comment, not its own post / et cetera. Abusive posts should be flagged with The Offensive Flag or, at minimal, The Very Low Quality Flag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[This](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/22174/266094), which you linked 3 times, does not support your argument at all.  `Even if a post is a bad post for some reason or other, it is probably not offensive. The Offensive flag is meant to be used only in extreme cases, like hate speech, or abuse.`  The question it duplicates says the same in its answer.  Your link about VLQ also says nothing about content, just formatting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead Shog's answer does, however. What else is needed?


















While reviewing, I came across https://android.stackexchange.com/a/96939/23379this answer as a late answer. Even if the question does not answer the OP's question directly, it provides some clear and detailed insight on the question on hand.

If we delete this one, (which IMO is the applicable option to this scenario, since this is more of an explanation, rather than an answer), OP may not get the benefit of having this insight.

Answerer cannot add these details in the comments as well.

What would be the best response to this type of situation?

To some extent this can be generalised but since most of the solutions are low level, it would be wise to have a generic question per brand or similar. For instance, Samsung devices use ODIN/Download mode while most of the others use fastboot. Both can be used to access the device while either of them uses a different approach.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why shouldn't all methods be in one spot?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There are many Chinese devices that neither supports ODIN nor fastboot flashing (I have two such devices). Having a per brand question/answer would result in too much scattering since users can't recall every question and they won't be able to direct a new user to the existing solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps it would be best to have a "metaquestion" that would describe the generic way with all the devices specific steps being linked to their respective questions. And, of course, we'd have to accept the fact that we can't support every single device on the market, especially those with low penetration. As for the non-fastboot Chinese devices, what approach is there to flash them, if any?


















Google released https://www.google.fr/design/spec/material-design/introduction.htmlMaterial Design Guidelines and Android Lolipop (5.0) is fully using this guidelines. As the non-meta site still use old icon (from Gingerbread, It's a great occasion to give a major refresh on Android Enthusiasts Exchange. 

Any edit with some example of what it could be is appreciate.

I hope the request will be assess.


















I think its not possible to know from every android device in the world either if they use fastboot or odin or even which sequence of buttons they need to use...i think its just better a generic topic that should point people to xda-developers forum where they can find their right info for their devices plus more generic information about the process

Reffering to this item of the https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicoff-topic list in the help section:


Recommendations, like "Which phone is better?" or "Can you suggest an app that does X?"


I would like to ask this:

It already happened three times. My Motorola XT890 locked itself from being kept in the pocket, showing the 'too many password attempts' screen and requiring Internet connection to get unlocked via a Google Account.
If there's no Internet connection active when it got locked, the system won't offer a standard way of activate it to be able to authenticate, leaving us to a factory reset and some other https://android.stackexchange.com/a/35848complicated ways to bypass this problem.
Thinking about avoiding getting into this situation again, what choices do I have among apps and configuration settings with the unlocked phone?

Is it too speculative and off-topic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about recommendations to avoid unlocking on-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unless I'm misunderstanding your question, it would seem like you could simply not ask *What apps can I choose from?*, but instead ask a more general *How can I prevent this?* If the solution happens to be an app, then people will typicaly be more than happy to suggest one to you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks. I'll change the question and ask.

I've just noticed https://android.stackexchange.com/q/98330/16575What is the Android Permission “WRITE_GSERVICES” doing? with a long discussion in its comments whether it should have been closed. True, there is a "general list" in https://android.stackexchange.com/q/38388/16575What do android application permissions mean? – but I doubt it will ever be complete. We also have a general question on https://android.stackexchange.com/q/1184/16575How do I root my Android device? – yet we allow for one question per device.

I'd vote we hold it the same with permissions: One question per permission, where it can be explained with multiple answers. That question then can be linked back to the "general index".

Especially in the example mentioned above, this makes a lot of sense. The permission asked for is not documented at all – and even Ryan mixed "Google Service Map" with "Google Map Service" (i.e. even experienced people get confused on that one). I thus voted to re-open that question – and here I vote to:


  Let's permit one (in-depth) question per Permission, and use the general list as "index" – as we do with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rootingrooting questions.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Shall we really close questions on permission meanings as duplicates to the "general list"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can get behind supporting this. And really the reason I linked it with "Google Maps" had to do with the "READ_GSERVICES" permission, because there is a 'bug' that requires anything that uses the Maps api to request the READ_GSERVICES permission. by the time i saw the error in my ways, the comments had blown out and didn't want to add another comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the background, Ryan! Didn't think the two would really be related. Is that a "real bug", or intended behavior (requiring `READ_GSERVICES` for "Google Maps")? // Also thanks for supporting my request! I see the Q already has 3 votes to re-open. As soon as that's through, I will place the link (and maybe we should "cleanup the comments"?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As from the upvotes to the question (and Ryans comment) I see some consent here already, I've made my suggestion an answer for you to vote on. Feel free to (downvote and) add a counter-answer if you disagree :)


















I don't think this is the same as rooting questions.  Each permission gives access to (a) specific thing(s), there's not a potentially long and complicated answer for each one.

We could organize answers better, but I think splitting it up into different questions just makes it harder to find.  I'd rather focus on formatting.  For example, we could split each "Group" into its own answer.

To address this specific point:


  I doubt it will ever be complete


I don't think splitting it up will help completion.  If we can't manage the list in one spot, we definitely can't handle it in multiple spots.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree, Matthew. Questions on a single permission can require quite elaborate answers (see just the one on READ_PHONE_STATE). Having all of them in a single "thread" would be everything, but definitely not structured and comprehensible. Think of only 5 such detailed answers as with the example mentioned, all mixed on a single page. How would you be supposed to filter out the ones for the permission you're interested in, without jumping around the page like a squirrel hunting for hazelnuts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy You search.  Having multiple questions doesn't reduce the need for search.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It does: You check the (alphabetically sorted) index for the permission, and find one or more links next to each other. Following up those links, you find pages which exclusively deal with that one permission. If we have one page to deal with 200+ permissions, some of them having 5+ answers, it's simply a mess.


















The Help Center page https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicWhat topics can I as about here? has the following sections:


  
  Recommendations, like "Which phone is better?" or "Can you suggest an app that does X?"
  Shopping advice and suggestions, including what device to buy or where to buy it
  


This is because shopping questions have no one definite answer, and as such are a bad fit for a question/answer site. Each user has their own preferences and use patterns, and therefore the answers can't be really considered universal.

Therefore, in my opinion, your question is better suited on a forum instead of a q/a site. Maybe you'll find a suitable place listed in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questionsWhere can I as questions that aren't Android Enthusiasts questions?

I just wanted to know if someone has this device already what are their views and will they recommend it to someone else ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Amit it's far too open in that regard. I could say that the Galaxy S5 is the absolute best phone there is, and you'll spend a fortune on one and find it tacky and plastic and bloated. What I like in a phone is often not what others like.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Amit Asking for `their views and will they recommend it` **is** asking for an opinion. It's basically the definition of opinion, which is why reviews are problematic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another point is that if any phone is recommended here, it can't stay for long. New phones are being launched every now and then, and none can be recommended for a long period of time. So, if the feature is introduced, it will have to be updated with each launch of a new phone, and that will be a major burden on the moderators. Why? "Seek happiness for others, and you'll be happy doing so. " - Me. :)


















I am releasing a new version of my application Droid Explorer. With this new release, I have incorporated the use of the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/droidexplorerdroidexplorer tag. Right from the title bar of the application, users that are having problems will be directed AE by clicking on "Ask for Help". They are encouraged to look there and ask a new question if it is not answered already. 



I am not looking to use AE as a place to report bugs, as I already have a place for that, and the users can easily do that from within the application as well. What I am looking to achieve with this is reducing the number of "non-bugs" that get reported when users just need help. A lot of the issues users have may have already been answered on AE, they just might not know to look here. If a question is asked and it is a bug, or other forms of a question that is off-topic, then that question should meet the same fate as any other question that is off-topic.

I am not looking to get anyone here to be my product support. I will be monitoring the droidexplorer tag via multiple forms of media (rss, website, mobile app, etc). With that said, I also will not stop anyone from answering a question about droid explorer either. 

100% of the users of Droid Explorer are Android users. I am an active user here and have been since it was in beta. It seemed like a marriage meant to be. I hope that it makes more people aware of this community and that they get the help that they need, with all of their Android related questions. My goal is to help Android users, whether they are having issues with Google Play, CyanogenMod, or Droid Explorer, and help grow the AE community. I feel that answering a users questions about Google Play is no different than a question about Droid Explorer.

I am not the first to have this idea, https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/277810/ie-web-development-support-moving-to-stack-overflowIE Web Development Support Moving to Stack Overflow, and https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/277943/32502Microsoft is not the only company that is doing this.

I would like to hear your thoughts on this. I created the droidexplorer tag a little over a month ago. I have not yet released the version of Droid Explorer that has this feature, but I plan to release it by the end of day on 2/13/2015.

As for avatars (profile pictures), make sure to permit Gravatar in Ghostery (under "Widgets"). Images in posts are usually hosted on Imgur – no idea where that should be blocked.

This seems fine to me. There's a clear software component to the question, meaning that Android is (I can only assume) a relevant factor to the process. The fact that there is an app needed would lend more credence to this idea.

Where I would generally try to draw the line is: does something about Android as software have a meaningful impact? In cases where it's iffy then I think erring on the side of acceptance is certainly fine, but things that are likely to be considered off-topic are simply those where it is obvious that there are not any software considerations when using the accessory.

"How do I install a screen protector properly?" comes to mind as something that would fall into the latter (Android independent) category. Although instructions may vary between devices, it is not Android, the software, that causes that variance.

Today we moved the site's CSS to a newly refactored LESS system so that it's easier for us to fix SE network CSS bugs globally and launch new features in the future! The updates also allow us to use SVG for retina support. 

But while we were in there, we thought it would be a good idea to update the site's visual aesthetic as well, given that this design was https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/417/new-design-launchedlaunched over four years ago, and Google has since launched their http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.htmlMaterial Design guidelines. We drew inspiration from the Material Design colors, typography, and animations plus the other wonderful sites and apps that use these design principles.

We've fixed a LOT of obscure bugs that arose when new features were not thoroughly tested across the entire network. This update should retro-actively fix most of the old design bugs. Once the site is live, if you see any new ones, or old ones not yet fixed, please post an answer here to let us know!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Major design updates are now live!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Looking forward for the update, especially the animations! :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"typography" - so this means we will have Roboto finally? :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And speaking of "material design" (Lollipop): I indeed stopped noticing we're still on Honeycomb here... :) Just hoping the new design breaks no scripts (especially the AutoReviewComments with our "canned responses", as that would be really nasty). So thanks for the warnings – so we can watch out what will happen!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@hichris123 we have been using "Roboto" in the font stack for this site right now. Do you not see it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@izzy We won't be adjusting any scripts, just CSS. I'm not familiar with the AutoReviewComments. Is that a custom script set up for this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[SE-AutoReviewComments](https://github.com/Benjol/SE-AutoReviewComments) is a helper for active users on any SE site, providing canned responses for frequent things (e.g. off-topic causes, LQ hints) – and allowing the user to define his/her own comments, adjusting existing ones, etc. Pretty useful, I wouldn't want to do without that. For some things, it hooks into `#ids` (e.g. `#userinfo`) and also `.classes` (e.g. `.action-list`). If those are not touched, the script won't be affected. Otherwise, we'll need to fix it :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy everything should be fine since we're not adjusting any html or class ID's, just pure CSS.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Great! Thanks for letting us know. I'm looking forward to the new design then with much more optimism (disclosure: I'm part of the dev crew of that userscript :) – or better put: with "positive anticipation only". Plain sunshine, big clouds are gone :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Jin Now I do. ;) I meant on non-Android devices - http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/785/44836.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's perfect. Great job. And WOW, the voting animations!!!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just wanted to confirm: No script got broken. And after the "usual confusion" (it's been quite a time with the previous design), I must say I love it! Congrats!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the new logo supposed to look like an acorn?


















Overall I like the new theme. Feels much fresher.
A couple of things I'd like to mention:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed Adding images to posts doesn't seem to be working for me now. The transparent gray overlay appears on top of the modal. Trying to click the dialog instead causes a click on the transparent layer, which dismisses the dialog. This is Chrome 41, Windows 7. The below images were added by editing a post on a different site and copying the links over here.


https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/status-completedstatus-completed The icon in the SE menu is different from the favicon. Is there a plan to make these the same? I like the favicon much better, personally:


Speaking of icons, the one in the header logo on the main site is very faint. I actually like it better in green, because right now you can barely see it due to the lack of contrast. I understand if this may have been a deliberate choice, but I personally think it looks odd. Excuse my poor Paint.NET skills on this one, but here's a kind of general comparison.




b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your feedback! #1&2 are fixed. You may need to refresh your browser to see the changes. For the logo, it was a deliberate design choice to use a more subtle logo in the header.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm down with subtle, but the blue is really hard to see.  Maybe make it a bit lighter, or a faded green or something.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KurtisBeavers as for the logo: what about a little drop-shadow? `#hlogo a {filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px #222);}` (basically "stolen" from [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23130537) looks fine to me, also here on Meta :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy But is drop-shadow "Material"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@w3d who cares – as long as it looks good? :)

The icon has been updated.



I like the design as well.

The "flair" icon needs to be updated as it is using the older version:

The flair icons have not updated. In fact, look at eldarerathis answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not your browser cache, @Doorknob is talking about server cache. The flair is only updated every 24-48 hours.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe it's a server caching issue. I'll investigate. Either way, it should be updated soon. Thanks.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KurtisBeavers it is at least for me. Marvellous job you guys did, kudos!


















I want to place a bounty on https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/70069/second-spellchecker-doesnt-workthis question but I think I already did that some time ago. Is it why I don't see the "start bounty" link at the bottom of the question, despite the question being indicated as "eligible for bounty"?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can a bounty be started twice on the same question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I doubt that's the reason. I've seen several questions with multiple bounties, though I currently don't know which those were. Your rep cannot be the cause either (75 required to set a bounty). Just checked with that question: I can see the "set bounty" link on it.


















You cannot currently offer a second bounty on that question because you do not have enough reputation to do so.

The minimum bounty amount https://android.stackexchange.com/help/bountydoubles on each subsequent bounty you offer on a question:


  Additionally, if you offer multiple bounties on the same question, the minimum spend doubles with each subsequent bounty (50 reputation on the first bounty, 100 reputation on the second, 200 on the third, and so on).


Since you already offered a 100 rep bounty on that question, your second one would therefore need to be at least 200, and you do not have that much rep to offer at the moment.

If any user asks for the requirements of any specific thing (like requiring a newer kernel version for installing Android Lollipop), is it off-topic? 
The user is just asking the requirements, not the actual procedure. It is related to Android, and is a question commonly asked by enthusiasts to further enhance their knowledge about Android. I have read the rules here, and this is no exception, but a similar question was recently marked as off-topic. The question can be found https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/104509/which-kernel-to-use-in-lollipophere. 
If this is off-topic, then please tell me how it is violating the rules and regulations present https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichere. Thanks in advance. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is asking requirements for a specific Android-related thing off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actually, the referenced question clearly is a development question (porting a ROM). But I see your point: phrased differently (e.g. "I want to increase performance of my device / enable a certain kernel feature; are kernels device specific, or can I take any?"), eldarerathis certainly had not thrown the mod-hammer on it. Though it still might be borderline then, *to me* it would look like a power-user question which fits this site. But before making that a "global statement", we'd better wait for more opinions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy , He is just asking whether a specific kernel is required for installing Android Lollipop on his phone. The message he wanted to convey was : "I am trying to port a Lollipop ROM to my device but I don't know much about kernels. Is there a special requirement for a newer kernel in Android Lollipop? Can I install it with 3.4 kernel? " He is not asking how to develop a kernel or port a Lollipop ROM, but whether doing so requires a specific newer kernel. I am open to opinions, though. I don't want to get into any argument over here. A short and simple doubt is all I wanted to clarify.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see that, and that's essentially what I meant (that just a certain phrasing triggered the "development hammer"). And btw, I've just approved your edit; one more approval required, and it should hit the re-open queue. Still, I'm not for a fight but for a consense – so the more voices on this the better.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5He just wanted to ask the above mentioned message, but did not know how to phrase it. This has happened with many questions. 
The thing is, if the user is unable to make an edit, can recognized/trusted moderators converse with him and edit the question themselves? Why should the peer review feature be made a must? What if the user is unable to convey his question at all, and if he doesn't accept an edit just because only he can't understand it? Then, the moderators must discuss and edit it themselves, right? Again, no arguments here. Just expressing my view.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or is the above mentioned feature already present?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First, every user can always edit his own posts. Second, a mods vote is always binding (takes effect immediately without any peer). Third, if rephrased correctly and passing the re-open review queue, it will be re-opened – I cannot remember any event where a mod overruled that. I pointed what might have led to eldarerathis "mod hammer"; he might even revert this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Bingo. Precisely the thing I needed to know. So, a moderator can overrule it if he/she chooses to? I mean, does he/she have like 'the supreme power' over any question asked over similar sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's what they are for :) But as I said: they're normally not using their powers to overrule the community (and I haven't seen that ever on the SE sites I'm active on). They have those powers to be able to act quickly – e.g. take down spam or offense immediately to keep the site clean. You did the right thing bringing it up in Meta to discuss; if the community decides on a way here, the mods will "follow that". And again: mods are human, so eldarerathis might well have just been "a bit quick" – plus I have to admit I might have thrown a "close-vote" on that as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think once in the several years I've moderated here have I re-closed a question the community voted to reopen.  Perhaps a couple dozen times I've done the opposite and reopened after a community closure.  When something is borderline we do our best to favor the poster.


















I reopened the question.  I agree with you that it was just a bit unclear but does seem to be about using an old kernel with a new ROM, which is fully within our purview.  If the user wants to know how to create a custom ROM based on that it would be of-topic, but we give the benefit of the doubt.

Do note that closure is intended to be a temporary state before either deletion or editing and reopening (which is why it now says "on hold").  Quick closure is generally a good thing since it decreases a post's visibility a bit, so it won't gather downvotes while it's being improved and doesn't gather answers focused on the wrong thing.  It is always fully reversible and editing a closed question always nominates it for re-opening.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did not think of it that way. Now, I understand. However, can't such questions be hidden from people who are new to Android Stack Exchange and usually have a lower reputation ? It would prevent spam to some extent and might lower the burden moderators like you have, right? 
Anyway, thanks for clearing my doubts.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@rjt.rockx currently no one (even mods and SE devs) can't hide specific question (unless using ignored tag, but that's user preference). They can only be closed, locked, or deleted.


















Two things I'd mention:


The primary top-left android logo is too similar in colour to the background
The Ask Question button could be highlighted, à la a http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-usagefloating action button, in a different colour and slightly raised.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For your first point, look at this: For the logo, it was a deliberate design choice to use a more subtle logo in the header. –  Kurtis Beaversb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Alagaros There's subtle, and then there's too subtle. I think just bring it out a little bit, not change it entirely.


















As I login to Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange, I browse through the list of newest questions. Some are answered, some are unanswered, some are put on hold, some are duplicate ... and I look up, and I cry out : "Where the hell is the sort button ?!"

Seriously, a sort button would be a good feature for this site. Then, helpful people (like me. :) ) can see which newest questions are unanswered, moderators can see which questions are put on hold and review them again, bounty-hunters can search for questions with a high bounty and answer them, etc. (I know that there are tabs which contain all these grouped into specific categories, but, a sort feature within these tabs would be damn good...)

It would simplify everyone's life... Okay, well maybe not everyone, but almost everyone who browses through Android Enthusiasts with one or the other question. I might not have thought about the amount of code that goes into implementing that feature, and I might not know how tough it is to do so, I might not know the amount of scoldings the wives of those people who code it might give them for coming home late: ( :) ) but hey, it is cool after all, right? If any of the statements above are in any way hurting anyone, please mention it to me, and I'll edit them out. But, think of it. I'm REALLY for this feature's implementation. What about you? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about a sort button?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pinging people in comments only works if they've actually participated in the comment section of a post, otherwise they receive no notifications (very much intentional design).  When people have time and desire to weigh in, they will generally do so. No need to clutter up things with all the random comments.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Okay, I didn't know about that. Sorry.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As far as the specifics of this feature request: it sounds like the search system may accomplish a good chunk of what you're looking for. You can sort any search by votes, date posted or last activity date. You can also put together some pretty specific searches, like some of your examples: [closed questions](http://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=is+question+closed%3A1),  [unanswered questions](http://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=is+question++isanswered%3A1) Are there other sorting criteria you'd like to see?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis, I mean to say that there should be like a 'Sort newest to oldest' feature, or a 'Sort by status (Answered first, Unanswered later) ' or a 'Sort by Views' or something like that everywhere, in search, in tabs, in meta too. That was what I meant to ask.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There already is a "newest" tab everywhere.  Sorting by "answered first" is not useful since you'll get many thousands of answered questions before every seeing an unanswered question, so you might as well look at answered-only.  I can't see a way to sort by views, which would probably be useful (so I think it should be added) within a narrow search -- otherwise it will just show old popular questions which you can get by filtering by `views:superhighnumber` anyways.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead, I feel that sorting by 'answered first' will help users to see whether a similar question to their question already has an answer.


















This is great, looks really nice, except:

Since when's Android blue?
You should use the "Android green" for header and/or logo (CC-BY) listed on http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/brand.html#android-robothttp://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/brand.html#android-robot.

When you're saying


  fix SE network CSS bugs globally


it assumes that other sites have the same design, but they don't, when will this be live on StackOverflow, SuperUser, Unix, ...?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Other sites have the same base structure and use a shared CSS file. Each site then has a custom CSS layered on top for custom site styles. StackOverflow, SuperUser, and Unix have already been updated to use the same base stylesheet.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But they're not materialistic :( They may use base, but it looks like they override everything then...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Certain things are consistent from site to site that weren't before. Most of these things that are now the same are barely noticeable to the naked eye, but make a big difference when you need to release the same features or fix the same bug globally — things like margins, padding, and column width. We wanted to keep consistency where it was essential, but still allow for customization where we could.

The major Material design updates to this site are cool, and increase the look of the site. But, see this comparison:



Screenshot of Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange



Screenshot of Android Enthusiasts Chat Room

Why wasn't the chat room user interface updated too? The Q&A site is on Lollipop, but the Chat Rooms are on Gingerbread. Too much variation. 





Screenshot of Meta Stack Exchange Chat Room

The last screenshot of the Meta Stack Exchange Chat Room looks much better, in fact. It uses bright, vibrant colours and makes chatting lively. So, why not update the Android Enthusiasts one too? Moreover, if Ripple Effects or something like that were added, then that would emphasize on our site's popularity and look. More users would like to go through here, and that means more visitors to this website. 

Plus, can features be added like 'Online indicators', 'Read indicators', etc. and some design improvements like making the user's text be aligned right and the other users' text be aligned left, in a Hangouts-esque style? That would make this site stand out

However, the most feasible request is to update the design to Material only. For the rest of interesting feature requests, unfortunately it won't be easy/feasible since with current structure, all chat rooms are based on 1 design. It's either apply the design to all chat rooms, or only apply to Android.SE, which I'm afraid is too much time consuming just for this. That's my 2 cents.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Thanks for your opinion. I had a feeling about your point, since all chat rooms have the same buttons, the same menus and all that. But, I hadn't thought much of it.


















I am new to Android Enthusiasts, and I was wondering:
Is this site just for discussing android apps/android system, or can you also come here for help on Android app coding issues?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just Android or also developer questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hint: every SE site has that `help/on-topic` page [eldarerathis is referring to in his answer](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/1932/16575). So when usure, that's the first place to check. And, Rumanoid: Thanks for caring!


















Ouch, the animations!

There are now animations for routing actions such as hovering over a voting arrow, or clicking a voting arrow. This is horrible.

Animations attract the user's attention. Attracting the user's attention to what is under the cursor is pointless: the cursor is already there. Attracting the user's attention to a routine action such as voting is wrong, especially since it's merely providing feedback that the button has been clicked.

Wasting the user's attention on something that doesn't require attention is bad user experience. Please remember that you're designing a site to be usable, not to showcase the latest capabilities of CSS 4.2 on Chrome 2016. A usable interface is an interface that doesn't get in the way. Animations triggered by routine events and that grab the user's attention to tell them nothing whatsoever are the antithesis of usability.

Please remove all animations that do not convey information that warrants action.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with the statement that "attracting the user's attention to what is under the cursor is pointless" and that voting is a routine action that doesn't merit special attention. Keep in mind that a majority of the users on the site are not high reputation users. The interaction is a very subtle hint that their upvote or downvote has meaning and a weight to it. On desktops hovering is an interaction and the animation is meant to be a small delightful detail. I strongly disagree that clicking does not merit an animation especially on a site about android: http://tinyurl.com/pv7u2pzb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@KurtisBeavers “Each interaction is thoughtful, perhaps whimsical, but never distracting”. Animations badly fail at not being distracting. Lighting up the button after clicking is good feedback. Making it move isn't.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@giles, you could use your same argument for all of the animations on Google's Material design site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd guess this answer is a response based on [this request on MSE](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252685/i-want-to-have-those-voting-animations-like-on-android-se-pretty-please).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. I'm not a frequent visitor to [android.se], so indeed, the MSE thread is how I learned about that new feature.

Ouch! I still don't understand why the site goes out of its way to be annoying.


















The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be "primarily opinion based".

You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time.

Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions.

I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with Matthew here. I'd even go so far as declaring it an "Android independent device question" – and yes, a shopping recommendation. So in the review queue I'd decide to "keep it closed", it is not really within the scope of our site as I understand it. Still, I left you a comment there which hopefully proves helpful.

The question clearly requires some operation in Android, either setting up new android profiles, or using a particular software. Is questions about android apps not on topic here?

It's not "clear" at all that a platform-independent third party service with web access to its content requires signing up through the app. I've reopened the question.


















It's been a while since Cyanogenmod released its Lollipop based ROMs with the title CM12. However, the tag synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cyanogenmodcyanogenmod are still https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cm11cm11 and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cyanogenmod11cyanogenmod11. Shouldn't there be a new tag synonym named https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cm12cm12 by now?

I've two questions (https://android.stackexchange.com/q/109147/962771, https://android.stackexchange.com/q/106660/962772) that requires specifically the tag https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cm12cm12 over tag https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cyanogenmodcyanogenmod as an example. Also, if you see https://android.stackexchange.com/tags/cyanogenmod/newnew questions under https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cyanogenmodcyanogenmod you'll notice a lot of them at first page related to CM12 specifically.

But we should probably have a generic tag and then separate tags for versions with enough questions, there's definitely enough for that.  I've undone the synonyms for the moment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: [Should we have version-specific CyanogenMod tags?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/1715/should-we-have-version-specific-cyanogenmod-tags) was where this originally came upb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Thank you very much for the link. Now I see how [tag:cm11] tag  came into existence. // Both Moderators:  So what would be next now? I still feel the need for [tag:cm12] tag since while searching "OnePlus One/ S5 and CM12" I don't want any CM 11 or any other  Cyanogenmod results (you get the point).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Thanks.  I think I may have misjudged how much a agreement there was in those comments.  Firelord, I would suggest that we retag questions with `cyanogenmod-11` and `cyanogenmod-12` where appropriate.  We can probably leave plain-jane `cyanogenmod` for legacy versions?  And for general questions about CM.


















That one seems a bit borderline to me.

The reason used, "Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..." is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way. 

But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app.

So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably "you can't".
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I imagine this is probably the reason people voted to close it. In particular, anyone who is not familiar with Instagram (I am personally not; I had to look this up) may not realize that your account is connected to the app directly. A bit of elaboration on the account creation process may be useful for this particular question, to highlight why it is directly tied to the app/Android and not just a question about Instagram as a service.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed. I think I voted to close this question as I was unaware that you can only create accounts via the app. Given that this is the case, I see why it was posted here and that it does in fact appear to be on-topic.


















I made an edit to a query's title:

Original title->

What the s*!+ do I do to make the 4.2 swipe keyboard stop censoring me?


My edited title->

How to disable censoring keyboard on Android 4.2.1


And my edit was rejected apparantly for reason: This edit conflicted with a subsequent edit.

I do get it that writing the s word like that makes it censored. But lets get real here, even a 12 year old kid knows the real word behind that censoring. People wont pronounce it as EssStarExclamationPlus, they will say that complete S word in its original form. You know how bad the impression gets right? This.Is.StackExchange. I like this site because of its discipline, meaningfullness, helpfulness, and constructiveness. Now writing words as F*ck and S$%+ and etc etc is not really fair (or necessary for that matter) is it?

I mean no one wants people to go with these words in every sentence. Once someone begins using them, its a matter of time until numbers increase eventually. Just imagine most problems in stackexchange beginning in such a title..... I am certainly sure most people wont do that, but why even keep this rule? I know people sometimes may go overboard because of frustration due to problems, but I still dont get my edit being rejected. But its not about edit really. I just want to know know why are these allowed, especially here?

In short words, Are the *uncensored words in "censored" form really allowed here? And if yes, why?

PS-> Here's the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/34613/what-the-s-do-i-do-to-make-the-4-2-swipe-keyboard-stop-censoring-methread/post.

About the rejection
The mod says:

This edit conflicted with a subsequent edit.

If you check this message on Google, you'll see https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/286096/what-causes-this-edit-rejection-this-edit-conflicted-with-a-subsequent-editthis meta post on https://stackoverflow.com/Stack Overflow where one answerer wrote:

Someone else edited the question already, and did so in a way that touches the same lines yours does. [It's] a merge conflict, just like with source control systems.

You can verify the quoted answer if you see revisions of the question https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/34613/revisionshere. An another user (Reputation points 2k+; has https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/editedit applies immediately privilege) proposed revision 3 with the changes similar to yours (in the title), although he has fallen back to revision 2 now. One edit had to be forwarded and one to be rejected in that case, which in turn happened to be your edit. Also note that the user who proposed revision 3 was the same user who approved your edit, so no worries at least.
Since the rejection happened not by a user intervention but the way system is designed to handle subsequent edits, you may try to suggest the edit again.
On a side note, considering your history of suggested edits I suggest leaving the question untouched. This issue is now on Meta, so a Moderator or another established/trusted user would possibly try to take care of it.

Not sure if I can ask chat related question here. So, I clicked my username on a AE chat discussion site and a user information popup showing links to my profile,


  "user profile"  //which linked to
  http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/149736/luckyhttp://chat.stackexchange.com/users/149736/lucky
  
  "user profile on android.stackexchange.com"


I clicked on user profile and it opened http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/149736/luckymy chat user page. In the General tab page in my profile the link "parent user" was displayed with all the reputations greater than 200 was combined(2.6k) and displayed next to it. But once I changed it to stackoverflow.com and android enthusiasts, I can't set the "parent user" to display my combined reputations. 

When I click the "change" and in the search box I typed "S" and "The Stack exchange Network" option appeared but the suggestions hides after selecting the option and doesn't have any effect in the profile page either. So How can I get it back to show the combined profile reps or What keywork I need to type in the search box for that?

Update:
Just recently after posting the question, I noticed that the reputation was shown from the AE site and the badges were shown from the combined profile flair.



Here in the screeshot the "462" is the reputation from the AE site and while  the badges(3gold, 24silver and 56bronze) are from the combined sites badges flair. So is combined flair not updating properly? or this is how it works.

But when i changed it to Android Enthusiasts, 462 was displayed. what should I do to display the 2.6k reps back?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think you need to wait for it to be recalculated, I believe this is part of a scheduled job rather than done instantly.  I could be wrong.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just checked your chat user profile and it's displaying back 2.6k rep already, so I guess the issue is moot already? The only reason I can think why this happened is [caching](http://shouldiblamecaching.com/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah It is display after changing the option set back to stack exchange network..sometimes the change works immediately and sometimes not it takes some time and sometimes the data is wrong..I selected travel site and it showed my combined reps under it..sometimes my profile picture is not updated properly after selecting a particular site..The next site I select after selecting the option "The stack exchange network" it is displaying the combined reputation etc..Its very confusing to me..its like different data(profile pic, reputation, site logo, badges) all mixed up together


















Should the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4g4g and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ltelte be merged? Whilst there might technically be a difference between them I don't think most users realise (or care) and both terms are used interchangeably.


  What is LTE?
  
  Though originally marketed as 4G technology, LTE (Long Term Evolution) didn't satisfy the technical requirements that the ITU-R outlined, meaning that many early tariffs sold as 4G weren't actually 4G.
  
  However, due to marketing pressures and the significant advancements that LTE brings to original 3G technologies, the ITU later decided that LTE could be called 4G technology.

The new voting buttons don't look right in all browsers. There are two funny little dots that make them look like smileys. And the smileys have the opposite meaning to what the buttons are used for!

But it would have been in between 50-100...?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We're looking into this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It seems a little strange, that's a lot of "User Was Removed"s. Bear in mind this is an automated process - as TimPost said the humans now have to check it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TimPost Feel free to grab me in chat.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And it happens that you're not the only one who saw that strange behavior on your profile. When you tagged me in a comment [I was surprised](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/22118924#22118924) to see a leap-bound in your reputation and noticed that many of your previous posts were upvoted. It seems that somebody tried to do a favor (or may be otherwise here) to you by serial upvoting but it was against network's policy. I guess only Mods can explain the details after looking into the matter.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord so mods can see who did upvote all my questions? I'm getting curious now, who wants to upvote all my answers? Anyway are there more people having problems like me?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SuperThomasLab Mods can see voting trends. They can't see who voted where (so they can spot serial upvoting).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not really sure about whether they can see or not, but I read somewhere on Meta that they can't! That said, hey! not just answers, your questions also got upvoted, didn't they? // And, you can Google or search on [meta.se] the terms like "voting reversal", "serial upvoting", "serial downvoting" and so on. You'll get posts having users with similar issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord - mods can't see voting details, only voting trends. So on any given post we **can't** see who voted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ChrisF Ah, that comment was in contrast to my previous one. Sorry for the mistake. You may take your comment back and I purged that one.


















Just now I noticed that there were 6 questions tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/5.1.1-lolipop5.1.1-lolipop. In addition to the typo, most of the tagged questions don't seem related to 5.1.1 specifically:

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/111315/failed-updating-and-uninstalling-app-with-adbFailed updating and uninstalling app with ADB


I have cleaned-up those questions:


Renamed the tag to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/5.1.1-lollipop5.1.1-lollipop for related questions
Removed the tag on questions which were not version-dependent
Replaced the tag with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/5.0-lollipop5.0-lollipop for general Lollipop-related question.


Now, when I read the excerpt for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/5.0-lollipop5.0-lollipop


  Android 5.0 is the tenth publicly named Android release, and debuted with the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 in November of 2014. Please only use this tag if you feel your question is specific to Android 5.0.


Before the existence of 5.1 and 5.1.1, the excerpt reads okay; Lollipop-related questions will be tagged with that since there's only 1 suitable tag. But after the release of 5.1 and 5.1.1, newcomers are confused how to tag their questions (https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1283/how-can-i-tag-my-question-in-the-most-effective-wayalthough, that's their fault for not reading help/meta, but still tolerable). But then, I see the problem: currently, it seems that there's no tag for general Android version (e.g. general Lollipop feature/issue). There is https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lollipoplollipop which is synonymized to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/5.0-lollipop5.0-lollipop though.

So, the question is: what can we do to reduce the mistag? What should we do to the question that is for general Android version (e.g. general Lollipop problems)? 

Also possibly related: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1648/do-we-really-need-4-4-2-kitkatDo we really need "4.4.2-kitkat"?

I noticed a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/114166/how-to-get-back-google-play-services-on-micromax-a106-running-lollipopquestion which popped up in Active tab few minutes ago, and was tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/micromax-unitemicromax-unite

Looking at all the questions in that tag, I see that most of them are related to the device "Micromax Unite 2 A106" with one exception of "Micromax Unite 3 Q372". 

I think a tag wiki is definitely needed now to signify the purpose this tag serves, preferably intended to serve a series of devices under a common brand.

I don't know anything about this device, or I could have tried suggesting the wiki.

I think I must work hard on my search queries for Google. And I now have made changes into the question.

If it's related to an issue using Android, then no wonder you're good to ask it here.  If it's just any file you would want to know about irrespective of any issue associated with it, then I would wait for others to chime in here to tell, whether you should ask or not. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5sorry but i have asked the question already @Firelordb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is too vague to be useful.

It seems on-topic to me (and others) and you seem to have gotten a good answer. This question here is still too vague to be useful to future readers.


















Generally, our device-specific tags follow the pattern <manufacturer>-<device>, which is the case for all Motorola devices as well – with the exception of the Moto-X.

Shouldn't we …


Rename https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/moto-xmoto-x to motorola-moto-x to match that pattern
optionally, have a moto-x synonym pointing to the renamed tag?


PS: Same for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/moto-emoto-e and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/motorola-moto-emotorola-moto-e plus https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsung-galaxy-note-3samsung-galaxy-note-3 and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsung-note-3samsung-note-3 it seems.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Rename 'moto-x' to 'motorola-moto-x'?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would agree but "Moto X" is a family now: 1st Gen, and now the 2nd Gen. So [motorola-moto-x] would  really be device specific to 1st Gen, leaving the younger 2nd Gen down the path.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Not sure whether they all need separate tags (we have other examples with "one tag for a family", see e.g. the `nexus*` tags). But of course, an option would be, while being on it, to create a "group" of tags using the pattern `motorola-moto-x-?gen` or `motorola-moto-x-????` (so either by "gen" or by "year")b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I thought we did have `-x#` tags. I'll have to look when I'm not on mobile.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead We definitely have not, I've checked that (and just now re-checked). Typing `moto-x` in the search box on the tags page gives only one result: `moto-x` itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm indifferent as to how we handle the 1st/2nd generation thing, but `motorola-moto-x` would at least be consistent with our other tags, even if we intended it to cover the whole "family".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis I've just added the moto-e to this list, same thing (Firelord just pointed that out on chat). Time for some action, maybe? As for your "generation issue": we don't have that currently AFAIK, so fixing the tag doesn't touch this issue – which can be dealt with separately if we see the need.


















On https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/113388/alarm-silent-even-when-not-in-silent-modethis question user https://android.stackexchange.com/users/112588/abhioxicabhioxic came up with the solution in a comment, not in an answer. This comment was one hour before the bounty expiration, so had it been an answer I could accept it and award the bounty.

Is there any way for https://android.stackexchange.com/users/112588/abhioxicabhioxic to convert his comment into an answer and to accept the bounty?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Answered bounty in comment, not answerb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, Diamonds (aka Moderators) can move it into an answer, if they are satisfied that the comment indeed is an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord: Thank you, I have flagged the question for moderator attention with an explanation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Moderators actually cannot move comments into answers. They can move answers into comments only (/cc @Firelord). There's honestly not much that can be done in this kind of situation. You could potentially post the comment as an answer yourself after some time, mark it Community Wiki, and credit the original author, but the author would not receive the bounty in that scenario.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis Thank you very much for correcting me. I thought the otherwise was also possible, but now it's clear that it's not. (Although I kinda slightly remember  that it happened to me when I was a new user, but since you're a Moderator and know the stuff, I guess that memory is messed up.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5IMHO, abhioxic was correct to post that as a comment, since all of the points were asking for clarification. I think he was unsure too if it might solve the issue. Unfortunately, he didn't respond when you pinged him through the comment. Posting a community wiki answer crediting him is the proper thing that you could do (as you have done it)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT.: Absolutely. It is just unfortunate that we didn't have enough time to turn his insightful comment into an answer.


















In a https://android.stackexchange.com/q/114799/27149question I asked few days back a user named https://android.stackexchange.com/users/116446/ajayajay(with 1 reputation point) answered my question which was flagged for deletion by me and then user https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/114799/moto-g2-speaker-phone-issue-when-calling/115037#comment143145_114799Izzy added a comment on behalf of ajay and flagged his answer for deletion. Since it was more like a comment rather than an answer, the solution provided by ajay was deleted yesterday. But the exact answer is seen now as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/114799/moto-g2-speaker-phone-issue-when-calling/115037#comment143207_114799a comment from ajay under my question.

Considering a user has to get to gain 50 reputation points to get the commenting previlege. How is this possible for a user with one reputation to comment? Does the user allowed to comment or Is it something that a moderator has an option/tool that has converted the answer to a comment. Because it is shown as commented 4 days back but I haven't seen the comment yesterday. I have no idea how can this happen so, Can some explain this to me?

And how these comments that are converted from answer to a comment ordered? Is this added as the last comment to the question or does it have some ordering based on timestamp? 

Update:

In my case that ajay has answered(11th July) before user @Izzy commented(14th July). So that I thought ajay's comment is visible before Izzy's comment based on timestamp. I'm confused on how the ordering of comment is based on and does diamond mods have special priorities on the comment section?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How come a single reputation user able to comment and ordering of comments that are converted from answers to comments?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just as confirmation: I don't remember having seen ajay's comment when I "converted his answer" either, so the 2nd strange thing is how it comes to appear before mine. Makes me look stupid somehow :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No it was not there when you comment until I just saw the comment today from ajay after his answer was deleted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for that feedback, Lucky! I was already questioning my sanity #Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Based on [this comment from eldarerathis♦](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/1975/answered-bounty-in-comment-not-answer#comment4466_1975) mod stating _"Moderators can move answers into comments"_ I get that Moderators(♦) can turn answers to comments and the reason in the order it is appearing before your comment is based on timestamp of the answer(My guess totally). ;).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yupp, that was my guess too. Good find!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Correct, the answer was converted to a comment by @matthewreadb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, I cleaned up your comments on that question since they are no longer needed :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't realize Izzy had commented when I did this, apologies for the confusion.


















In this case, the answer was converted to a comment by @MatthewRead
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What is the order of the comments that are converted from "answer to comments" displayed? See my updated question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lucky it uses the same timestamp as the original answer, see this image for example: http://i.imgur.com/Kt3DIxT.pngb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes it uses the same timestamp..But my question is When that answer is converted to a comment, where does this comment actually go? Is it displayed as a last comment or some sort of ordering based on timestamp? Both are conflicting with my question and Firelords case. It is not displayed as a last comment and in Firelord's case it is not displayed in order of timestamp.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Comments are ordered by timestamp, so it would be inserted into the list of comments at the appropriate timestamp of the conversation. So in this case, the comment was inserted before Izzy's.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unfortunately, I can't answer that because I'm not a mod there and cannot see the full history of that question and its answers. I would assume the answer was added after the mod's comment, then converted to a comment, which would correctly put it after the mod's comment. But that's just my assumption.


















While Bryan Denny ♦ already cleared the mist https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1977/96277here, I strictly recommend reading the question: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/75189/286110Who are the diamond moderators, and what is their role?, and the very  helpful answers there including https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/75192/286110this one which says:


  Diamond moderators are human exception handlers. The main function of diamond moderators is to follow up on flagged posts but they also have some special abilities necessary to handle rare exceptional conditions:
  
  
  They have access to all the abilities of 20k users regardless of their reputation.
  Their votes are binding. Any place we have voting — close, open, delete, undelete, offensive, migration, etc — that vote will reach the threshold and take effect immediately if a single diamond moderator casts a vote.
  They can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on, commented, or changed in any way.
  They can see more data in the system, including vote statistics (but not ‘who voted for this post’) and user profile information.
  They can view all deleted posts on an individual user's profile.
  They can place users in timed suspension, and delete users if necessary.
  They can perform large-scale maintenance actions such as merging questions and tags, tag synonym approvals, unbounded question migration, and so forth.
  They can convert a post into Community Wiki status, or convert an answer into a comment.
  They can (at their discretion) refund and cancel a bounty.
  They are not subject to the flag, close vote, delete vote, review count, etc. limits. (https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/189303/180276source)

I guessed it was aligned with the order of timestamp. But the comment you mentioned in your answer in not reflecting that. I'm still confused with how the ordering of comments took place. Is there any priorities for visiblity or something to diamond mods in comments section?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Lucky Good point. I suggest you edit the question and reflect this confusion about ordering of comments and time stamp a bit more, because it was possibly missed by Bryan while answering, and I missed it somehow too. In the mean time I'll see if there is any related post somewhere on other meta sites.


















Considering questions about Android development are off-topic here, a lot of them are asked! How can we make it really clear when asking a question that it shouldn't be about development and these questions should instead be asked on Stack Overflow?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Preventing Android development questions being askedb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Afraid we can't. As hard as we try (and we did in the past), some people first write and then, maybe or not, read (and even if, then not necessarily the hints on what's on-topic). We even have a "development" tag where excerpt and wiki state "OFF-TOPIC!!!" – still we get development questions even using that tag. Afraid not even an electric fence would help with that …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Damn. Would it be possible to add a filter system that blocks questions with the 'development' tag or that include certain words related to development or would that not be possible because of the Stack Exchange architecture?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All discussed already.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/7593/how-can-i-track-app-usage/115919#115919This link will lead to an spam answer (affiliation wasn't disclosed; posted by user117708, now nuked!) which is deleted as of now, and only 10k and above reputation points holder would be able to see it.

Before I marked the answer as SPAM I rejected a suggested edit on it because I considered it to be polishing the SPAM. I also vaguely remember that, before checking my helpful flags to find that the flag was resolved as helpful I was the only one who reviewed that edit.

Now that I neither can find that deleted answer in my review history nor in the Suggestions history of the user who suggested that edit, I'm curious to know what exactly happened to that edit, or what usually happens to such an edit?


Did other reviewers review it and the edit was resolved as approved/rejected?
Did a Moderator (a human) review it?
In case none of the reviewers or the Moderators reviewed it, did Community ♦ jump in and post a predefine message?
Perhaps a possibility I'm missing here. What would that be?

I was bewildered when I saw https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/100170this edit approved by a Moderator until I saw https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/116466/using-usb-on-the-go-files-with-the-stock-android-music-app#comment145415_116466his comment explaining the reasoning for that action. Before that edit, the same editor suggested another edit https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/100057here. Note that https://android.stackexchange.com/users/118614/moreoflessthe editor and the https://android.stackexchange.com/users/118597/moreoflessauthor of the post shares the same name, which is what I meant in  the title. (But sometimes, the name of the editor is different, and the edit note in the comment or the body says that s/he is the author of it.) 

https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/116466/2Revision 2 was https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/100057approved by users (non-Moderators) which is the central issue here. 

I should clear my stand that I'm not questioning the judgement of my peers, but I rather need a consensus from the Community (especially from Moderators) here whether edits from users posing as the author of the post should be approved by non-Moderators or not?

The reason I focused on 'approve' and not 'review' is because I see so issue in rejecting such edits downright but with a custom explanation. 

Related edits I once encountered:


https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/97507https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/97507 (did accounts merge later, since editor and author have same user ID:115733)
https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/97529https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/97529 (odd because the author approved it, though https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/114534/apps-storing-data-in-non-existent-sd-card#comment141780_114534later explained it when asked)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should users (non-Moderators) approve an edit made by a user posing as the author of the post?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As someone who approved one of the edits you've mentioned, I am interested in the thoughts of the community too. Personally I think that If the edit adds useful information to the question then I don't see why it should be rejected, although I think a comment should be left advising the user to merge their accounts. What do you see as the benefit to rejecting the edit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmdixon  I reject them on the ground that they deviate from what the author originally said (additional info in such edits usually means clarifying the situation when asked by readers from the comments, and that should only come from the Poster, not somebody else). Even if I'm convinced somehow that both users are same, I won't go for Approve (since only Mods can verify the things) because that would mean allowing the user to violate the edit guidelines, and user might take it as a wrong message. I prefer rejecting them with a custom message pointing to a comment having an explanation for it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fair enough, that's not something I've really considered before. You're right about it allowing them to violate the rules (even if it _is_ the same person, just a different user). I'm interested to hear what others think, I'll certainly consider these edits differently from now on though.


















You, as a user, are absolutely right to reject such edits.

As a mod I am able to see the account's e-mail address, IP, etc.  Putting all factors together, I was certain the two users were one and the same.  I wouldn't have approved the edit otherwise.

The account merge process is relatively slow (TBH I resent the fact that they took the ability to do it away from all moderators based on the fact that others misused it), so I think overall it was the best thing to do here so that they can get help.

We obviously don't want to encourage multiple unregistered accounts and such, but this is not something I've done regularly either.  If we want a zero tolerance policy I can live with that.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the answer.  I thought the site's Moderators could always merge the two accounts on the same site until saw the fact here. I suppose that's the reason you approved [this edit](http://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/100170) yet the accounts are yet to be merged. // The related edit I mentioned [here](http://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/97507): is this the case of account merge? The author and editor are same.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord Your guess about the second one is correct, I can see that the users were merged on the same day the edit was proposed -- presumably after the edit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the clarification. I will reject edits like this in future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ehhh, I wouldn't word it so strongly. It seems that your answer is interpreted as forbidding accepting these edits, but I don't see what's wrong with accepting such edits (assuming of course that the clues point to the second account being the same user).


















Post one question at a time in your made up case.


  I can't download apps, and I also can't connect to yahoo [..], but I can connect to everything else.


The first part would mostly deal with the issues specific to app store/market app you're using, say Google Play Store. Since you can  connect to everything else, it implies that the problem is specific to app itself -- eligible and should be asked as a different question.

In this case, the market app you are using would be diagnosed for issues. Starting from the error code you may be having, like "Error -505", then to the device specifications, and so on. 

In the second part, you can connect to everything but Yahoo!. The first thing that comes to mind is whether this is connection specific or not i.e. is the problem specific to mobile data or Wi-Fi or both (I'm ignoring other network interfaces here)?


If Wi-Fi specific, the troubleshooting would be  trying other Wi-Fi and more based on details in question.
If Mobile data, then it may be a DNS issue, ISP blocking the request, and so on.
If both, then the users would suggest more troubleshooting (hint: a malware).


(I suggested hypothetical troubleshooting, and actual troubleshooting steps could vary wildly. Nonetheless, the issues are separate.)

As you can see, the problems are more or less independent here, so they should remain separated.



Now, this answer wouldn't really help if I don't give a general solution. 

Take a look at this question: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/117394/on-the-latest-version-of-android-how-can-i-disable-google-chromes-incognito-moOn Android, how can I disable Google Chrome's incognito mode?. It bloomed from its parent question when a user gave such suggestion: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/117299/when-you-lock-down-a-lollipop-device-to-disable-chromes-incognito-mode-this-crWhen you lock down a Lollipop device to disable Chrome's incognito mode, this creates an XML "restrictions file". What actual XML is inside the file?

You would notice that the parent question could accommodate the child question in very few lines, considering the context parent question already has. Yet, it was decided by the poster to ask it as a separate question with details enough to make it stand out. It was a good judgement because the parent question is quite long (a bit messy too).

In simpler terms, always prefer to ask separate questions. If you cannot, then try hard not to intertwine those issues. Write them into separate sections so that they are easy to follow. The users who would detect that they are separate issues would possibly leave a comment explaining the reasoning and the suggestion to ask it as a separate question.

The reason I said not to mix  them is because you now would be saved from a tangled question once you attempt to separate those issues into separate questions.



Note: Always do search and research (specially on the main site) before asking such questions, because if any of the issue has been raised earlier, then you would get a lot of info to identify whether the issues should be separated or not.

E.g. If you do a simple search like https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=[google-play-store]+unable+to+downloadthis here, you would see Q/A that would make you realize that the issue "I can't download apps" is altogether specific to Play Store only in your made up case.

Also note that you can link your two questions (mentioning the "other one" as "maybe related"). -- https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1987/if-i-have-two-problems-that-may-or-may-not-be-related-should-i-post-them-as-one#comment4514_1988suggested by Izzy.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also note you can link your two questions (mentioning the "other one" as "maybe related"). I this case, with a vague "everything else" working but e.g. Playstore and GooglePlay not, it might well be related in terms of certificates (assuming "everything else" works unencrypted, which is not clear here). So, as Firelord wrote: first "do search and research", then post separate questions and link between them "for reference".


















The https://android.stackexchange.com/a/117620/51249answer in question:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZla7.png

I flagged the following answer as "very low quality" because it was pure speculation, didn't offer any explanation or research and was poorly written in general. Was I being too unreasonable?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this an acceptable answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Note sure, but this question could be closed later as too localized. Nonetheless, you probably should  get good answer(s) before it may get closed.


















It just came to my mind, what would be our reaction if it is written as: 

"Go to Google app which use your location to personalize it. Go to app and disable it. Hope it helps." 

It is still a hypothesis because it isn't proved how Google app is related to the question, but since in my made up answer the user wrote with confidence, we wouldn't be having  much reason to flag it as VLQ, other than content based issue.

Now, for the real point. In its current condition, it's not a very low quality answer for two parameters but one, which I explained below. 

Reasoning for VLQ isn't very clear but the flag excerpt says:


  This question has severe formatting or content problems. This question is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed. 



The editing is acceptable, though not up to our site's standard for the posts, so it can be edited to make it look good.
There isn't much about formatting in it to talk about
Content problem -- that's where I found it problematic and I left a comment in that regard.


The reason I didn't mark it as a VLQ answer is because we have multitude of such answers on the main site, and while they don't reason well, they many times help the visitors to get rid of the issue, which the latter is most interested in.

The suggestion I would like to give is to use a downvote (if only you're convinced that the answer is wrong or not useful), or leave a comment explaining the issue and providing suggestion. 

I see that you upvoted my comment, so you indirectly already did your part of commenting on the answer.

Note that to flag or not to flag as VLQ  also creates a dilemma of whether to allow such answers on this site or be moderate/strict in controlling them. If you're a moderate/strict in approach then don't think your action as unreasonable even if your flag ends up as Declined.

As for me, I use all the approaches all the time! 


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for taking the time to reply!


















While I can follow https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1991/16575Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: "It may be … Could you try …". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven.

My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question.

BUT: answerer included "solve the issue as it did for me", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear:


  In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way:
  
  
  Got to google app which use ur location to personalize it.
  Go to app and disable it.
  


Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :)

EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:


If you're sure you have a valid solution (as in this case, where it has solved the same issue for you): Answer.
If unsure whether something "promising" really solves the issue (aka "could you try if X helps?"), make it a comment.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But even in the current edit, I'm not convinced how that app is related to the issue technically. It is possible that poster cannot or isn't able to provide technical details but at least we can come to know how he realized or what method did he successfully follow to troubleshoot the issue. E.g. I put a note in my answer [here](http://android.stackexchange.com/a/114106/96277) which tells the user how I approached the issue. // On a side note, it is possible that I'm having hard time understanding that simple answer. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't say I'm convinced this is the one-and-only solution. It might even be a co-incidence. Nevertheless, it's a valid answer if it worked. We've got many answers which work for some but not for others, don't we? ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with this thinking.  Using comments to prove an answer is *right* before posting it is not the way things should work.  Keep in mind too that the ideal question is applicable to many people, and thus there may be many different solutions that work for others but not OP.  I do agree that your wording of the answer is far better, but I don't think it changes the substance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead I didn't mean this case here as a "general rule". When not sure (aka "could you try if X helps?"), IMHO a comment should be preferred over an answer. But in our case, the answerer had the same issue and solved it that way – so here I don't see that it should be a comment first. // Guess we both are thinking the same, just my wording wasn't "catching"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Agreed and understood, my apologies for misinterpreting.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apologies are mine for not being clear enough, @MatthewRead – I hope my edit improves on that :)


















The design choice of having a vibrant blue on top of a slightly different vibrant blue at the header of the site and questions is very jarring and difficult to look at. As someone who spends a lot of time on StackExchange this is by far the worst and most jarring design choice I have seen and made me not want to stick around. 

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pr3ah.png

It seems that most of it is coming from the white text on the bright blue, maybe it is also the font choice? Typically when white text is used in Material Design is is a heavier weight font (yes I know Roboto was used here) and is used sparingly if at all on light vibrant backgrounds.

A slightly more subdued pair of blues, taken directly from the https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-paletteMaterial Design Guidelines  works much better and is less straining.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/qxS1p.jpg

Something like this with #1976D2 for the upper background and #2196F3 for the question header strip:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gtw1O.jpg
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5White text on blue header is difficult to readb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How is it jarring?  The ligher-blue "box" behind the title text is not something you need to focus on, it doesn't need extreme constrast from its background.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead I guess it's mostly just that the colors are so vibrant with somewhat small white knockout text on them that it is hard to read/focus comfortably.  After spending a few seconds reading a question title it literally burns that blue into my vision even after I look away from the screen. Am I really the first person to have said this?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead You will also notice that in the Material Design guidelines they switch to the use of black text with this shade of blue and lighter shaded because of legibility issues.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh, if the text is the issue that's more understandable.  I don't personally find black text more readable with that background but it's certainly subjective.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you have something in mind? How about proposing the design (image) or an idea (image) you think *wouldn't be worst*? There is no concrete direction in the question as of now other than the fact that you dislike the current design.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I added some screenshots. My main point was that the site is clearly trying to follow the Android/Material Design style, but is missing a bit by using the wrong color/white text pairing per what the guidelines describe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MattRockwell You're right! I too feel the same. The blue is lighter and white is obviously lighter color. Dark backgroudn on Light text or vice-versa could be nice. Anyway I'm always using my [Android Dark theme userstyle](https://userstyles.org/styles/116735/android-stackexchange-customized-darktheme) on my Chrome using the Stylish extension. You can try that but I've customized many other parts than just header so if know css, you can create you own custom css styling for any website you want. ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5With my current settings on my monitor, I found it hard to notice the difference between current and proposed design, nor do I have issue with current design at all. I can only notice that it's darker/stronger than [metase] header. But again, I acknowledge that this is design issue and might be very subjective to each.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Subjective or not, it is currently violating the Material Design guidelines. It's wrong. If the effort is going to be taken to design it so that it resembles the Android design, it shouldn't be sloppy/half done.


















I feel a bounty was awarded to me incorrectly https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/118956/my-nexus-6-turns-itself-off-randomly-how-can-i-fix-this/119314#119314here.

The question is dead simple. What are Android-independent questions? If that's a broad thing to answer, then alternatively, how do I identify that a question is Android-independent?

There are some related questions which I should mention here:

I've checked all of them and none of them gives me fine impression on what's considered as Android-independent. Up until now, whatever the number of questions I've flagged or voted to close as Android-independent  were based on the instinct https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_itI know it when I see it which says:

(Emphasis mine)


  The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasephrase "I know it when I see it" is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialcolloquial https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(language)expression by which a speaker attempts to categorize an observable fact or event, although the category is subjective or lacks clearly defined parameters. 


I don't have any set of parameters which can guide or help me in identifying Android-independent questions other than a vague description in help center:


  Android-independent questions, such as "Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?"


It is not hard for me to skip a question where I fail to judge whether the question is on-topic or not, but what bugs me is the lack of reasoning when I find question like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/119868/is-there-some-hidden-admin-in-a-whatsapp-groupIs there some hidden admin in a WhatsApp group? being put on hold or voted to close for being Android-independent question. (Note that I'm not questioning anyone's judgement here.)

That lack of reasoning is related to the on-topic guideline which says:


  Using a particular app on your Android device


I get the point that some of the apps are cross-platform but as long as the author is using them on the Android, they should be treated as on-topic. 

Some questions that I encountered and were closed as Android-independent:


https://i.stack.imgur.com/lvNi9.pngInstalling kali linux on android? (this is dealing with Android device so it's on-topic and the close vote has expired now)
https://i.stack.imgur.com/rHGkr.pngHow to leave from a Viber group permanently (a proper case wasn't established by poster that the app is running on Android so it could've been closed as unclear at best, but I still don't consider it Android-independent)
https://i.stack.imgur.com/0GJaV.pngIs my android when turned on constantly sending radio data to my provider? (I failed to judge it)


Some Android-independent questions are too easy or takes moderate efforts to identify, but the ones dealing with apps are hard for me to judge. Can I know why those questions dealing with apps like the ones I linked get to be closed as off-topic (Android-independent)?

It's not like I can continue to skip the questions for eternity!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What are Android-independent questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There's a slight differents between "issues with *using* an app on Android", and asking for specific features on a wide-spread multi-platform "virus" like WhatsApp. While I'd consider the former on-topic, I'd VTC the latter as "Android independent".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy But I'm trying to argue that as long as that cross-platform app is used on Android then the question should be considered as "Using a particular app on your Android device". Why do we **discriminate** against such apps just because the developer decided to support multiple platforms? It's not the fault of the poster that the app is cross-platform. 2) Could you elaborate on "issues with using an app on Android"? I'm suspecting that you mean issues related to Android OS somehow, such as connectivity, SD card, crash, and more. Is that so?.....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5But that would be your own definition IMO. Can you bring me a meta post or help center link which supports your definition?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You've got my idea of "using an app" correctly. The *philosophy* of an app is a completely different thing, not having to do with Android – whether the app is x-platform or not. I bet you'd agree on this exaggerated example: "how to reach the next level in Tetris". Just because Tetris might be available on Android, I'd still consider that off-topic and "Android independent".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for relevant posts: [Is this question off-topic?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/1733/16575): "you're asking about a company who might be doing something in this arena and if you can get into their beta program. That's off-topic here. Go ask them." // [Are questions about LINE on-topic here?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/1450/16575): "as long as the question relates in some way to being Android usage … these questions are fine". Also related are [hardware questions](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/905/16575). Please check there for context!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree this close reason is the trickiest to judge. Meanwhile, reviewing also need efforts, sometimes including researching. In case you're not sure, just skip it (I know I skipped a lot). Now, back to the question, here is my opinion: 1) "hidden admin in WA group" is Android independent, because it applies to all platform in general, 2) "installing Kali Linux" is borderline. If [this question about Windows](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/18858/) is acceptable, then Kali is no different... (cont'd)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e53) "leave Viber group permanently" is unclear except for Viber users, and after researching a bit, I can say it's Android-independent, which mean: there's no way to prevent the issue, *even* on other platforms = it's Viber issue, not related to Android. 4) "Android constantly sending radio data" is unclear/borderline. If it happens on *all* mobile phones, then it's independent of Android (generally, if it's more about the technology like wireless charging, big chance it's Android-independent), and I assume it happens on iOS and Windows Phones too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Thanks for the time your put here. For your first comment: yeah, I guess I forgot the point that reviewing occasionally does need more efforts than we normally put.1)  *"because it applies to all platform in general"* -- in that case can we elaborate in help center (one/two line) that the guideline *"Using a particular app on your Android device"* is restricted to issues dealing specifically with Android OS and not just about  any issue with any app that happens to be supported for Android... continued..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Or perhaps in the off-topic guideline that app questions that are applicable to other platforms as well are off-topic here because they do not meet the criteria "*Basically, what problem (with your Android device) are you trying to solve?*" specifically.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm open to all suggestions that improve the quality, though it's mod privilege to update help center. Honestly, this post has a big potential by defining which is closeable and which isn't. I hope the rest of this community can chime in too...


















Despite being off-topic on AE, questions about app development are frequently asked here. I generally flag these as needing migration to SO as opposed to marking them as off-topic, because they should have been asked there in the first place, but I often see questions about app development that have been put on hold instead of migrated.

Should development questions be put on hold or migrated to SO? If they should always be migrated to SO, why is there a reason in the flagging menu to put them on hold?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should development questions be put on hold or migrated to SO?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As harsh as it is, SE network has this as a general rule: [don't migrate crap](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work).


















We must not become part in bringing down the quality of the flagship product of SE. 

A lot of development/programming questions we receive here  tends either to debug the app without explaining how to recreate the scenario, or simply throws up logcat's output without even preformatting it, or other things that are at odds with SO guidelines. There are very few questions  we receive here that are clearly written and well-formatted. 

Migrating those bad/poor questions to SO (a site which already receives a  lot of poorly written development/programming questions) would only burden the site. What's more? If I would happen to be regular at SO and start seeing such  questions being migrated to SO, then I might end up questioning the judgement of whole community for such act.  

I believe we should migrate only  well-written and well-formatted questions. Putting the rest on hold would not only teach those newbies how to ask but would also tell them where not to ask. 

This isn't only about development questions. I keep this opinion to app suggestions or recommendations as well. I rarely flag for migration to Software Recommendations. Usually, I vote to close them since the guidelines for Softwarerecs.se is very clear and detailed, and most of the questions we receive here don't meet those guidelines. Migrating them to a beta site is definitely a strict no.

That's just my opinion!



It is another matter that our efforts in bringing down the amount of development/programming questions are not up to the mark.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related [Why was this question closed as off-topic without being migrated?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/91411)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is completely correct.  Most questions we get are either unformatted code dumps, or absurdly broad/give-me-teh-codez questions.  It's quite rare when something deserves migration.


















I'm confused. On my https://android.stackexchange.com/users/90252/scritterprofile  page a -2 showed up.

I have not received voting privileges and hasn't intentionally downvoted anyone.  How did I lose 2 points?

I am also wondering -  on my answer https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/87504/how-do-i-clear-clipboard-contents-on-samsung-galaxy-tab-s/120344#120344here where I lost the above points there is a -1 between the voting arrows.

What is it? I thought it showed accrued points. What am I missing?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've not downvoted any post but I lost two points. What's going on?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Without checking: A post might have been removed where you previously earned +2 (e.g. via an edit), as your "also wondering" confirms: when that happens, rep is "undone" – i.e. downvote substracts are given back, upvote earnings taken back. At least for rep "recently earned" (not sure how far back that reaches, AFAIR something like 3 or 6 months).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5None of my posts have disappeared - I corrected my own post, so doing this removed the points gained from making the post?  I hope I'm not just being dense...Does this mean I actually lost a point in answering a question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Nope, editing a post doesn't remove previously earned rep (though as a result, a downvote might if it was a bad edit :) Firelord figured out your case meanwhile. And yes, downvotes without explanations are a problem – I wish people doing that would leave a hint in the comments, unless it's something too obvious :)


















Here is the breakdown:

You had 1+5+2=8 points until an hour ago.   

https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Linl.png

https://i.stack.imgur.com/kTAmO.png

Then you received a downvote on a post of yours which took two points out of the total, ending up at 6 points.

https://i.stack.imgur.com/48BCB.png

Now, you pretty much had it all figured out, but you're missing the point stated in help center https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-downhere:

(Emphasis mine)


  
  Downvotes remove 2 reputation from the post owner.
  Downvotes on answers remove 1 reputation from you, the voter.
  


This is simply what happened. You received a single downvote (that -1 between the arrows) on https://android.stackexchange.com/a/120344/96277your answer which took away  two points from your account and one point from the user who downvoted it.

It's there anyway too find out why my answer wss downvoted?, I'd like to improve it or remove it.  btw, thanks for your time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was it downvoted is an altogether different question which you should ask as a separate question (be kind). My take is that the last line seems to be a promotion for the app. It can take further edit in capitalization of words and so. Also, we use quotes not @ when we mention a post's content (not a forum but a Q/A site. See [tour]).  You may consider correcting them and for the first line of the answer, perhaps screenshots can help. // Only the downvoter can truly explain  why the post was considered not useful.


















An Android-Independant issue springs from outside the core operating system.
i.e. an issue that originates from a source external to the device/OS and not an "in house" function  . Which is hard to peg the difference sometimes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So example questions,

Android-Specific Question;


  Hi i installed gapps and when i run/start play it force closes
  immediately. HELP!!!
  
  ps im running 5 adnroid


Response;

You are likely running the wrong gapps version. there is a difference between Android 5.0.X and 5.1.X. Check which Android version you actually have and then what version of GApps you should be running.

Reply from OP;


  Okay yeah derp, i wuz runnning the wrong version evrythings fine now. Byeeee




Android-Specific Question;


  Hi, I am running Android 5.1 stock on a Flexus 42, after update the
  Stock Browser is hanging on pages at random. I've checked out my wifi
  setup and everything is square, what am I missing.


Reply;

If by update you mean that you jumped API levels, meaning from 4.4 to 5.X, then it's likely you have some incompatible data remnants in /sdcard/Android/data that may be causing problems. Reboot to recovery [if custom installed] and perform a factory reset to clear out that data. You need to do that when jumping API levels whether up or down, meaning from JB-->KK or from LP-->JB and so on.

Response from OP;


  Yup, that did it! =) I installed FLRP Recovery. I didn't know about that. Thanks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Android-Independent question;


  yeah, i'm running game snoozle 3.5 on kitkat and when i ttry to log-in
  it say please update to game snoozle 3.5.3/4's but i don't wanna so
  how can i trick the server or hack to app to say it's that version?


Result VTC as OT.

While it is an app running on Android the "problem" originates from an external source and not the OS itself. The same with the app-hacking question. While the question is about an Android app, the problem is with a 3rd party app and not an app that is part of the core system.



Android-Independent question;


  I cross-compiled the tar compression utility through my debian chroot
  on my tab so i can use it in Android natively. I work with some very
  large archives and when trying to compress an archive larger than 1.5
  gb i get this crazy output in terminal and my device hangs and i have
  to reboot. When my device is back on line instead of the archive i was
  trying to create has some wierd name instead $$@$*??? and now i
  can't delete it, no such file. Any ideas?


Result feel bad for the user but VTC as OT.

While Android does have it's own implementation of tar [may depend on stock or custom rom] , the OP is asking about [again] an issue that originates from a source external to Android even though the chroot the binary was compiled in is technically on device. This would also be OT because the issue is more likely the tar source code, as well as this would be a development question.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know some of that sounds like nit-picking but that is what it is.
You walk on some tricky hybrid ground every now and then.

We discriminate 3rd party apps because of the high likelyhood that the issue with those apps originates from the app developer's end and because there are sites that are better geared for that kind of support/shop.

My understanding of SE is 

Question --> Answer .

Not 

Question---> bang out the issue ---> Answer.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Apart from the quality of the question (1st question is terrible :), I agree with all of your examples, though the "tar compression" depends on the context: if it's about how to fix the binary, it's OT; but if it's deleting corrupted file, it's on-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with your first "Android-Independent" example. Would you cite any official link or Meta Q/A supporting that **only** core Android apps are on-topic? On the comments on my question you would notice that app related questions become OT if apps  are cross-platform and the issue exists on all platforms, which means it is not specific to Android now. If I go with your first example then I suppose "[Using a particular app on your Android device](http://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic)" would become invalid.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your second example of Android-Independent question IMO is on border-line. A solid evidence first has to be there to clarify that the issue occurs because of faulty binary (and we can't take care of it because development/prog. is OT here), otherwise, it's on-topic because it is simply dealing with a binary giving weird output on Android shell.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord That's fair, how broad a scopre does AESE intend to cover? I may be thinking more with my xda brain on that one. The second example is actually a problem [the tar binary question] i had last year and was resolved by switching sources. If you consider any problem connecting to an Android-ized shared source as fair game the list could get even longer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree with your reasoning, because there's often no way for the questioner to know what the origin of the issue is. This site is for people who use Android: it's not an Android bug-tracker. We don't care if an issue "comes from" the OS or from an app. The answer may well be an OS-based thing even if the question looks like it's app-specific. e.g. "How can I stop this third-party app sending me notifications all the time" -> "Either fix it within the app or use Android's 'Hide notifications' feature"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dan Hulme , I disagree with your disagree-ment-ous-ness-ity. xD .The problem with `Android users` is not caring where the problem comes from and opting for the blah-fix-it-now-and-i-don't-want-to-be-bothered-with-X-approach. Alot of/most of the problems with/in Android need a logcat, or kmsg or dmesg. And alot of the "simple" answers have the tendency not to work. If you don't care where the issue comes from then there really is no point to this question. So no standard, at all, may as well ask about toasters.


















I am interested in the topic of personalizing my phone, and I imagine other users are also. The tag doesn’t exist currently, and due to lack of points, I cannot create it. 

customization may be a synonym, but the category, personalization, exists in google play store. That is why I think the term should be considered for  tag creation. 

user-interface, interface, could be related tags, unfortunately those don’t exist either currently.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag proposal: personalizationb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5[user-interface](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/user-interface) is an existing tag. You appear to have used it on your question.


















IMHO we don't need a separate tag for that, as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/customizationcustomization (which we already have) covers that perfectly. For ease of transition, we might consider creating personalization as synonym to this – which also had the pro guiding people looking for the right tag, but not as a separate tag.

Our tags do not resemble categories in Google Playstore (one could also point at Google asking to create a "custom-rom", "rooting", or "adblock" category, referencing ASE having a tag for it – I bet no chances for #3 there :)

A question https://android.stackexchange.com/q/63889/20449like this one is in my opinion of a very poor value for a future readers, because it is narrowed to just one application, to just one specific version of that application.

In addition, described problem is not any more reproducible -- metioned application's developer has updated it and in new version the problem itself does not exist anymore (assuming, that using the official ways -- Google Play -- you can only install the newest version of each application).

For questions like that (where OP gives himself his own answer and that answer is something like "problem solved, because..." and that reason causes problem to be not reproducible anymore) we have in Stack Overflow special close reason:


  Flagging > Closing > Off-Topic > This question was caused by a problem that can no longer be reproduced or a simple typographical error. While similar questions may be on-topic here, this one was resolved in a manner unlikely to help future readers (...). 


Shouldn't we have similar close reason here, assuming that this site is devoted to an operating system often being upgraded with a lot of applications, that are even more updated and that many questions my become obsolete, because of an update that fixes disputed problem.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we need "not reproducible" off-topic close reason?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah...in the past we had used "Too Localized" for these, before it was removed from the list. Now we'd have to replace one of our other close reasons or ask SE to expand our list by one (we get 3 customs currently). I suppose another option would be to deal with these using the "Other" reason when we need to, since it may represent a small-ish proportion of questions that get closed. In any case, I agree with your analysis that questions of this nature have no lasting value.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@user981 Why comment, not an answer? :)

Everything you just described is about math.  If you want a calculator app with more operations then you should use one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead no Matthew you are mistaken. My question was at last bit unclear - anyway the users were able to answer it, isn't it nice?


















As already mentioned on https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2013/holding-on-my-thread-is-misunderstanding#comment4580_2013Matthew's comment,


  "How to use the limited set of operations provided by a particular app to calculate arcsin" is a math question. Everything you just described is about math. If you want a calculator app with more operations then you should use one.


Basically, the issues are:


You can't find arcsine function in stock calculator
You know the alternative way to calculate it, but you want the simpler one


The first question is a legit question and actually answerable (answer: there's no operator to do that, install 3rd-party calculator instead). 

However, you dragged our attention to the second question, which is unclear and off-topic:


Unclear, because you don't explain what do you mean by "a simpler way" (do you want the formula? Or setting a macro to calculate that? Or what? What is the device model and available operators in your calculator?).
Off-topic, if you really meant to ask the math formula (we are not the specialists in maths, did you mean to ask it on https://math.stackexchange.com/Mathematics.SE instead?).

The answer  to my question is that the operator arc sine is not a part of the application, but its very strange for me.I meet such a situation first in my life , if we are talking about built-in application like calculator.


















The count flag at the top bar depicting the number of suggested edits pending approval seems to have stuck. The Suggested Edits review queue is empty already.

I tried both Firefox and Chromium browser, even the private browsing, but the issue persists.

I just got my question for a android web-server app marked as off topic. 
And I do see, that software recommendations are an https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicoffence to this clause. Ok, but why? I’m new to Android, and my ability to use, and utilize the OS is dependent on getting apps, which I can then use, and utilize to do things. 

Since apps are a huge part of the Android experience, I’m not sure why asking for software recommendations is off topic. I am just now coming into the android community, and learning to use android. I do not know how to get everything I want to do done, but downloading apps is part of solving that problem.  I feel the basis of software recommendations has a significant level of potential usefulness for new users, and can be objectively rated using the Stack-Exchange formatted website. 

I would like to note, in other OS specific Stack-Exchange communities, "software-recommendation" is an acceptable topic. 

I beseech thee, gods of Android Enthusiast SE MODS, can we consider software-recommendations, as an on topic discussion? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we get software recomendations added to on topic discussions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there an issue with using http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/ ?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Only that I didnt know it existed. Thanks @MatthewRead, I will check that out!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Did you ask your question because of this question: [Are software recommendations on topic or not?](http://meta.askubuntu.com/q/14394)


















We wont, for multiple good reasons.

First, software recommendations are off-topic on many SE sites – with the definitive exception of one being dedicated to this, namely Software Recommendations (see: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2060/16575Where to ask for app recommendations?).

Second, take a look at https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1489/16575What should our new off-topic close reasons be?:


  Questions seeking application recommendations are off-topic as they become obsolete quickly.


Third, they very much tend to attract spam, link-only answers, and the like.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5android is such a different ecosystem compared to 'general software' which could be Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, etc...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5“software recommendations are off-topic on all but one SE site” Where did you get this blatantly incorrect statement? For example [apple.se], [unix.se] and [ubuntu.se] allow software recommendation questions and have no wish to stop doing so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gilles wasn't aware of those exceptions. Answer fixed up accordingly, thanks for pointing out so boldly ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Is it really the case that software recommendations are off-topic on *most* sites? Or rather, yes, software recommendations are *off-topic* on most sites, because those sites aren't about software. But among the sites where software is on-topic, I'm not sure that a majority rejects software recommendation questions. Unless you count by traffic, then because SO doesn't like them and the other sites are negligible quantities.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Gilles feel free to post your own answer. I wrote mine according to my experiences. And I frequently encountered this remark. I'll make another edit changing that to "many" (as you're correct: I'm not familiar with enough SE sites to give such a "big statement" – though I gave it mainly because I was told so in many cases, that there are only few exceptions).


















I found https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/124003/fast-boot-up-on-imx6this post which has a wrong tag. It's basically because the author didn't know what the fastboot tag stands for and have chosen it. However I didn't find any tags which are good for this question. As far as I know the author can't choose no tag, it's forbidden. So what should be done if you don't find any tag where your question fit into. I mean, you can't just choose a wrong tag with the thought "there is no better tag, but I can't change that". 

I don't know if I'm at the right place here, probably some would say, I should post this in meta android but I think it's a general SE question what to do if no tag is good for your question.

Thank you in advance, moderators!

P.S.: Same thing here, I can't post a question with just the tag tag. I have to choose under these "bug feature-request discussion support". It's not bad that you don't want to have every content in the Meta SE, but I think you didn't do it right. currently this would make many content get labeled as discussion just to get it posted.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No matching tagb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've re-tagged it `boot` and `performance`, that should match the issue. Thanks for bringing it up!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For a quick reading why some tags are required in Meta, please read [What's Meta?](http://android.stackexchange.com/help/whats-meta)


















When,


you don't understand which tag is best for the question and all the current tags on the question are not suitable,
when some current tags on the question are not suitable and you can't find a better one


but you still think a better tag is needed, then,


with careful consideration (analyze the question thoughtfully) create a new tag or more -- https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tagsrequires minimum of 300 reputation points
the better choice: ask the veterans. Veterans may not necessarily be those only who've been with the site for a long time but can also be those who are  one or more year old here but are very good and active in editing questions. 


I myself tend to be in situations when I do not understand what tag is best and I do not find it good to create  new tag(s) unless I'm sure there exists no other suitable tag. So I simply post the question on the site's https://android.stackexchange.com/help/badges/35/unsung-herochatroom with a brief note of the requirement and let the others take care of it.  

If the user activity is low on chatroom then you can consider posting a comment on the question like:


  For users: The current tags on the question doesn't properly give the hint about the question, neither the question is actually about them. But I can't think of any better tag as of now, so may be one of you can consider an edit with a better tag. Thanks!


That has been my strategy. You can find your own or may be somebody else would propose a better one. 



As for the meta tags, I'm not placed at best position to comment, but I respectfully disagree with your view about them. Meta isn't a place to  post anything, but it's all about the working of the main site, be it technical or user-centric issue. 

If you look at your question again, you're are asking for best practices on what to be done when tags are not suitable and more.... 

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discussiondiscussion tag exactly fits the question. See its excerpt. It's meant to seek community consensus on an issue.  

If you're not seeking consensus then either you've a problem in using the site which goes into https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/supportsupport, or there is an erroneous behavior you noticed which obviously fits https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bugbug, or you want a new feature, so https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/feature-requestfeature-request goes here. 

Also, if you think that the current mandatory tags doesn't cover everything or most of the issues, then it's better to propose a proper and detailed use-case and then argue with why the current mandatory meta tags doesn't fit the use-case yet the use-case as a question is useful. This would give us a better picture of what's going on in your mind since I (as a normal user), as noted, doesn't find an issue with the mandatory tags. So, how would you convince the users like me?

But reserve the use-case for another question.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you! I also thought about creating a new tag (or in my case, ask for the creation), but I think it's not necessary to create a tag for one specific question. and yes, I am asking for best practices, so I don't understand why mods did move that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If the condition demands then you've to create a tag at some point, though this point shouldn't be the priority. As for why this question was migrated back,  I can't tell for sure, neither would I attempt to. :) Perhaps Mods here or other users can guess.


















I have asked a question a long time ago here on Android Enthusiasts. The question received only one answer back then but unfortunately it did not solve my problem. But now, the question seems to attract more answers to it and I don't even have a way of verifying any of these answers because I have already dumped that phone and I moved on.

What do I do if someone actually comes up with a good solution?

Now to avoid any kind of Meta Effect I am not going to post the link to the question.

Anyhow, irrespective of your wish not to post the question, I would definitely link it since I don't see a good reason not to post it: [How to add secondary patition on sd card to internal memory?](http://android.stackexchange.com/q/75443)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I knew you'd find it anyway! It's the only question I posted for crying out loud! :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, right. But what is Meta Effect?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess you'd be more familiar with it you you were on StackOverflow. The thing is, there are people who bring up posts into meta just to get some rep out of it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord [What is Meta Effect?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/235225/what-is-the-meta-effect). Basically, by bringing a specific post on meta, it will attract community response (whether up/downvoted, flag/close, etc).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There aren't many members who read Meta Android.SE here, the meta effect is negligible btw.


















Stack Exchange is very community-focused, so don't worry that you can't personally verify an answer.  Other users will vote/comment as they see fit and any useful information should float to the top.

If the question itself is localized to a particular situation that others won't encounter, or to software that is no longer available, etc. then the question should probably be closed.  You could flag it with a custom reason (explaining this) if that is the case.

In the case of the specific question Firelord linked, the new answers don't seem very good so I have protected the question; however, it does seem like it will be relevant to future users so I'm not going to close it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds fair enough :)


















The repercussion of the latest changes introduced to the network (See https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/266696Can we raise the bar for reputation for late answers to enter the review queue?) on our main site is reflected in the deleted answer on the link (somebody from an SE site about English language posted it). My Late Answers queue shot up to 573 when normally I keep it under 50. 

But that's not really the problem here since I can continue to review the queue. The problem is I'm seeing answers dated back to 2011, 2012 and 2013 (I'm yet to find one from 2010) and as expected, some (may be more; may be less) definitely needs editing. 

If I start editing them then I would end up showing all those old questions in the Active questions list. This is the issue. 


I risk pushing the new or the recently answered questions. It is more risky because we are not a large site  so every entry counts. By replacing those entries from first or second page, for users with recent answers, I'm taking away their chance of earning points and getting their answers reviewed by peers without the formal process of "Review queue".
In such scenario, because the now active questions are old, people may not be interested in even opening the link let alone seeing whether the question needs good answer or not. A lot of those questions by now already have accepted or considerably upvoted answers so I don't see much merit for people having interest in a  question which is both  old as well as have an accepted answer.


This definitely isn't a long time issue since once reviewers are done with reviewing those old answers, things would  and should look normal.

But I definitely need to know, should I go on editing those answers and end up pushing back the new or any recently answered question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Considering the recent changes in the Late answers queue, should I edit old answers at the cost of recently answered questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5There is always an approach of editing those old questions following an interval, say edit 3 old answers now, then come back in 5-10 hours and edit 3 old answers again and continue the cycle. That seems a long process to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In this particular case, I'd edit if it really needs to be edited, and if it's considered useful (upvoted/answered). Other than that, if it's only a minor typo, or having zero score, I'd just "looks OK" (or downvote/comment/flag/vote). At least it will prevent bumping ~20 questions to active list. (Yeah, it seems unfair to those posts, but I have a reason doing this at this particular event). However, if you want to edit the post, I'd encourage to also edit other posts in the same thread to prevent multiple bumping in the future.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Thanks. I'm following a part of your strategy. I'm simply skipping the answers which doesn't need an edit so as to save myself the review count (the barrier of 20) but I'm editing those which genuinely needs an edit while making sure that none of the other answers on the same page remains in bad shape. If I continue to go slow then the new answers would continue to pile up and I would become overwhelm by the sheer number of answers in queue at some point. Too bad! I think somebody at SE is taking care of this old stuff mess and may be it will be gone soon, automatically.


















The same process should be taken as with any time we've done a tag cleanup — edit slowly.  Just do a few at a time, take a break, and come back later.  Resist the urge to the queue to zero immediately :P

I have not seen SE encourage such flooding before, but there is something to be said for getting it done quick.

One of my https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/124242/disabling-the-google-appquestions was recently closed by moderator Matthew Read.

From the comment he posted, it appears he felt my question constituted "polling".

In fact, I was not interested in "polling", but was simply open to answers from people using any version of Android.

I promptly edited the question by removing all text that could possibly be misconstrued as "polling".  I then posted a comment stating that I had edited the text, and asked Mr. Read to re-open the question.  That was almost a week ago, but nothing has changed.

Unless there is a valid reason for this question to remain closed, please re-open it.

Over the last few weeks, I have discovered that, as most of you probably already know, a lot of questions and answers have very poor grammar. My question is, is editing these to increase the clarity of the post advised or unadvised?

The following image shows an answer posted for the question https://i.stack.imgur.com/YkBkQ.pngHow to change the density (DPI) for specific applications?

The answer didn't even cover half of the line. Anyhow, I flagged the answer as VLQ, albeit being unsure, and to my surprise, the flag was resolved as disputed .
Note: It is not relevant to me  which diamond marked it disputed.
I'm seeking input from the community, what do I do with such answers?
If I start localizing the question here, then for the answer in the image,

it is factually wrong -- doesn't make that eligible for VLQ

Look deeper -- not much to look into -- and you would notice that the pointers cannot be termed unhelpful but some of them are so much universal and vague that I wouldn't ever want to see them as answers, but they, IMHO, are good enough for comments at least.
I don't want to flag them as NAA because that is bound to cause disputed or declined at some point and may create tension. As I see it, we don't seem to have a shared (community specific) understanding for these cases, or may be my search failed me. I hope that this question should reach a consensus where anyone should be able to know what to do with those common half to one to two line vague answers.
I saw the answers to https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/156941/one-liner-answersOne Liner answers and  https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/221149/how-to-differentiate-a-low-quality-answer-and-answer-that-should-be-a-commentHow to differentiate a “low quality answer” and “answer that should be a comment”? Couldn't find them much helping except the interesting fact:

Determining what to flag and how best to flag content comes with experience and to be honest it is not as simple as the list you posted above - it is not black or white but many shades of grey.

Yeah, fifty shades, I got it.
So, what do I do with such answers? Should I just,

leave them alone and hope that somebody else would take care of them
comment on them in regard to explaining the quality requirements of the site
downvote --  if  only it is not helpful, the definition of latter may vary amongst users
flag -- that's what I want to discuss
or, you've something more interesting, such as the cocktail of the above points?

When searching for questions/answers about some hardware-specific topics, would it not be useful to introduce tags for chipset vendors and models/model_families?

Like MediaTek, RockChip, RK3066, MT6582, etc.

Even GPU tags like Mali400, Vivante, etc would (imo) help.

I am not advocating Vendor tags like LG, Motorola, etc.

I think, when used correctly (and frequently corrected by knowledgeable users, if used inappropriately) chipset tags could be very useful.

Specific example: I recently acquired a cheap DualSIM Doogee Voyager2 DG310. Using that name, hardly any information can be found. Using the specific chipset name mt6582, many more relevant posts can be found, and information can be collated much easier.

I see as an added bonus the fact, that people can then better curate their list of preferred/filtered tags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why don't we have tags for Chipset vendors and models?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I personally do not find merit in your question, perhaps because there are not examples for the upper half and your specific one is not specific enough. If you were looking for device specific things, why would you go for a chipset tag which would be having all kind of models with different Android versions, may be even tweaked to certain frequencies and whatnot? What were you thinking of achieving here specifically if a chipset tag had existed? Let's say the community agrees for the tag: give us a **solid** example question, a wiki excerpt and full wiki and justify the tag's  need...


















I wouldn't say "nothing relevant in common" as https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2035/16575Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, if this SE site is "just for end-user questions", I am wrong here. I started getting this impression too, when @MatthewRead removed most of the technical details from one of my questions, although was the first googleable-webpage regrouping the info I had to scrape together from several places. I consider "nothing relevant in common" factually wrong. And actually, with all the very technical posts here, *most* are not end-user-friendly.  I also think this is the "wrong" mission, and technical questions are always good, just give end-users ways to filter complex topics, hence chipset tagsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlexStragies, I didn't state "power users" and "technical challenging questions" are not welcome here (after all, we need people who can solve complicated issues as well). It's just not the majority and not exactly the "main focus" of this site. And tags not used are rather useless (the system would even auto-clean them). What I agree to is "nothing relevant in common" being "factually wrong" – which is why I stated these details should be included "in the question's text", as they are definitely helpful especially with less-known devices :)


















I always get an error when trying to edit posts with an edit of fewer than 6 characters.  

So, how can we suggest an edit that is fewer than 6 characters?  

Some posts are really good, but they only fail to use code tags or back ticks for a set of commands or log. For those posts, I just want to add the code tags or back ticks, but the 6 characters limit conflicts with this. What is the solution?

Almost every day, a high rep user or moderator comes through, or you can "ping" one. If they agree, they'll make the edit. I finally have enough rep there now (the threshold is only 1,000) to help others, which I love to do!  This is a bigger site, and I don't know if it works the same way, so I'm not advocating it, just telling you my experience at GL.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*If there are only code tags and backticks  that are needed in the question* then you can consider adding a comment explaining the OP the need of them, until you get your edit applies immediately privilege.  Optionally, direct them to site's formatting help page.


















If the changes to be made are so minor that you can't find anything else to change, then just move on.

In my experience, there is rarely a post that needs edits where there is not more than six characters to fix. Even so, there are plenty of other posts that are in serious need of editing.

Once you get to 2000 reputation you won't have to worry about it.

All Stack Exchange sites are manned by the same company, and are run by essentially the same engine, with some additional per-site customizations like MathJax, etc. The new navigation is coming to all of them; this isn't really a subject for discussion.

New interface is being tested on SO first, since the guiding principle of the company is to figure out what developers need, and then provide that thing to others.

The help center for https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/commentWhen shouldn't I comment? states


  Compliments which do not add new information ("+1, great answer!"); instead, up-vote it and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-answerpay it forward;


which means comments like "thank you @XYZ" or "thanks, that's it" constitute as noise and hence, non-constructive.

Two of my flags for comment cleanup have been declined with no added explanation. Both of them were raised for completely non-constructive comments:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/hsOrn.png ,
https://i.stack.imgur.com/4jZfQ.png

The first comment was posted on my own answer by OP (answer already marked accepted). Regardless, why are they retained on the posts? 

I'm not yet aware that Community moderator bot can decline such flags so it is my assumption that a human moderator declined them. Why did they do that is  precisely what I want to know?

I should make it clear that my earlier similar flags were marked helpful and usually, all of the corresponding comments got deleted. The aforesaid ones seems to be exception here. That's why the title reflects: "haste or prudence".



Note: I, at the moment, do not find the need to link the posts behind the comments. Should the links be requested for better comprehensibility of the post, I may consider providing them. 

As for the moderators, those are the recent two comments declined against the reason 'not constructive', so you should be able to see them easily in my flag history.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Haste or Prudence: which one is it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The history shows that they were indeed declined by a mod, Bryan.  Hopefully he'll weigh in here.  I've cleaned them up.  You might want to flag such comments as "too chatty" instead, since they are not actively anti-constructive (which is how the flag tends to be interpreted).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps some background: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/169994/should-a-thank-you-comment-be-flagged. Also, my POV (as explained in some answers from there): 1 comment isn't so annoying/offending, especially if it's from new user, I wouldn't flag that. Instead, if there are a lot comments on a single post, that's when I'll flag the *post* with custom flag, requesting for comment clean-up (don't forget to explain the reason!). Anyway, that's my opinion only, and might not apply to other users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT., per the link it appears that if such a comment comes in the midst of a  discussion or useful comments, then it should be flagged as such (but with "too chatty" reason, as Matthew also suggested here). Otherwise, when they are the only ones on the post, since they do not seem to be offensive, one should not be bothered about them, neither should bother a mod for cleanup, but instead ask the poster not to post them. It reads like a sound advice and is in contrast to my current strict cleanup approach, but I'd like to wait for Bryan's explanation before jumping to the advice here.


















I want to buy a new android device and do not want to root it. But I need some functions. These functions can only be provided - on a non-rooted device if they are provided as system app.

So I end up with a quetion about  which veendor provides me with system apps, providiing the needed functions (app-data backup, local contacts, local calendar and autostart-manager). Is this completely off topic here,  or is there a stack-exchangee-site where this would be on topic?

On your point about not having this question on your site, *all Android phones comes with a full featured OS* (alike PCs you can't buy a new Android phone without the OS) and OP is looking for a hardware with specific software features.

I was making a slightly different point that questions specifically about vendors are off topic; the question in question (heh) has enough detail to be asking set a specific device.


















To enable better aspect ratios than that offered by Imgur's black magic offered in the previous answer, you could try using HTML tags like:

<img src="<image URL goes here>" width="<say 210>" height="<say 540>" alt="<alternate text in case the image does not display>" title="<some title text>"/>


I personally prefer this as the Imgur URL modifications mentioned above sometimes badly mess up aspect ratios of screenshots. This entails more effort than a modified link, but produces better results.

On Android Enthusiasts SE, there are half dozen questions relating to whether a mobile device while charging should be used for gaming, downloading etc. Answering a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/130000/is-power-consumed-from-battery-to-run-the-phone-when-chargingrecent question on this, I cited a technical resource  from "Battery University", to say that downloading when charging is not advisable. Subsequently, carried out https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6406/charging-a-smartphone-battery-while-using-ittests which support a larger perspective that even switching on the device is not recommended (link points to Electrical SE where I posted results to get more inputs-it has extracts from the technical resource as background)

These tests and conclusion stated , would be the the "what I researched or did " part of the question and the question itself would be on lines of "based on this tests and the technical resource , it is not advisable to charge with device on, are there reasons or grounds to the contrary" (haven't got down to the exact words , but that is the essence)

My concern is that the central point being "battery tests", some may view this as "Android Independent" and mark for closure. 

Whereas, I feel 

a) It has relevance to all Android users, which every device owner has to do (charging) and quite a few if not most switch the device on or use it while charging.

b) The tests do not require any hardware or specialised knowledge and are done using an app from Play Store.

c) this proposed question is not limited to which activity can be done or not as earlier questions addressed, but cover all activities including just switching the cell on.

I have put in a lot of effort in this and wouldn't like to see the question marked as Android Independent or Off Topic. I haven't found a similar question on meta, dealing with this kind of border line case, so request advice how to go about it

Thanks 

EDIT

I have received a mail from Battery University , in response to a request from me, and similarly from SE Electrical both pointing to my tests being incorrect or interpretations incorrect. To that extent, there is no need need to post now

However, I am not closing the question on my own, since the  concern raised merits decision on such cases being reviewed

Not to argue, but [Battery University](http://batteryuniversity.com/) offers knowledge on batteries independent of platform, and is quoted [10 times](http://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=battery+university) on our site. Going by your logic, one can well flag any of those for being "Android Independent?". All I intend(ed?) to post was one reference was Battery University, validated by tests and know if I am right or not, , on [similar lines](http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6406/charging-a-smartphone-battery-while-using-it) suitably amended.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know how closure voting works and I am not going to learn the hard way, so unless I get a clear OK from here will not post and risk wasting my time and effortb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I noticed that Battery University (BU) was used as an answer instead of question, so there's no problem with that. However, reading the underlying questions, IMHO *most of them* are Android independent (everything related to charging battery for the first time, because it applies to other devices).

Did [that](http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6406/charging-a-smartphone-battery-while-using-it), you can see the response in viewers and answers despite the bounty, which is irrelevant because I view it as a concern for all Android users and feel strongly that this deserves user community exposure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My concern is, are there more electronics experts on here compared to Engineering.SE or ElectricalEngineering.SE? Can your question be answered by us, Android experts, without relying public info on internet (compared to learnt knowledge on university)?

Select Settings -> SIM Management -> Turn on Data Roaming (or) on the notification slide (while sliding from the top) select APN Switch and then turn on Data roaming.   
Select Back. Select Access point names.   
Now you can able to view 4 options. Select Vodafone Connect and then press Add button (in the top right corner).  
Now you have to edit your settings.  
Click on Server (7th point). At default it shows Not set. Enter www.google.co.in. Select OK. 
Select Authentication type as Not set (13th Point).    
Select APN type as Not set (14th Point).     
Select APN Protocol as IPv4 (15th Point).   
Select APN Roaming Protocol as IPv4 (16th Point).   
Select Bearer as unspecified (18th Point).     
Select Menu/Settings. Select Save.  
Come back and select your preferred network type as WCDMA Only for 3G.    
Come back and select network operators and allow it select automatically or manually.   
Then it shows Vodafone In 3G. Select it. Then it shows Registered on network.  


Now restart/reboot your phone, and you're ready to operate your phone with your mobile data.

However, it doesn't answer the actual question. I'd really like a solution where Deepika gets to post the answer themselves.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with you,  but I don't know how to give a better answer to your question than merely providing a stopgap solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It'll probably require moderator intervention. I guess even moderators cannot convert a question into an answer. But they, and some high-rep users, should be able to un-protect a question - and then protect it again.

Within Stack Exchange network https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/Software Recommendations is what you need. Its https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp center notes:

This site is for questions asking for recommendations of software to accomplish a particular task, that is, “what software can I use to do …?”.

It further adds

Good software recommendation requests have two components:

A purpose — a task to accomplish, a user story
Some objective requirements — a minimum set of features


An asker there is supposed to follow the question quality guidelines laid down at https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-informationWhat is required for a question to contain “enough information”? It will let you understand what appropriate information should your question must have. Unclear question or info deliberately held down by asker (due to uncertainty often) makes a question good candidate for closure and/or downvote and/or it may not receive other users' attention, let alone helpful suggestions as comments or answers.
In case of further queries, use their https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/Meta. As expected, they also have an http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/12851/software-recommendationsofficial chat room with at least one moderator or an experienced user often available there. They may prove to be helpful if clarification may be too less of a thing to ask on meta.
As for the sites outside the Stack Exchange network, the answers here may help: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/371/96277Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?

Similar to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-android-devicethis question for information on how to root different devices, should a community wiki exist for whether the bootloader can be unlocked on different devices and how this is achieved?

Just thought it may gather information in one place.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should there be a community wiki for information about whether the bootloader can be unlocked on a particular device?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sounds good to me. If you do so, please do not forget to link to it from our `bootloader` tag wiki, so it's easily be found :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I'll go ahead and create a question. I have knowledge about a limited number of devices, so hopefully people can chip in what they know...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5They certainly will. We can deal with that as with the rooting one: Whenever a question turns up for a certain device not yet listed, link it from there. As with the rooting question, the (only) answer should contain nothing but links to the corresponding questions, and one such question allowed per device. Multiple questions for the same device getting closed as dupes. My 2 ¢ at least :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hmmm.... I'm slightly stuck as to what to put to start the question and answer... All I've got is a disclaimer. Do you have a better idea as of what to do?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Might I suggest using a pastebin (or some place for "collaborate editing"), then link to it from chat and continue there? For the disclaimer etc., you could also check the rooting tag-wiki. You might also consider waiting a little to get a few more opinions first; just me thinking it's a great idea doesn't exactly make a majority :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps leave it for a bit then and see what others think, especially seeing as I haven't got much of a clue as to what to do at then moment... Thanks for the infob2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd have a pretty clear idea about it (see my answer and upvote it if you agree / downvote if not). But we should wait for consent before starting anything.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Would you mind starting the community wiki if other people like this idea? Your answer seems like a good place to start; pretty similar to the rooting one but that's a good thingb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure thing, I'd do it. As it's a community wiki, I'd put up the question and start the answer – where you could chime in then and fill the gaps. Deal? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Sure. I'll add what I know.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's happening with this suggestion? Could someone possibly open a question with a community wiki answer so that people could add this information?


















We can deal with that as with https://android.stackexchange.com/q/1184/16575How do I root my Android device?:


collect existing questions, and link them from the answer – one per device
list should be ordered alphabetically, grouped by manufacturer
Whenever a question turns up for a certain device not yet listed, add the link
Whenever a question turns up for a device already listed, VTC as duplicate to the existing one


As with the rooting question, the (only) answer should contain nothing but links to the corresponding questions, and one such question allowed per device. Exceptions might be considered when a newer Android version requires a different approach.

PS: We should link to that question then from our https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bootloaderbootloader tag-wiki, to make it easy to find.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Per your suggestion, are we allowed to add those questions where OP asked for rooting method and got an answer which instructed bootloader unlocking? We don't receive many explicit bootloader unlocking questions, I believe.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I'd say everything giving the solution is valid. If the linked question is about rooting+unlocking, a comment next to the link could state that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's make sure that questions primarily about rooting are only included where there's explicit, detailed, obvious instructions about unlocking the bootloader. If there are then certainly, we should add that as a solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LJD200, that can be considered a possibility but we need to sketch it out on Meta, since  your expectation for *explicit, detailed, obvious instructions* would differ from mine and mine from Izzy's, and Izzy's from an another user and so on. Absence of clear guidelines would make things very unclear and may result in rolling back edits.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From the seeker's standpoint, "all information available" would be of interest. We could have 2 answers: One with *explicit, detailed, obvious instructions*, and another with *helpful but partly incomplete hints*. Explicit questions for "how to unlock" should not be closed as dupes to those "posts having some details as side effect to their main part" then. I.e., in the 2nd answer, there could be links to multiple posts per device.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Definitely would like to see it materialise.  Being "End user" site, by itself is reason to have this available, popularity of such query need not be a factorb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@beeshyams then upvote this answer :) That's how voting on Meta works: upvote = agree, downvote = disagree. Has nothing to do with rep here.


















I would say that if the person does not ask about the shopping but about the hardware, then it is off-topic because of recommendations. If there was a question like 


  I need a phone that matches the specified criteria


then I would say that it could have luck on http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.comHardware Recommendation. As long as it is not a question discussing price.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Please note that this discussion took place _long before_ either [softwarerecs.se] or [hardwarerecs.se] existed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did notice that it was 2010, but I suppose the answer I made could be of little use to future readersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question is about what is in scope for this site. It's not for where we might send people with the wrong kind of questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlE. I don't see any problem with this answer. Suggesting the correct site is better than leaving the asker nothing. I see that [hardwarerecs.se] accepts [Android devices](http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android),b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AlE. Even on old questions, we want up-to-date answers. Hardware Recommendations has become the obvious answer to this question.


















It's 2016 now, and we've https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/272563/were-standardizing-the-sidebar-width-at-300px-on-all-sitesmade some changes to the sidebar size. As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!

Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting Android apps
the site's twitter account
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2067here.

Answer is still the same: I can hardly keep up having my books up-to-date in German. So doing the same for translations won't be possible, sorry. Just this book is about 300 pages (in print format), to give you an idea. And thinking of the image size here: it's a book cover.

Anyhow, that's what it is. As the 5th print edition will be done by Wiley this spring (those who do the "Dummies" books as well), I'll ask them if they'd print an English version as well.

[Here's a link](https://i.imgur.com/ovDbpkU.jpg) to a higher-res image of the book cover :) Suggestion (by @Firelord) was to include some details on the book (price, "now at Amazon", or the like) instead of what's now at the right side. Fine with me: it's "Izzy's Android book in German, Kindle format, at Amazon, ~ EUR 5" :)

My proposal for such would be: Flags. Mods can convert answers to comments – and all those mentioned above IMHO should be comments rather than answers. Thus the info doesn't get lost, but quality isn't "downgraded". Additionally, a comment could be placed encouraging to make it a "full fledged answer, elaborating on the background and include missing details" (such as links, backing, etc). While converting an answer to a comment, there's an option to take the answer's comments along.

Even if the original answerer doesn't turn up to improve, someone else might (maybe even the OP if the hint helped solving the issue). It might as well happen that someone else turns up posting an answer based on that comment – and then the original answerer turns up complaining. In that case, tell that one "lesson learned" – do it properly next time, and you've got no reason to complain ;)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Out of all the moderators we have, one moderator was last seen months ago, one was seen last month and two of them were active this month on the meta site, per their profile page. Tell me please, assuming that your answer would gather 5 or more upvotes with no opposition from anywhere, *how do we know mods would consider this answer as a new rule?* Unless they themselves support this visibly, the confusion to whether comment and/or flag and which flag to use (NAA, VLQ or custom message) would remain profound for me and I assume so for other non-long-time users as well...continued..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...Can you please mention which flag do you recommend to be used? NAA might be declined unless as stated the mods know about this answer and agrees with it. VLQ - don't know how it would be handled. Only good hope I believe is a custom message where one would explain why the answer would better be converted to a comment than being retained as an answer. But that's really cumbersome, given that we do receive a good chunk of half-one-two line no-detailed answers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't base my answer on any activity profiles (if there's an issue as you indicate, that's a separate case) – but on my activities as moderator at SR. Hence my recommendation was "flag for mod attention" (last item in flags list), and as flag comment ask to convert.


















The question https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/134655/revisionshere (deleted; https://i.stack.imgur.com/sismQ.pngrecord) was migrated from Stack Overflow to our site. It was moved by a moderator of Stack Overflow and per the [currently deleted] comments there, the migration was proposed by a user using a flag. During my conversation with that moderator (say M1), I concluded that their site policy on migration doesn't respect the on-topic guidelines of destination site. http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/28241440#28241440From M1:

(https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6Z5U.pngRecord)


  Our current policy is to migrate content that has been requested to be migrated and let the destination site reject if it is not.


(The question https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/288901/4720957here doesn't have answers useful to my question. The answer https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/268722/4720957here has very good recommendation about migration but the view count of the page indicates that it may not be a policy accepted by many. Beyond them, I failed to find community consensus reflected in the noted quote. I can't confirm whether this is M1's personal policy or a policy privately or publicy created by all elected Stack Overflow's moderators or created through community's consensus.)

Let me simplify the quote. It is not their business to find whether the post would be on-topic on the destination site. If the post is not on-topic to them and a migration has been requested, they would throw the post on destination site and latter has to deal with whatsoever comes to them, including but not limited to crap i.e. purely worthless stuff.

Any  moderator of a site is a representative of that site to other network sites and the outside world. By the very nature of the authority they handle, a moderator would and should know all that is needed to run the site (that includes sound understanding of migration) and is alone in a position to define what is good for the site and what's not, to a certain extent of course. So if I (a user from the network), hear from a site's moderator, anything about a policy of their site then I've no reason to disregard their word. Correct?

Let's come back to the issue now. In the midst of 2014, a trusted user of our site https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/265849/4720957requested users from Stack Overflow to not migrate posts which are already off-topic to us. It was https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/265851/4720957answered by a Stack Overflow's moderator with the following reason with regard to the  localized issue of that question:


  Not entirely sure why, or why a moderator accepted that, but that's what started this. We usually decline these flags, so this is probably just an honest mistake.


Given that quote, the policy M1 uses may have been framed up after Jun 16, 2014. Please comment the link if you know where the policy is.

From FAQ for Stack Exchange sites: https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/10250/286110What is migration and how does it work?


  Things to consider when migrating questions
  
  
  Don't migrate crap! Ever. If the question is likely to be closed on the destination site anyway, don't bother migrating it. Just close it normally and advise the OP of the other site in the comments. If they decide to improve the question, then they can go post it over there, or they can edit their question and have it migrated later.
  Avoid migrating answered questions. The point of migration is to send the question to a place where it is on-topic and can get answered. If the OP already has an answer, then we've already defeated the purpose of migration and the destination site won't have anything to do with the question. Avoid migrating these questions unless they are of extremely good quality and risk deletion on their current site.
  Don't migrate for the sake of migration. We only migrate questions because they are off-topic on the original site. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. As a general rule, if someone asks a question here, and it's on-topic here, it should stay here.
  Be familiar with the destination site. If you have never even visited the destination site before, read through the FAQ thoroughly and make sure the question actually belongs there. Don't look at the name of a site and automatically assume the question can be asked there. Each site has its own rules, and rules vary greatly across sites.
  If you're not sure, don't migrate it. Let someone else who is sure do that, or ask for opinions from the community in a relevant chat room.
  


Use the migrated question with the quoted FAQ and the following is what you get:


Don't migrate crap!: It was https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicoff-topic and completely of no use to an end-user, hence crap to us.
Avoid migrating answered questions.: It was already answered on source site. Furthermore, per the first point, the question was not in a position to get answers on our site, let alone helpful ones.
Don't migrate for the sake of migration.: It  was flagged for migration by user(s) and later closed as off-topic by M1 when it was and still is https://stackoverflow.com/posts/34866948/revisionson-topic to them (https://i.stack.imgur.com/fHOTp.pngrecord). 

Thankfully, our site's moderator showed concern for the author. He appropriately handled the question on our site and later voted to reopen it on Stack Overflow.
Be familiar with the destination site.: Given the actions, I don't think anyone involved in migration of that question alone, from Stack Overflow to our site, appears to have correct understanding or awareness on what is not to be posted on our site. 

What's more painful to know is that that they're actually advising us on  how to handle their garbage. For their information: We already know how do deal with garbage! Why tell us what we already know?

http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/28225913#28225913From M1 (https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6Z5U.pngrecord):


  [Flag] or vote to close the post as off topic. Once it's closed, it'll reject the migration. That's how the workflow is handled. 

If you're not sure, don't migrate it.: Do I now even have to explain this one?




Per the system, I'm neither an experienced user, nor a trusted user or a moderator, so I cannot hope to raise my issue (follow M1's http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/28241440#28241440suggestion, that is) on Meta Stack Overflow since the issue I perceive is a community's issue not my personal one. 

Thus, regardless of your reputation points, if you find my issue substantive, the defense put forward strong and appropriate without ad hominem attack against anyone involved, then by all means:


please remind Stack Overflow that we're a small site with https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/578/96277much smaller number (still relevant) of active close voters and that we already have https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1495/96277huge and unavoidable issue with regard to development/programming questions posted here almost every single day 
that, given the first point, we're not in a good position to handle, but regardless neither do we intend to handle extra garbage 
that they should dispose their garbage in their own territory and because their policy forces us to handle their own garbage which is a burden on us and completely unjustifiable, that we kindly request  an exception to our site in their migration policy - the same policy briefly hinted by M1. 


Caution: before you post on Meta Stack Overflow, please make yourself https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/265849/could-you-not-migrate-programming-questions-to-android-se-please#comment63310_265849aware of this attitude which is nothing but a more shortened version of the policy I heard from M1:


  Can't you just reject the migration?




Just so you know, after the conversation (read: disappointing) with M1, I've started wondering  whether I should change my stance here: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1998/96277Should development questions be put on hold or migrated to SO?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we remind our beloved Stack Overflow not to throw garbage on us?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"including but not limited to crap" is the hard one here – and yes, I've heard that argumentation before (about "let the target deal with it"). Granted, SO has a much higher load than we have. But if they can't cope with that, putting the load on their sister-sites is the wrong way – the right way would be approaching staff asking for re-inforcements, have an election, and end up with additional mods to deal with the high load. So I'm with you: Sure we could "just reject", but it shouldn't come here in the first point. We're not elected "SO housekeepers" (with all due respect) ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seeing that this case happened because of a single binding moderator vote, I'm afraid the issue is actually on the migration process itself. I agree the onus is on the flagger & voter, but it's hard to make people behave to what the community wants. Instead, I'm blaming the migration process itself. I *thought* there's migration queue that 10k/mods could approve/reject on the target site, but it appears to be wrong (there's only *list of recent migrated posts* on admin/mod tools). If only [this feature](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/149825) was implemented...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT.: Is that a comment from a regular SO user or a regular Android.SE user? :) (*pun intended*) I had this thought of proposing a technical fix but I dropped it while framing the question since not much has been done to remind them with our problem and if they are not reminded then they might not bother for a fix (such as the proposed fix you linked). And the biggest problem I see is that *the representative of that community* uses the process wrongly and does not see that *they are forcing destination site to deal with their mess*. This can't be fixed by any technical means.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Aww, I'm a trusted user. That's the nicest thing anyone's called me all day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme: You and other veterans who have posted such incredibly conceptual and useful answers on main site are the primary reason I decided to contribute and stay on main site. And I've mostly learned (good or bad) from the actions of all the long-time users.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5`Can't you just reject the migration?`  Can't they just *not migrate*?  I don't throw my trash on my neighbor's lawn and then tell them to just clean it up.  SuperUser appears to have the same attitude as this SO moderator, and it sucks.  IMO if they can't be bothered to check whether they *should* migrate, they should definitely not bother to migrate at all.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead: thanks for your input. Yes, I'm also aware of [su]'s attitude and we've received crap from them in quite a number in last few months (perhaps it has been always like that). That said, I didn't bring this up because I remember Izzy once raised this issue to an [su] moderator in their moderator only chat room so I though that might have been enough.


















Izzy flagged this asking for a canonical answer, and I just declined a couple flags on such posts so I thought I would weigh in again.

The length of a post does not determine its quality as an answer.

Yes, it's strongly correlated with poor answers.  But some questions only require short answers.  Your concern should be whether it answers the question — not with whether it could easily fit into the comment space.

If a question is answerable by bad one-liners, you should also consider whether it's the question itself that is problematic (but again, it's just a correlation).

Beyond that I can't say too much concretely.  It's a subjective and, as noted in the question, experience-based determination.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I can say "yes" to every single point you say in your answer here, Matthew – IMHO you've forgotten one most important issue with those "short answers": Do they contain ***enough*** information to ***really answer*** the question – or do they only give a "raw direction"? Taking the example on top, to me it's the latter. It might be an answer *to me* (I am deeply involved with Android) – but to my dad it'd mean asking 2 new questions: "What is Exposed/Gravity box", "where to find" (spelling error intentional). => it's a lazy comment, not an answer. But can be salvaged in *this* example.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy But it doesn't become not-an-answer by virtue of appealing to advanced users.  Lazy answers are worth downvotes, and with enough of them high-rep users can vote to delete, but mods are discouraged from removing them outright.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can see that for "outright" (i.e. if you just "stumble upon them"). I however see it a bit different when you get to see it for a flag was risen. Especially with multiple flags ;)


















How does the questions limited to the scope of a nightly build of a ROM are helpful to site in long-run?

There are questions we receive that are more or less specific to a nightly build of a ROM. (In case one has never heard the term nightly build outside the scope of Android, I recommend reading wiki of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_buildDaily build.) By specific, I meant examples like the following ones:


https://android.stackexchange.com/q/134711/96277CM13 on Nexus 9: Any app that internally opens a webpage or otherwise uses System WebView crashes (https://i.stack.imgur.com/8O3Qy.pngrecord)

https://android.stackexchange.com/q/135350/96277https://android.stackexchange.com/q/135350/96277 (https://i.stack.imgur.com/Okvwx.pngrecord)

https://android.stackexchange.com/q/101368/96277Installed CM12 on Sprint Galaxy S4, GAPPS crashing upon start (https://i.stack.imgur.com/snKTa.pngrecord)
and the list https://android.stackexchange.com/search?page=1&tab=newest&q=%22nightly%22%20is%3aquestiongoes on..


If I've to give a brief of those examples, I would say: 


individual or all apps crashes or gives ANR messages intermittently or repeatedly
any or all of mobile data, Wi-Fi and bluetooth does not work
encryption does not work correctly
screen blackouts during usage, including but not limited to calls
navigational button stops working
the famous boot-loop or "optimizing apps" at startup followed by a reboot and repetition of same cycle
texts not sent or received


A nightly is:


a ROM in progress, updates often and users are supposed to use the latest version;
supposed to be not used as a daily driver (a fact folks ignore), hence, ideally not meant for any user but for a tester who takes risk of losing their data;
expected to have bugs which may or may not be severe, but in any case it is expected that users report bugs whenever encountered so that the latter gets fixed ASAP before a stable build for  all end-users is released. 


While nothing stop the issues mentioned in my example cases to occur on stock ROMs or stable builds of custom ROMs, the likelihood of occurrence of them is greater on nightly builds and are often solved in a next build or some other build in near future once reported to ROM's developers. As such, while we may not be losing anything by keeping such questions, I ask again: 


What long-term benefit does the site have from those questions?
Is there a problem you also see or have I exaggerated the issue?
As the title asks, what do you recommend for dealing with such questions, other than commenting?


Do note that nightly builds are updated at a faster pace. Possibility of a solution for a bug in a next release is also high if developer is aware of the issue. Once the next build fixes the issue, the question loses almost all of its usefulness. 

This reminds me of the http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/problem with shopping recommendations where the information definitely becomes obsolete in a matter of few months, if not weeks as in case of nightly builds here.

I noticed that the  criteria of https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/5222/286110automatic deletion of a question isn't much helpful here. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Recommendation for questions pertaining to a problem specific to a nightly build of a ROMb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Issues with nightlies should be dealt with like the same with beta versions. Who opts in for testing should report to the devs. And I fully agree: those posts won't be relevant for long.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe I'm getting old but I don't remember this being brought up before, well done.  I see no reason to entertain any questions about bugs in nightlies, I think we should flag and close them.  I'd like input from more people though before I go on a rampage.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While we're at it, how about [tag:developer-preview] ROM? Should we add another off-topic close reason for these kind of questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Since my suggestion was the highest-voted, I've gone ahead and created a CW question and answer http://android.stackexchange.com/q/147830/12442 to dup questions to.


















I think you're right that these questions add no value to the site. They're almost never fixable by users, and we do seem to get a lot of them. I've tried to reduce their number in the past by adding to the cyanogenmod tag-wiki a note about nightlies and about how to get bugs fixed faster; also by adding a comment like "don't use nightlies" to such questions.

I'd be in favour of a "canonical" CW question of the form "I have problems using a nightly/unstable build of this ROM; what can I do about it?", with an answer that (a) suggests how to report bugs, and how to help out mod authors in other ways, and (b) tells you not to use nightlies on a phone you actually want to use. All these questions would be duped to this canonical question. I'd even be happy to write the question and answer, if the community agrees with this solution.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do you aim for a post with multiple answers or a single coherent answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord A single CW answer, like the question. Is there a reason there would be more than one answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think this is a good solution, although I personally also have no problem with just outright banning them. This however has the benefit of not requiring us to petition SE for an additional close reason in the dialog (3 is the max by default, and we are using all 3).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis I just flagged [this Nightly build question](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/140392/nexus-4-on-cm-13-nightly-download-problem) off-topic for "trying to find an off-site resource" because "these types of answers become obsolete quickly". Am i correct in flagging it in that manner?


















Every now and then we see some questions of very low quality. The question is 70% venting and/or panic and begging and include no information about the device itself or the Android version.

We have https://android.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askhow do I ask a good question but let's face it, most newcomers don't read such stuff, even the https://android.stackexchange.com/tourtour.

Even though I know it won't one hundred percent prevent such things, I think placing a pre-formatted template shadow question might be useful for new and noob users. We already use this method at the https://i.stack.imgur.com/4GKDq.pngprofile parts of our user pages which -in my opinion- needs it much less than the question page.

I'm no psychologist but since people come with the intention of being walked through, I think this can be a way to guide them to ask better formatted questions and thus raise the general quality average of questions.

For example something like this:

Your problem: My phone is stuck on a bootloop after rooting with Kingoroot.

Things you tried so far: I tried to boot into recovery however I failed. 

I don't know what else to do


Your phone and Android version: LG G4 with Android M

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Adding a template question to the Ask Question boxb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The `What's your Android question?  Be specific.` guidance in the title field is probably insufficient, I agree.  The body field could definitely use one asking for what they've tried and device details.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead Thank you. I have actually seen plenty of users with low reps that modified their profiles according to the basic template (including myself). So I actually think that people tend to follow that and it might be useful to raise the general quality.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5About that template, [here](http://meta.softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/890/14045) is a good argument that you should consider. I'm fine, however, with a template asking only for Android version, model and root status.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I actually target to have people know *what they should include in their question* rather than enforcing a certain format. Some people don't know what information is relevant to their problem. Some don't even know what information they can/should provide us with. Since people are more likely to accept suggestions when confused, a template might give them the basic idea faster than any other thing, make them generate a high quality question that'll help them solve their problem and be a good addition to our site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I believe that this would help newcomers know what to put into their question, so that we can help them in  a much quicker time frame. But my question is will user take this up or just ignore it?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can this be only active below a certain rep limit? Say  15 rep? More experienced users shouldn't be affected by this, as it would just waste time for them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should this be active just for people without the Informed badge rather than below a rep figure?  Also, put something similar in the answer box - look at the number of "Me too" and "Have you found the answer yet?" posts we get.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SarpSTA That is way better, then I Original thought,  can't try the features out as am on phone at the moment, but visual ly it looks good, one suggestion, maybe, is to add a question Mark next to some of the box's , telling the user where they can find the info E.g Where to find the device model  (although this maybe limited to only people with no knowledge at all of where to find that info). All in all, I be live that this should be implemented on this siteb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Matt07211 I decided to post it as an answer and leave the question itself untouched since Firelord suggested so. If you want to check it out, you can find it in the answer :) Thanks for the positive feedback! I also changed the link to the example since the old sandbox didn't support some HTML functions. I added a JSFiddle link. Check it from there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@SarpSTA hopes that this gets implemented


















There are rare cases where one has to (or "strongly wants to") reach out to a mod directly/personally. I understand (and want to emphasize!) these should be exceptions, and a mod should not be forced into it – but still, such cases exist (in my 3.5+ years here on Android.SE I felt in that situation 2 times – and you know I'm quite active here; this should show the exception of the need). So how can that be achieved?


on many/most other sites, there's at least one mod available in the site's chat room (or was shortly, so (s)he can be @ pinged). Not so on Android.SE: I cannot remember when I last saw one of our mods in our room. Must be at least 2 years ago.
being a mod myself, I of course know about TL. Unfortunately, same situation there; and in some cases one doesn't want to @@ there (or address all mods), to keep the ball low (e.g. now dirty laundry in public ;). There's the possibility to create a "private chat room" and invite – but I'm not sure if that's reserved for mods.
in some cases, a @ ping doesn't even require a direct response (example: having flagged a question for mod attention, and wanting to add some (important) details forgotten: a second flag isn't permitted by the system, so a simple @ in chat might do)
we've got no such thing as PM on SE


So let me put my question into separate bullet points:


Wouldn't it be a good idea if at least one of the mods can be found in our chat room? What speaks against it? If it's your (the mods) workload, you know you can ask for reinforcement. I then might even volunteer and nominate myself to fulfill my own request :)
Do you rather "keep out of reach" for a reason – or, put into other words, is it generally "unwanted" on SE to reach out to a mod this way?


This is nagging me for the better of a year now. Thus, unable to reach you otherwise, I've decided to bring it up here on Meta (which should be the right place, especially as I'm certainly not the only one with this question in mind).

Please don't get me wrong: this is not a rant, nor am I wanting to blame/accuse someone (some of us have a real-life outside SE as well, unbelievable as it might sound, so there's definitely the possibility of a good reason ;) But having background and advice on this topic pointed out clearly (whichever direction) will certainly be of help.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to reach out to a mod on Android.SE?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't know that any of us are intentionally trying to "stay out of reach". I personally don't sit in chat because I simply don't use it (I guess I'm not very chatty?). However, I wouldn't be opposed to perhaps having a separate room that one (or more) of us could just idle in, specifically so that people can ping us for mod-related questions. A few other sites to this. SU, for example, has [Ask a Super User Moderator](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/114/ask-a-super-user-moderator).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks, @eldarerathis – and yes, such a room would be a good compromise indeed (keeping you from being "flooded", while still enable us to "reach out"). Might even be enough if it's not "widely announced" but known to the "most active users", who could then act as intermediaries. That would be my 2nd choice if none of you want to join the regular room regularly (oops). As I wrote, I can think of reasons why you might want that, and you have my full respect in that regard :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Keeping conversations related specifically to site moderation in a separate room kind of makes sense anyway, IMHO. It'll keep the noise down and then people won't have to talk over other conversations when trying to get help from one of the mods. The only real downside is that it's not private, but you could at least ping a mod there and request a private chat if the situation warranted it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Full ack, @eldarerathis (though noise level is rarely high in our regular chat room), sounds good to me – and whoever agrees please upvote that comment ;) If we go that way (don't foget to make each of you room owner there then, so the room doesn't suddenly "drop out"), it might be a good idea to announce it (with link) in an answer here. Title of the question is clear for that, and there are not so many questions tagged `moderators` that it would be too hard to find (but it's still "covered enough" to keep most unwanted noise out). Thanks again – and in advance!


















Several of the mods hang out frequently in http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25/android-enthusiaststhe chatroom.  You can feel free to talk to us there for any sort of "extended discussion" regarding the site or moderation.  Specific questions should be posted here on Meta.

If your issue relates to something you'd like to discuss privately, you're welcome to ping us to try to arrange a private chat rather than directly discussing it in the public room.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good start. I want to know something however. If a user posts something in that chat room without using @ to notify a particular mod and the chat room is not opened in a browser's tab of any of the moderator, would you moderators be notified that a comment has been posted in that chat room *or* would you have to develop a habit of checking that room regularly to see if something has been posted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you don't @ping someone then no notification will be generated. If you do then we'll get a notification in our network-wide inbox. Also, it may be worth noting for anyone who does not frequent chat: you can `@`ping multiple people in a single message (unlike comments).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another thing worth noting: pings in chat work only for users who have been in the room __recently__. (Off the top of my head, I think "recently" means the past two weeks, but don't hold me to that.) If they haven't been in the room in over two weeks, you can still type out their names in ping format, but they will __not__ get notifications.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The mod-questions-chatroom has been fairly inactive and ultimately got frozen automatically, so I don't think there's enough action to keep it going.  Since Dan and Izzy were elected and they're constantly in the regular room (and I've been in there more too recently), I think it's best if users ping us there instead.  Users in that room have been pretty good about not talking over more "on-topic" discussions.  I edited the answer accordingly.

A lot of questions are posted in which there is a bare minimum of information and someone almost always comments and says to add details such as Android device, Android version, etc. This fine but it would be better if these details were present in the first place.
Is there some way in which we could make it clear to users that they should add these details if required when they ask a question?
The How To Ask guide in the Help Center says:

Be specific
If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.

Which is true but perhaps it could specify which details users could include. I understand that there isn't a single list of details that suit every question, which is why the detail list could include suggestions or examples. Many questions would benefit from these general details and too much detail is never a bad thing.
Of course, we can never guarantee that users will actually read the Help Center pages (see https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1302/when-asking-a-question-enforce-user-to-read-the-faq-firstthis question) so maybe a different approach to this issue would be better.

I felt like the idea is found appealing. But little to no contribution is made so I decided that I must visualize the idea so we can brainstorm on a more tangible project. 

What I suggest is instead of the classic title+body question form format we have right now, a new member will find a different format where the form is divided into different parts. Also, there will be an option to deactivate this suggested new format and activate the classic format instead, however this option will be available only if the user is above a certain reputation (in my opinion 15 reputation would suffice, since that is when a user gets to upvote which means the community trusts this user is able to tell a good post from a bad one.) 

You can see http://jsfiddle.net/SarpSTA/qeLepvyp/an example of this idea here.

I chose this approach based on comments like these:


  The What's your Android question? Be specific. guidance in the title
  field is probably insufficient, I agree. The body field could
  definitely use one asking for what they've tried and device details. –
  Matthew Read♦


I agree and it was already a part of my initial idea so I implemented it on the example.


  I believe that this would help newcomers know what to put into their
  question, so that we can help them in a much quicker time frame. But
  my question is will user take this up or just ignore it? – Matt07211


By forcing this reputation limit we are making sure that they won't be able to deny it.  


  Can this be only active below a certain rep limit? Say 15 rep? More
  experienced users shouldn't be affected by this, as it would just
  waste time for them. – Tamoghna Chowdhury


Agreed and a supported idea.


  Should this be active just for people without the Informed badge
  rather than below a rep figure? Also, put something similar in the
  answer box - look at the number of "Me too" and "Have you found the
  answer yet?" posts we get. – Chenmunka


I thought reputation is better because you don't need to actually read the tour to get the informed badge. Just holding down on page down button does the job.

Post a two liner one time, make two edits with correcting tags or title and there you go with 15 points. // System trusts you at 125 points with the privilege to vote down to tell what is bad and not with 15 to tell what's good only. // The problem with the example is that all the sites runs more or less the same SE engine. *You're asking for too much work* with that example.

I literally thought the same about the 125 rep thing but I thought it was too high. But now, I actually think 125 is better since it includes users from other sites with +100 bonus too. For the engine, I don't know about it. If it can't be modified then we can't ask for magic. But I don't agree that it is too much work. It took me 15 minutes to shape it.

In this case, 'prevention is better than cure'. On Stackoverflow, upon trying to submit a question, the editor is smart enough to realize there's more code snippets than text.

With that approach in mind, how about, upon asking the question, expressions like 'Unstable', 'Nightly', 'CyanogenMod' (or other custom ROMs with nightlies) in same sentence/paragraph are flagged, then a prompt appears pointing the asker to learn more about questions relating to nighlies.

I think its much easier stopping them in their tracks with such a hint. With that prompt, should an asker proceed to post nightlies related question(s), it becomes obvious the post needs to be deleted, and should be.

Edit

Hint might look like this:

However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out.

You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature.

Thank you!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You appear to have a propensity for posting self-answered questions that link to your site/blog.

I would wager that this was a significant factor here.


















In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Q&A with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.


  The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2120/2016-moderator-election-qa-questionnairehere.


Here's how it'll work:


During the nomination phase, (so, until Monday, March 21st at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 pm EDT on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post one question per answer.
We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.
This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.
At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.
Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.
This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&A.


If you have any questions or feedback about this process, feel free to post as a comment here.

I was hoping to see a post or at least a brief of it in this post on why this decision for election has been *suddenly* considered given that this post isn't very old: [Why aren't there any more elections?](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/2054)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I don't know that SE generally provides advance notice/explanation for mod elections. At least, I don't recall it happening in the past.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis : alright, so they literally prefer to give *a surprise*. Cool!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I guess so. You're definitely not the first person to [be surprised by an election](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/742/2011-community-moderator-election#comment1146_742). In this case, the mod team knew something was coming (we were asked if we wanted additional help) but I don't believe anyone was given dates.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Elections tend to be a sort of "Okay, these are the sites that still need elections right now, what can we schedule this week?" sort of deal. What's picked is based on the urgency of the call plus how long it's been since the call was made. I did actually schedule this a week in advance (plus the ones that would be starting this week on other sites), but that was less overt and more of an internal memo to self on what my weekly agenda included.


















Like every other site, we also suffer from lazy answers. The problem has been discussed here: https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2032/96277Half line answers -- what would be the best course of action(s) to deal with them? The problem is different from https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/57/96277this issue which is about lazy guesses or lazy opinions.
None of the solutions to the original problem have gained support (through votes) that can be considered as will of the community at large. 

Consider the fact that no consensus causes or may be causing ambiguity to mortals from flagging those posts -  mortals, who are the major reason moderators are able to keep the site clean or keep a tab on quality of posts. 

Since there is no denying that there exists a major problem to deal with,

Their answer, diplomatic it may be, would and should be used for judging their stance on the issue rather than originally limiting them in the question.   Voters are requested to review the question again.


















https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cloudcloud and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/deletedelete are frequently meta-ish tags: They're just words pulled from the question, rather than the useful categories that we want tags to be.

My view is that various cloud services have virtually nothing in common, so having a tag to group them all serves no purpose.  It's better to use specific tags like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dropboxdropbox, for example.

Izzy thought some combinations were useful, like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cloudcloudhttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printingprinting or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cloudcloudhttps://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/backupbackup.  I think those combinations are potentially useful categories, but would be better represented by a single tag like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cloud-printingcloud-printing.  There's not really a use case for filtering by https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cloudcloud, since https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printingprinting and https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/backupbackup have in common; you wouldn't even use the same cloud service for both.

Visiting a question page (any question) without logging in, I see a strange yellow stripe. It does not look like an intended design element.

I "am" interested in nominating for the mod election, but I feel that I don't have all the necessary experience yet. (My plan is to become more experienced over the months so I can nominate in the next election cycle, whenever that may be.)

Izzy's answers


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Friendly, of course – as I always try to do :) Exact action of course depends on the case (what kind of flags? what causes them?). Following an analysis, I'd seek a personal word with him, together finding a solution/plan hopefully fitting all.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


As far as I've heard, there's a secret chamber for such cases. I'd see him there. Someone closes the door behind us – and we talk that over. Door will be opened if one of us is convinced.

Honestly: I was referring to the mods' chat room. I'd ask him there. Maybe he'd "missed a point" or I did. What I'd never do is simply reverting his action – that would be his task (unless he delegates it).


  
  We have a significant problem where a question lacks some critical details - the details required to formulate a good answer, absence of which may restrict few users from considering posting a detailed answer. Those details are usually the Android version and Android device name, but not limited to them. Consider the fact that users often have to invest/waste their time into seeking those details - the details, which should have been provided by the user already or could have been asked from them via technical means. There exists clearly a problem to deal with, so... What stance do you have on this issue? What do you propose or have proposed to deal with this issue?
  


As I've done in the past, I'd leave a comment indicating the missing details. Depending on how big the gap is, being a mod I'd additionally put it "on hold" as "being unclear". Especially for new users, I'd add to my comment that updating the post with the missing details and a "ping" to my person would be a quick way to get it re-opened again. No pun intended, but that should add weight to the comment (and engrave the fact in memory ;)


  
  Moderators are given the power to unilaterally delete posts. Given this ability, how would you approach answers that are objectively low-quality (vague, short, etc) but are an attempt to provide an answer?
  


Depends on. But in most cases I'll probably convert them to comments – while leaving a note (comment) on the original (then deleted) "answer" why I did so, and how to improve the post. For re-open etc. see previous question: My intention is never to punish, but rather to "enforce" quality while keeping useful information.


  
  Are there any existing policies or rules that you think should be amended or removed? Are there any new policies you would like to see added?
  


{to be filled with a later edit}


  
  You close a question that's clearly off-topic and the user comes to Meta, not to ask what they did wrong, say you're a [mean word here]. How do you react?
  


Being a coward, I'd ask one of my co-mods to close that Meta post (if it's off-topic anyway) or edit it (otherwise), keeping myself out. We don't need "personal vendettas" here – and I feel that would be the best way avoiding such.


  
  Even though we've a clear consensus on https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1984/96277Should users (non-Moderators) approve an edit made by a user posing as the author of the post? you can still find two or three regular reviewers who do not go by that consensus and wrongly approve such edits. Other problem is with reviewing where careless or superfluous edits gets approved, most likely to increase review count. How do you deal with such reviewers or with their reviewing? If you don't see a problem, please tell us why do you not find such reviews a problem at all.
  


I've not much experience in this field, but I'd try to contact them (eg. by "drawing" them into a private chat) to explain. Just remembering one comparable case from the past, I can imagine convincing them hunting for some other trophy (badge, that is), and keep the ball lower here – if it looks like "badge hunting", that is.

Consider the fact that no consensus causes or may be causing ambiguity to users from flagging those posts - users, who are the major reason moderators are able to keep the site clean or keep a tab on quality of posts. What are you going to do with answers similar in nature to the examples listed in that question? What clear suggestion for dealing with those posts do you propose for ordinary users of this site?
  


Smells like #3, just for answers, mixed with #4 – so my approach would be similar here. As I've already suggested https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/posts/2073/editin my answer to that post, I'd encourage users to flag such posts (low quality), and as mod deal with them as described in #4: convert to comment, leave a reason, hope for the user to improve the post. If the latter happens in appropriate form, immedialy restore the answer.


  
  If you're a regular here, you would have soon realized that we have a huge quite an issue of crappy migration from one of the larger SE sites. That site deals with questions posted by enthusiasts and power users of computers. What is your stance on crappy migration? Do you have a preemptive solution? If yes, what is it? What do you suggest to regular flag raisers and close voters to do with such crap?
  


I've already been involved with this issue. Where possible, I'd seek out the mods of the corresponding origin site asking them to stop it. They are not always able to, e.g. if our site is a "regular target" and 5 users vote to migrate. In those cases I suggested them to "educate" their users. Migrated "crap" I'd immediately "return to sender" (aka "reject migration" – but don't nail me on a definition of "crap", as that's "primarily opinion based" :)

Of course this means I'd encourage users to flag such posts. And please don't forget I'm not the only mod (if elected, that is) – so this presents my opinion. If the majority of the mod team has a different stance, I'd seek agreement first.


  
  How do you define https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1997/96277Android independent questions? The only available answer to the linked question doesn't seem to solve the original problem stated in the question. https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2110/7088Some extra thinking material can be found in the original question.
  


That's a tricky one to answer "canonically". There are some questions where it's clear (e.g. "repair the glass of device X", or "clearly carrier-related issues"), some that are border-line, and some where that's pretty much opinion-based. In dubio pro reo for one, and some specifics for another (anyone tell me how handling a LiIo battery is not Android-independent? Still I agree this is an important topic for all Android users, so I see why we even have a tag for that. We don't deal with the "glass repair" though, as that doesn't even affect a majority). This one I cannot give a clear answer, but will have to decide per-case.

  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


I'd try to find out why the comments are so controversial and try to engage him in the ideal of keeping the site friendly. We don't have enough awesome answerers for the number of questions we have, so I wouldn't want to lose one, but we're fortunate at present that all of our good answerers work together well, even when we disagree. I think having that culture here makes it less likely that we'll have to face this kind of tricky situation.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


It depends. If it were a simple mistake (say, closing as duplicate against another question with a similar title but completely different content), I'd just talk to them (in mod chat) and establish the facts. It's just as likely to be my mistake or misunderstanding as theirs. Once we've reached a shared understanding, then we could decide together what corrective action to take.

If it were a matter of policy disagreement instead, such as closing a question that's borderline, I'd just accept the decision. We don't have to all agree about every question. If it becomes a recurring theme then I'd open a question on meta, in general terms rather than about the specific posts, to establish the community's consensus on the issue, and then try to get all the mods to abide by that.


  
  We have a significant problem where a question lacks some critical details [...] What stance do you have on this issue? What do you propose or have proposed to deal with this issue?
  


In the short-term, we need to keep up our campaign of commenting to ask for more details and closing when necessary. I think it's important to show the OP that we're not just complaining about their post: we ask for more details because that's how we will solve their problem.

Going forward, we need to find a way to improve this situation.  We need to start by getting data on how many questions are like this, so that we can evaluate whatever solutions we try. My first idea would be to add some text to the "ask question" page to show users what information we expect: like you get on a bug reporting system. But that's something we need to go cap-in-hand to SE to ask for. Regardless of what we choose, if we can keep track of how many poor questions we're getting, we can try different ideas and find out which ones are effective.

I'd include app development questions in this category too. At least they're easier to spot and deal with when they do come up, but despite everything we've done so far to discourage them, we still get a handful per day. I think it's time to consider what the next step could be.


  
  Moderators are given the power to unilaterally delete posts. Given this ability, how would you approach answers that are objectively low-quality (vague, short, etc) but are an attempt to provide an answer?
  


I'm going to take this question together with:


  
  Like every other site, we also suffer from lazy answers. [...] What are you going to do with answers similar in nature to the examples listed in that question? What clear suggestion for dealing with those posts do you propose for ordinary users of this site?
  


I'd approach them the same way I do now. On the whole, I don't believe in deleting good-faith attempts to answer, even if they're unhelpful or lazy. Downvoting is an appropriate action for low-quality answers, but sometimes it's possible to edit and improve them to the point where they're high-quality. I believe that ending up with a high-quality answer on the site is a good outcome, regardless of who gets the rep. Editing to improve also helps the lazy answerer to see what we expect from answers on the site.

I'd like to take this opportunity to encourage users to do that more often, whether they're moderators or not. I know it sometimes feels like too much effort, but even if you only improve one extra answer, if we all do that we'll have a lot more good answers on the site.


  
  Are there any existing policies or rules that you think should be amended or removed? Are there any new policies you would like to see added?
  


I would like to see the app recommendation close reason removed. To my mind, the reason to disallow app recommendations is for questions like "What email app should I use?" which are opinion-based. We should keep closing questions like that. But I see a lot of questions closed which are of the form "I want to [automatically feed my cats with my smartphone]. Is there an app for this?" To my mind, that isn't a recommendation question, it's about solving a problem. Obviously the questioner would assume that the answer is an app, but more often than not they would be just as happy with a non-app answer (most commonly, some Tasker profile). I don't like to see those questions closed just because the questioner used the magic word "app".

When people ask actual recommendation questions, we'd close them as opinion-based, or too broad. If a question asks for an app but isn't opinion-based or too broad, why would we want to close it?


  
  You close a question that's clearly off-topic and the user comes to Meta, not to ask what they did wrong, say you're a [mean word here]. How do you react?
  


I'd let somebody else handle it. If the user has taken it personally, then any attempt by me to explain will make it about me vs. them, making the situation worse. If another moderator, or even better, a respected member of the community who isn't a moderator, can make a reassuring post, then it shows that a moderator is someone who acts out the will of the community, not just some kind of dictator. Of course, if it were a mistake on my part, or if the community consensus is to reverse my decision, I would answer the meta post myself. You can't delegate apologizing.


  
  Even though we've a clear consensus on https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1984/96277Should users (non-Moderators) approve an edit made by a user posing as the author of the post? you can still find two or three regular reviewers who do not go by that consensus and wrongly approve such edits. Other problem is with reviewing where careless or superfluous edits gets approved, most likely to increase review count. How do you deal with such reviewers or with their reviewing? If you don't see a problem, please tell us why do you not find such reviews a problem at all. 
  


History suggests that when I see reviews like that, I deal with them by getting annoyed for a while. But when I've cooled down, I think the best we can do is make a new meta post to draw the attention of the reviewers to our policy (without naming and shaming), or talk in chat if they're active chat users.


  
  If you're a regular here, you would have soon realized that we have a huge quite an issue of crappy migration from one of the larger SE sites. That site deals with questions posted by enthusiasts and power users of computers.  What is your stance on crappy migration? Do you have a preemptive solution? If yes, what is it? What do you suggest to regular flag raisers and close voters to do with such crap?
  


This has two parts. First, to flaggers and voters: deal with migrated questions the way you would deal with any question. If it's off-topic, close it. If it's a valid question but shows no research effort or is not useful, downvote it. It looks bad to the questioner if their question gets migrated and then closed afterwards, but that's not on us, it's the fault of the people at the other site who migrated it.

Second, I think it's important to deal with this more generally by talking to moderators on other sites and encouraging them to get familiar with our on-topic criteria. SE sets a standard for moderators that you should only migrate to another site if you're an active user of that site (or if you've asked them first). I've gone out to SO before (as I'm a close-voter on that site too) and reminded them of their obligations, but this is going to be an ongoing process as people come and go on all those other sites. We just have to keep trying to get other sites' moderators to support the idea of not migrating crap.


  
  How do you define https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1997/96277Android independent questions? The only available answer to the linked question doesn't seem to solve the original problem stated in the question. https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2110/7088Some extra thinking material can be found in the original question.
  


Most of the candidates have discussed this issue in chat many times, as well as on meta, so I know that I take a relatively broad view of what's on-topic for us. To my mind, the main purpose of having on-topic criteria for questions is so that the questions on the front page look attractive to visitors, in the sense that the people we want on the site see the front page and think, "this site is for people like me". With that in mind, I'm inclined to be somewhat accepting of questions about battery charging, touch screens, SIM cards, USB-OTG when they are interesting to Android users. Often it's hard for a new user to know if their problem is specific to Android or a more general problem, and I don't think it's fair to apply on-topic criteria that questioners have no way to judge. I think it's reasonable to continue to reject questions about carriers, phone shops, or websites, because they're not relevant to our community.

I've noticed a recent trend to push the "Android-independent questions" close reason to cover questions that are about apps rather than about Android itself, or about apps that have an iPhone version as well as an Android version. I think if we followed this suggestion in the terms that are proposed, we'd be closing most questions on the site, as well as applying a close criterion that almost nobody can judge fairly. It seems to me that this drive is simply a pretext for closing certain low-quality (but valid) questions, but I think that abusing close-votes for low-quality questions would hurt the site in the longer term.

When I see each case and I consider whether to vote-to-close, I ask myself: if I saw this on the front page, would I think the site is for me? Can we help this person without hurting the site? That's something I apply not just for Android-independent questions, but also for other hard-to-judge borders like the line between automation (on-topic) and app development (off-topic). Often close-voters get into the mindset of rules-lawyering the on-topic reasons, considering whether the question matches a particular form of words, and trying to close questions to keep the site neat or improve our "unanswered questions" stats; but to me, those are all secondary to our main goals of helping out our fellow Android users and making the site welcoming to them.

I would be curious to know: what do you think of questions along the lines of "Where can I buy ?" or "When will  start selling ?" They are (intentionally) covered by the current close reason, but would you consider them to be opinion-based? Or would you consider them acceptable, and not requiring any action at all? (Or something else entirely)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis You're right, that close reason does cover a lot more than just app recommendations, and the kind of questions you mention do fall into that but aren't quite opinion-based. The main problem with questions like that isn't anything about the questions themselves, but that they attract spam answers. We could try to adapt the existing question to be specifically about "shopping advice" rather than using the phrase "find or recommend an app", but I'm definitely open to other suggestions. I think we need to establish first what we're actually trying to achieve with that reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I second eldarerathis, you've made some good points here that the site ought to discuss.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I "third" it (finally got what you meant in chat back then). Though I still tend to direct explicit app requests to SR (if matching that site's criteria), we shouldn't close a question *just because* of the word "app" in it (which is why I usually first check if it can be easily reworded to avoid close-voting for that reason – without violating the OPs intentions).



















Quoting from reasons for closure under off-topic (emphasis supplied)

If it's clear from context that the user suggesting the edit is the same person as the user who posted the post, then yes, please do approve the edit. Typical clues include:


The poster is an unregistered user (identified by a browser cookie rather than a long-term credential), who is rather new to Stack Exchange (typically, that's their first question).
The suggested edit is either anonymous or from an account created later than the post. If the latter, the account has the same display name and avatar, or has manually chosen display name and avatar as opposed to userNNN and the Gravatar hash patterns.
The edit adds information that was requested and is not controversial in any way.
The wording of the edit suggests that this is the same person (“here's my configuration as requested”, as opposed to “I have this problem too”).


While it's theoretically possible that someone would suggest such an edit with incorrect information because they have the same problem or just to troll, it's unlikely. “I have the same problem” cases are clear from wording. Troll cases can happen, but on factual matters, there's nothing to troll. If an edit suggests text that's an opinion piece, then you should reject it.

Accepting the edit obviously helps the original user. It also helps the site as a whole it means that the post will get into an acceptable state sooner, so there are fewer moderation actions to take, there are fewer bad posts around, and helping the user drives engagement up.

If the suggested edit is from a second account, please leave a comment pointing to https://android.stackexchange.com/help/merging-accountsthe help center, something like


  You seem to have accidentally created a second account. Please see [the help center](https://android.stackexchange.com/help/merging-accountshttps://android.stackexchange.com/help/merging-accounts) for how to merge them. Once you merge your accounts, you will be able to edit your posts directly.




This is the policy I follow (whether I'm a moderator or not, I don't see why it would make a difference), and until I saw https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2101/2016-moderator-election-qa-question-collection/2112#2112your question in the moderator election it wouldn't have occurred to me that a site would have a policy against it. Having now seen this meta thread, it still isn't clear to me:


why you https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1984/should-users-non-moderators-approve-an-edit-made-by-a-user-posing-as-the-autho#comment4505_1984don't approve the edit “even if [you're ] convinced somehow that both users are same”;

why you think that reviewers applying the perfectly reasonable policy of approving helpful, non-controversial edits is a problem that needs to be dealt with.


I'm not a regular here and I don't have enough reputation to review suggested edits, so don't worry, I won't approve edits by a second account of the same user on this site. Nonetheless I'd like to understand why you find my behavior (on other sites) objectionable.

Now, to the points in the second section: 1) I don't approve because it appears at the superficial level that the author and poster are same. Only the moderators have the tools to actually go in detail and see if the reality differs. Also, I review by book. If something differs from the book, being a mortal I reject it. That said, *I always reject with a link to *account merge* page.* 2) content in an edit that doesn't come from OP's comments on post or provides related resources/hyperlinks is I consider deviation from author's intent...cont'd..b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...3) I find it as a problem because until you posted an answer, Matthew's answer was the only answer reflecting a moderator's as well as community's stance on such edits, which acted as a policy in itself. I find deviation from the policy a problem to be dealt with. Now, the question I posted for candidates, I clearly asked there that they should tell us (if they feel) why they do not find such edits a problem at all? That should explain that I, at that time and still now open to suggestions here. If your answer is upvoted beyond Matthew's I'll abide by your view. Simple as that. :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord (1) While moderators have more tools, ultimately, it's impossible to be 100% sure whether two users are the same person, so the difference between moderators and non-moderators is a matter of degree. (1') The first rule of the book is: if moderation tasks can be done by a computer then let a computer do it. The reasons humans are involved are to apply common sense. (2) is contradictory: it only applies if the edit comes from a different person.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your (2) is dependent on your (1) so you're interpreting my 2) as contradictory, while I already take the stance that I would not be approving any edit which deviates from the broad guidelines stated. 2) I'll prefer to clear that the reason I prefer a book than apply that sense you're referring to is because your approach would cause approval of trolls at some point *and it would*. My approach *makes sure that it never happens*. I also let the editor know that they should go for an account merge so it's not that I don't want the question to be improved either.

That tag ideally serves as a preemptive measure to stop the off-topic question (about development/programming) from being posted. It is expected from a user that if not the wiki, the user would at least read the excerpt of the tag they intend to use in the question. 

As the fate would have it, the existence of questions with that tag signify that some users do not prefer reading anything or acting on the suggestion provided by a tag at all. 

Perhaps if there is a way for us to evaluate the practical usefulness of that tag, deletion or expansion of the tag may become a priority for Community.

I've just stumbled upon the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/read-onlyread-only, used by 11 questions. My first evil idea was adding a https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/want-writewant-write (which I of course didn't do). So I'm asking for a consent here: IMHO that tag should be burnitated.1 Opinions?



1: For those who've not yet heard the term "burnitate", two hints here:

Although, if someone has problems with `/system` (or `/sdcard` on KitKat), they might need that tag then.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Then this fact IMHO should be part of the question body, not a tag. The proper tag is "file-system".

Those are very useful combinations :P


















IMHO it's useless. As you (@Izzy) said, the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/file-systemfile-system is the appropriate one for this situation, preferably with a clarifying clause in the question body (or, even better, in the title).

That's not to mention this tag (https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/read-onlyread-only) is nowadays a total misnomer except when it comes to the ARM TrustZone TPM chip firmware, which is (hopefully) burnt-in. Nearly nothing nowadays is really read-only with the correct tools.

This tag should be done away with at the earliest.

P.S.: What does "burnitated" mean?

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower tag doesn't have user guidance.  Lacking user guidance, it can be (mis) used for anything related to power without checking for suitable tags available, as is the case

Going through 52 questions in the tag and appropriately adding tags, I found the questions , mostly related to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-onpower-on, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-optionspower-options, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chargingcharging, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/battery-lfebattery-lfe. As such there is no value in duplicating under https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower and the fact that no user guidance has been approved since inception adds to the argument that it is redundant

I discussed this with mods in chat and seek consensus for:


Burnitating https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower tag
Making "power" a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-onpower-on so that it is not recreated in future


Edit:  If you have reasons to retain the tag, please present them
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Burnitate "Power" tag?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks to all burners for their combined powers :)


















I'm one of the mods beeshyams discussed this in chat, and I've also checked some of the questions using this tag. My results where exactly the same, as was my conclusion:


replace the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower by one of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-onpower-on, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-optionspower-options, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chargingcharging, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/battery-lifebattery-life
if one of those "replacement tags" is already present, and none of the others fits, simply remove the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower
if there are no more questions using the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower tag, convert it to a synonym to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-onpower-on.


All in favor of this, raise your … ahm … mouse-pointers and upvote this answer – as I also agree with beeshyams we should have some consensus here :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for your support and should have credited and acknowledged your suggestion in question.I have already added relevant tags to  the questions (where required) , *without deleting [tag:power] tag*.Of course, this can be reviewed. That leaves us with next two steps once we get *ayes*b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I did not want to *assume* consensus and delete [tag:power] tag. I suppose mods have means of deleting the tag in one shot, whereas manual deletion would pop up 52 questions in *active questions*, merely due to tag deletionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's exactly why I didn't go straight for it. Thanks for your preparations! AFAIK at least a mod can go straight to convert a tag into a synonym, but that would leave the "original tag" on the question (just new uses would directly be replaced with the target). Not really applicable in our case here, as not all `power` tags mean `power-on` (or are even related to it); so we'll have to do it manually anyway.


















I agree that https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower is a bit uninformative. I'm not yet convinced that making it a synonym for https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-onpower-on is the right thing in the long term. While a lot of existing uses of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower are about startup, there are a lot more about the power button. If those questions start being tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-onpower-on, then that tag will become as useless as https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower is now. Maybe we need a new https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-buttonpower-button tag.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding [tag:power-button] tag proposed,  we have [tag:power-options] tag ( with usage guidance) and [tag:buttons] tag ( *without* usage guidance ). Maybe modifying the former or creating a guidance for the latter to meet  needs of proposed tag could be an option. I may be in a minority, but feel we should make existing tags more inclusive, rather than create, given the fact people (especially new users) don't seem to read tag description (my assumption) before appending them and go by tag name or what comes up, like typing battery brings up battery-life, so add that if it fitsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@beeshyams `power-options` isn't fitting here. But after a quick glance I agree on "buttons" (which is even used in a matching case), as it deals with all kind of hardware buttons (from volume rockers to headset buttons). It could use an excerpt and tag-wiki though (hint: easy place for +4 rep :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@izzy As suggested [tag:buttons] tag description has been created to accomodate proposed [tag:power-button] tag and stands approved. Tagging relevant questions with [tag:buttons] tag can be done when "go-ahead" is given (to avoid multiple bumps into active questions)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Which brings another set of tags into the game: we also have tags for [home-button](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/home-button) (x 31) and [media-button](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/media-button) (x 5). Should they be integrated with the `buttons` tag then as well, or left stand-alone?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@beeshyams we have the [tag-cleanup](http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tag-cleanup) tag here at meta, which can be used with questions like "calling for a general tag-cleanup" :) (I've linked it here, so you can take a look at "past tag-wars" and how they were organized)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@izzy thanks. I didn't know that and a quick look shows most of them originated by you :). So,it appears from a cursory look that tackling them on a case by case basis is the precedent. Going by that , let's get the present one closed and arrive at actionables in terms of a) main question b) merging the tags pointed out by you with "buttons" tag. +1 for "tag wars" :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@beeshyams may I suggest opening a new Met-Q using the `tag-cleanup` tag and summing things up there? Not a good idea to do all that in comments :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme If I read your answer correctly, you basically agree with all parts of my answer except for the synonym power->power-on, am I reading that correctly? `buttons` wouldn't be the right target either IMHO, and not synonymizing at all will simply result in the `power` tag reappearing sooner or later. So may I suggest going the full approach as outlined by beeshyams and me, and decide about re-routing the `power` synonym another time / with another Meta-Q? I (and if I'm not wrong many others) would oppose a new `power-button` tag; see above discussion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Maybe instead create a synonym `power-button`->`buttons` (as proposed for `home-button` and `media-button` above)?


















Since this is 3.5 years old I don't remember exactly what happened, but this was part of an effort to consolidate duplicates into a single canonical question.  The older question you point out specifically limits itself to Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich, and we wanted something more general.

You can see from the other duplicates listed that there were also questions specific to Eclair and Froyo, with the latter being even older.  I suppose I could have expanded my existing answer on that one, but we try to avoid altering the intent of questions as per https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/686/editthe editing guidance:


  clarify meaning without changing it


We've done this kind of duplicate-redirection in a number of cases, notably with these questions:


https://android.stackexchange.com/q/476/1465What can I do to increase battery life on my Android device?
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/1184/1465How do I root my Android device? (later reversing the policy since rooting often warranted a specific question with fully detailed answers)
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/2885/1465What is the difference between: Rooting, Jailbreak, ROM, Mod, etc.?
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/2696/1465When will my phone get the Android 2.2 update (FroYo)? (each later version also got its own question with similar treatment of dupes)




Now, one thing I did more recently was to remove the Community Wiki status from the answer.  I did that because I was the only one maintaining the answer, but that was a mistake — the intent is still for everyone to contribute if they can, whether or not they actually do.  So I've re-added CW status there.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Initially older question didn't mention any specific version. http://android.stackexchange.com/posts/14662/revisions . Version edit was made possibly by comments demanding author to do so.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I wouldn't call it a "demand" -- the full text of the comment was `What version of Android? (Also, stick to one question per post -- and your second question would actually be closed if asked).`  Regardless, that edit was made half an hour after posting and we consolidated everything more than a year later.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, let's call it "You demanded author to specify exact version in order to intentionally de-generalize the question and later delete that very yours comment". Would it be more correct?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PF4Public Yes, I made a 14-month plan to steal rep from a question with zero votes, and it all hinged on a simple comment.  I'm a mastermind.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yet you deleted your comment exactly after this question appeared. Why bother? Besides, if you admit that comment was a mistake, then you could easily edit that particular question and your argument of "clarify meaning without changing it" is effectively not applicable here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@PF4Public while in general it's never acceptable to hijack a question, I don't see this as such. In general, we try to make a question specific enough to be answered. Now that it has been answered *specifically* to that version, reversing the question to be more general was not encouraged since it'd invalidate the answer partially (reduce the completeness of the answer). And then, there's always policy change or quality improvement over time, that made the creation of the canonical post. Worst case, if this was really a hijack, I don't see any harm whatsoever (always assume good faith)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While this discussion is diverging a bit, I'd like to make my points clear on this. 1. As I had noted in a comment to this question (which was deleted for some reason) these questions are taken by examples be it a good or bad example. 2. Older question could be edited into general question since it was asked that way at the first place. 3. Matthew did a great job in  updating his own answer - no doubt. 4. This makes dangerous case: this may trigger massive questions duplications and hijacks intentional or not. 5. What are the bounds for generalization?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In addition to my 5th point. Imagine I'd ask "Ultimate Question" with "Ultimate Answer" to be 42 and try to make every question to be a duplicate of this one the-most-general-question-ever. Furthermore, it might be reasonable to ask everyone making generalized questions with their answers a wiki to discourage anyone seeing this as an example of acceptable practice of question hijacking.


















One of our VTC-reasons reads:


  Questions asking us to find or recommend an app, device, ROM, accessory or off-site resource are off-topic for Android Enthusiasts as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam and become obsolete quickly. http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shoppingInstead, describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve.


Due to a https://android.stackexchange.com/q/143470/16575question asking for manuals (which are not explicitly mentioned in this close-reason but most likely implicated by the term "off-site resource") I've checked for a corresponding post on Meta which I could refer the OP to to offer some background. Imagine my surprise when I didn't find any! I've checked our https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp center and https://android.stackexchange.com/faqFAQ immediately afterwards, but also nada.

As this is a "custom close reason" of our site, it didn't come "pre-installed" – so somehow it must have gotten there. Unless it came backpack on some malware and now always pops up in that list, we must have done something to bring it in there.

So my two-fold question is:


What resource did I miss here were a community consensus was reached on this?
If that cannot be found, should we now fill this gap to back the reason?


Don't get me wrong: I do not want to get rid of that close reason (it's there for a good reason: answers matching this formula tend to outdate quite soon, result in (rotting) link lists, and all the like).

Is this is a mistake or a deliberate move that the terms "regular people" are not mentioned in the https://android.stackexchange.com/tourtour (https://i.stack.imgur.com/Unyzz.pngrecord) of the site? As of now it currently notes:


  Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for enthusiasts and power users of the Android operating system.


On the other hand, in the page https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicwhat topics can I ask about here? (https://i.stack.imgur.com/8G3YP.pngrecord), one gets to see:


  Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange is for enthusiasts, power users, and regular people who use the Android operating system.


(Emphasis mine)

Moreover, the said help center page now makes me wonder why do we not simply write:


  Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange is for users of Android operating system. 


Per https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/201/96277this question, I conclude that the terms "regular people" have been there for quite a long time, but I'm not sure whether the question notes the mention of the same in help center or tour in particular.

"Regular people" are also welcome on this site per https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1687/96277this post, so I don't see why the terms are missing from the tour?

Surprisingly, http://apple.stackexchange.comAsk Different shares the same problem in https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topichelp center and in https://apple.stackexchange.com/tourtour.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why "regular people" are not welcome in the tour?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, probably an oversight that occurred when the tour page was originally rolled out. Changing it to simply "...users of the Android operating system" or even just "Android users" is probably a good idea.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Other possibility: because everything starts from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tour) a site for "*professional and enthusiast programmers*". IMO, the "enthusiast" part was meant to filter out the "newbie who doesn't know & care about manual/user guide and just ask question" (well. that's a problem on bigger sites like SO, but not so much on here)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. could be  [Super User](http://superuser.com/tour) as well.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Meta It is.

We have a lot of questions on the https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/broken-screenbroken-screen tag, and they're all pretty similar but different. There are basically n variables, and you get a slightly different set of possible answers for each combination:-


only the display is broken, or only the touchscreen is broken, or they're both broken
USB debugging is already on or not
an Android version where you have to click a notification to allow MTP, or an older version
the user wants a full backup or just some files (just contacts, just SMSes)
device supports https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/usb-on-the-gousb-on-the-go or not
full-device encryption or SD card encryption or neither


There's also a set of solutions, each of which is applicable to some subset of the situations. It makes it really hard for visitors to know where to look to find the answer to their question, and just as hard for us to triage new questions, determine if they're duplicates, and if so of which question.

How can we make this situation better? I'd like to get to a situation where it's easy to identify a list of possible solutions that are applicable to a given combination of factors, and to point visitors at that list.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can we manage and organise our "broken screen" questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related: http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/q/1860/12442 .

AFAIK, there isn't one.


















I haven't been a member of this community for very long, (or SE as a whole for that matter), however:

I feel that this site is going down the tubes. There are a ton of people asking low quality questions about rooting, why something doesn't work in a custom ROM...

I could be wrong, but I doubt those types of questions will EVER get an accepted answer.

Even this question, that I asked, and which I believe is completely on-topic, has been ignored: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/144024/wifi-direct-on-5ghz-bandWiFi direct on 5Ghz band?

Therefore, I'd like to propose one of two things:


Rooting, custom ROMs and the like become off-topic
There is a separate category exclusively for these types of questions.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Direction of the site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What do you mean, a separate category? Categories aren't a thing on this site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme - For example, the meta site is a category for questions about the site itself.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The meta site is special, and there's no way to have another thing like the meta site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While the sentiment might be true, it's impossible to have another category without creating a new site. However, I don't think that's a good idea either, because with current situation, there's no one who will answer those questions, and basically it's just a dump of ignored questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme  - Then I propose that rooting, custom ROMs and the like become off topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The core problem is actually that this site has few active users, while there are so many possible questions. Your on-topic question was not ignored, but almost all of us (regular users) don't have the knowledge/experience to answer it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I definitely agree with Andrew -- your question being unanswered is most certainly due to no one knowing the answer rather than being hidden by other, worse questions.


















You are right in a lot of ways:


Many of these questions are underspecified, and we need to prompt the user for details.
Many are not applicable to very many users, or if they are then they are hard to find via search.
Many are common issues that we should be collating into a single comprehensive question/answer.
Many are due to bugs that we can't help with or can't reproduce.


And so on.

However, the site is not "going down the tubes" because this is not new.  We have always dealt with high numbers of these questions, and right now our activity levels are pretty consistent with the past.

Making rooting questions off-topic is not really an option.  They can be perfectly good questions and answers (https://android.stackexchange.com/q/18171/1465example) and are obviously highly relevant to many Android users.  Many of our most active users are also experts on those types of questions — it is a core part of the site.

I also don't think that separating them out into another area/site will help.  One of the biggest issues we have here is people who completely ignore our existing types of off-topic questions, so such separation would (a) be ignored and (b) not reduce the number of low-quality questions in any way.

Instead, I think we should focus on how we can improve them.  We've slowly been forming many "canonical" questions for common issues; continuing this is important so that we can quickly mark relevant questions as duplicates and reduce the clutter.  There have also been some suggestions that we ask SE to alter the Ask Question interface to have some sort of warning about our scope and the required level of detail which would be helpful if we could convince them to add it.

Every single Android device I own is rooted. I am an avid user of TWRP and CyanogenMod. It's just that people can't seem to ask clear, answerable, and helpful questions about such things.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e510 months later, I still think that something drastic needs to be done to improve the quality of this site. Just out of curiosity, what is the question/answer ratio?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndroidDev It is almost exactly 1:1 over the last 6 months.  I am not sure how to see the breakdown of answered vs unanswered questions in a specific time period, however.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about the answer-to-accept ratio?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndroidDev I can't see that from the mod tools, but you might be able to figure it out with https://data.stackexchange.com/


















The form of words in the site-specific close reason is certainly broad enough:


  Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off topic


I think this is clear and reasonably unambiguous - or at least, any areas of ambiguity are in areas where the community has differing ideas of what questions we want answered. In any case, it seems eminently sensible to me that the wording we use to tell people their question was off-topic should be the same wording that we use to tell people up-front what questions are off-topic.

If anything, we could do with an extra explanatory sentence below the bullet points, to explain that SO takes app development questions, some kinds of ROM development questions, but no publishing questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have edited the question to make the point clear that this is about the help center rather than the site-specific close reason. If that be the case, then why not make the "Development" on-topic page of the help center mirror the wording of the close reason?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's what I'm suggesting, yes. I think the close reason wording is better and should be copied to help/on-topic. (The wording in help/on-topic is older.)


















eldarerathis https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2154/1465recently split off that section to give it more prominence, which is great.  I think you have a fair point about the wording, though.  I've added this line:


  Creating or modifying custom ROMs is also off-topic.


I think that should be sufficient, but let me know if not.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How about reducing to "*Questions in relation to anything which requires creating or tweaking the source code are off-topic here*"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll accept this, but @Firelord 's suggestion is also a good idea, as it is very succinct.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, is `mount -o remount,rw /system && vi /system/etc/…` or adding system applications something else than "modifying (custom) ROMs" then? ;)


















I'm bringing this up because of https://android.stackexchange.com/a/145161/1465this answer and because I don't recall how we've handled them in the past.

IMO, it is a valid answer and might also help some adventurous users.  I also don't see it encouraging any more developer questions, or overwhelming end-user answers.  What do you think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should we delete answers that are purely programming solutions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You might be interested in linking [this answer](http://android.stackexchange.com/a/111437/96277) as well.


















That particular answer has my vote (and the only vote as of now). The reason I voted (in past I successfully sought moderator attention for deletion of similar posts) is because it doesn't serve what we consider an end-user here by any metric. In any general post, I do not find it objectionable if its author explains how some code is the cause of the problem, but I believe an answer should not limit us to that. The author should strive to find other means to solve the problem instead of asking us to modify the code (because modification of source code is off-topic here so there is no reason we should be suggesting something as an answer which we do not welcome at first place as a question). If the author fails to find other means or comes to a conclusion that only the modification of source code would solve the problem then they should bother to stress that in their answer.

I do not see any need to treat that post as an exception. If the author believes that their time and efforts have not been compensated with review from competent peers and their upvotes then I recommend they frame up an appropriate question on SO or on a forum of programming questions and then post their answer. That would be best for everyone with no harm done to anyone. 

I'm sure that those adventurous users in our community must be active on SO or in other programming questions forum given the nature of their interest so their interests won't be hurt either if my recommendation is followed.

(This should not be construed with just anything but to posts pertaining to modification or creation of code.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You have your point here, @Firelord – and I'd upvote this if it includes a single exception: answers with code are OK if OP indicates they'd be acceptable (think of a "nasty issue" to be solved in "any way possible"). But I surely agree such answers are "unwanted" if that condition is *not* met – especially if from the question it seems clear OP is non-tech-savvy. That'd definitely deserves *downvotes* then. If a mod should delete it is something else, as is whether the answerer wants to go for [peer pressure](http://android.stackexchange.com/help/badges/20/peer-pressure) :)


















There is a precedent here, a programmatic https://android.stackexchange.com/a/129486/131553answer to one of my questions  that guided me to flag this answer as NAA ( flag history reveals this as disputed)

Simply put, the point here is usefulness of answer Vs Site Guidelines. Making exceptions based on utility of answer invites setting up a precedent. 

Hypothetically, if one knew a better way to code and post  alternative answer highlighting that, what should one do? Or, if the OP/ another visitor who also knows coding seeks a clarification? (Agreed, I am stretching possibilities)

IMO, it would be more prudent to adhere to site guidelines and I fully support https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2163/131553Firelord's view. He has pointed out successful moderator intervention in past, for deletion of such answers

There can and should be a discussion on border line cases but not in cases like this where it is clear cut (= it does not belong here)

Edit: Another possible instance where non adherence to site guidelines wouldn't help. There are accepted ( commercially implemented  ) solutions pertaining to charging, which are in the nature of shorting some pins or connecting a resistor across some pins to achieve results

These work, are useful but do they belong here ? (on this site, as an answer)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding your edit -- why would such posts not be acceptable here if they answer the question?  Hardware solutions that might apply to another device without Android are fine if they solve a problem with an Android device, much like ones on the software side that might be useful on devices running Linux and yet solve an Android problem (which I mention specifically because they are very well received here).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mathew Read: I think I didn't articulate clearly. Proven commercial hardwaresolutions are surely welcome. What I was implying (and should have clarified ) is that if one suggests an electrical tweak and encloses a schematic for it. In that sense it wouldn't be welcome ( and as *off topic as coding* IMO. Thanks for raising this concern as also the main questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Ah, that makes sense and I see your point.


















One factor nobody has mentioned yet: an answer that says, "you have to modify the ROM to do it" could well lead someone (the questioner, or someone else who sees the answer) who has never tried making ROMs to start doing it. Or it could lead to a ROM developer adding that feature to their ROM. Or, in this particular case, someone might see it and realise that a particular ROM already has that feature.

I think those all sound like good outcomes. ROM developers don't just spring into existence fully formed: they're just users with problems who try to learn something to solve them. I'm generally quite happy with an answer that leads people into a non-end-user solution, as long as we don't start scaring people off.

That's what I wanted to include in my answer but didn't know how to phrase it. +1 from me :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And don't forget that if you think an answer is "not useful", that's what the downvote button is for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Definitely. "Not useful" is something else than "NAA" (and not a reason mods delete a post ;)


















Why hasn't anyone suggested this till now?

Mod-Lock the post with the message that this post is important for historical reasons but it is not a good fit for the site (I guess that can be done for answers too?) - SO does this for questions which are popular/informative but technically off-topic.

So far this one has had little attention, and it's mostly negative.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Besides, @MatthewRead: can we "lock" answers? I might have missed that (due to the fact I never felt the need), but AFAIK only "the entire page" can be locked.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy, answers can most definitely be locked separately.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@TamoghnaChowdhury Check, you're correct.



















  Rooting, custom ROMs and the like become off-topic


Definitely not. They are a genuine part of Android to many of us. While I agree that many of those questions are of poor quality – that doesn't make the topic poor.

I agree https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2157/16575with Matthew here:


  
  Many of these questions are underspecified, and we need to prompt the user for details.
  


And this is how I deal with those usually:


Adding a comment pointing out what's wrong and how to fix it (edit-in missing details etc.)
Close the question (unclear/too broad, or whatever matches)


So if OP improves the question in a way it "becomes useful", I immediately re-open it. If not (and as long no one starts a discussion in the comments), Roomba will take care for it.


  
  Many are common issues that we should be collating into a single comprehensive question/answer.
  


This is what we address in several places already, e.g.:


one rooting question per device
closing ROM requests as dupes to our central "Where can I find a ROM"


Looks sufficient for me.


  
  Many are due to bugs that we can't help with or can't reproduce.
  


These we often close as off-topic already, and point the OP to the corresponding forums, bug-trackers, etc. We could "enforce" this a bit more, maybe, via a separate post on Meta with a strong consensus declaring them "off topic". Still, a "gray area" might be left with us (how to tell when it's a "clear bug report" or a misbehavior caused by other reasons?)

If you'd ask me for what I'd declare off-topic, I had a clear candidate though: 95% of the WhatsApp questions fall into that category ("Android independent"). But not being an expert in "asocial media", I keep my fingers off of those :)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can't have one rooting question per device. (Well, for a nexus maybe) But for all the others, a single software update could render the solution useless. And thanks to the carriers, the rooting process would probably be different for each carrier's firmware. Furthermore, how could we ever get our hands an every Android device, let alone running each carrier's firmware, AND be able to test every single version of Android it could run?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"You can't have one rooting question per device": Yes, we can :) // "..different..": A question can have multiple answers. Each answer could e.g. begin with "tested on FW/branding/carrier/Android version". // "how could we ever get our hands an every Android device …": We never aimed to. We take what our community members contribute. We're not a "contracted service company" that has to provide answers to all questions (or our answer would be "42" to all :)


















Factory reset protection is a hot new feature, and one that's catching a lot of people out, judging by how many questions we get about how to get around it.

These questions are all asking pretty much the same thing, but the answer depends strongly on what phone is involved (and will change for different firmware versions too). The situation is somewhat analogous to "how do I root my phone?" or "how do I install a custom ROM?" questions, and like those topics, I think there's a risk of these questions getting messy. Unlike "how do I root my device?" we should expect that the answer for the majority of phones will simply be "you just can't", so I'm not sure if the "one question per phone" approach will work here: we'd end up with a lot of unanswered questions. OTOH, it's likely that if someone discovers a way to bypass it for a phone where it was previously thought impossible, they might ask and self-answer a question about that phone, and I think we want to encourage that (rather than closing the question and making them merge the answer by hand).

Matthew Read's https://android.stackexchange.com/a/127745/12442answer is pretty close to being a canonical answer for this question, but the question it's on is for one phone only, and of course the answer only deals with a small selection of phones. I'm not sure that trying to edit this question to be more generic and then making the answer community wiki is the right thing to do here; nor does breaking up the existing good answer into answers on separate per-phone questions.

I'm a bit lost about what we should do, and I think that now is the time to act, before we have a spaghetti dish of overlapping questions to clean up. I'd like to hear the community's opinions on what's the best option, or to hear some new and better options.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What shall we do with "how to bypass FRP" questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could we have a single question with answers per phone? *Most* devices will be handled by a "you can't" answer, and any devices where it can be bypassed could be answered in a separate answer? I guess it depends on how many device specific answers we expect to see?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I actually don't think that genericizing the question is a bad thing, since the answer already tries to cover so many different devices. I also personally see no value in attempting to do "one phone per question" types of things at all, though. Answers have huge character limits, there's no reason why we need to break up all this information other than perhaps worrying that people will take offense to their questions being marked as dupes. Rooting is *maybe* an exception to this (but there are a ton of generic root methods, so...)


















Remember that suggested edits require the time of two reviewers to be effective. To avoid wasting people's time, it's important that such edits should be a substantial improvement to the post. The block you've found is an automated one, which is applied to people who have had a lot of edits rejected, to avoid wasting everyone's time: both your time spent suggesting edits that aren't wanted, and the time of reviewers.

Looking through a few of your recent suggested edits, I noticed that they mainly consist of three kinds of change:-


Adding paragraph breaks after every sentence. While a big wall of text is hard to read, most questions are not improved by adding paragraph breaks, especially if you put them between every sentence. I notice that you didn't write in that style in your own question, so why would you think that change would improve everyone else's questions?
Inappropriate use of code formatting, as in https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/141595this example. It's called code formatting for a reason. It's not for emphasis, it's not for blockquotes, and it's not for the names of phone models or the name "Android" itself. Using it for text that isn't code makes posts less readable, and it confuses screen-reader software used by visually impaired people to browse the site. It's OK to use it for command-line commands (adb sideload), and names of things in program code (SurfaceFlinger), and other things you'd normally see on your screen in a fixed-width font, but many posts on this site shouldn't use it at all.
Replacing a word with another word that means the same, or rephrasing that doesn't add clarity. https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/141593Here's one example: you've replaced "the bank tried to assist" with "The Respective bank tried to assist". The word "Respective" makes no sense at all in that context. https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/141590Another one: you've replaced "I use [phone]" with "I am using [phone]". It's a completely pointless change and makes no improvement at all. https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/141537One last example where you've rephrased the title of a question so that it's a statement instead of a question. The result of that is that the revised question no longer asks the question the OP wanted to ask. That makes it less clear, not more.


We do have a lot of posts on the site that are very hard to read and would benefit from substantial editing, to help the authors of those questions get better answers. In that situation, it's a shame when people start making trivial changes to posts that are already readable and understandable. It would be so much more helpful if you could focus on the posts that have real problems instead.

There are two reasons to edit a post on SE sites: when the post is in a really bad state and needs improvement to bring it up to a minimum standard; and when the post is almost perfect and can be made perfect with a little care. The edits that you've had rejected don't fall into either of those categories. They edit questions that are not perfect but acceptable and clear, and either make no change to the clarity or make the question a little less readable.

As for other sites, I can only say that reviewers are different on different sites. For example, Stack Overflow has a lot of users who are desperate to get to 2000 rep without much effort by simply spamming trivial suggested edits. Some reviewers find it saves time to just accept them rather than spend time thinking about whether the edit was worthwhile. For what it's worth, if I saw the examples I pointed out on any site where I review edits, I'd reject them there as well.

Now that you've triggered the automated block on edits, I hope that it will give you some time to take this advice on board and think about what kind of substantial improvements can be made to posts. After a short time, the block will be temporarily lifted. Suggesting good edits at that time will cause it to be permanently removed. I hope you'll take that opportunity, because we need all the help we can get to fix the posts that are genuinely low-quality.

I agree.

I have a general Gmail question (not Android-specific) and am trying to figure out the best Stack Exchange community (if any) to ask.  Can anyone suggest any?  There don't appear to be any, judging from the master list of communities.  But I just thought I'd ask.

If not, can anyone suggest any outside forums?  In my experience, the official Google Product Forums are quite undermanned.  Several of my questions have gone without a single reply.  I've also tried the Google sub-Reddit with similar results.  It is focused more on Google news rather than product support.  I'm not sure where else to turn :-/

According to the FAQ, these questions are disallowed:


  Questions that are primarily opinion-based, such as device or app recommendations or speculative questions


I understand that asking "which notes app should I use?" is a poor question because it is entirely subjective, because different people will have different criteria of why you should or should not use a certain app.

But consider a question like this:


  What apps are there to make toast with Android?
  
  I need to make toast using my smartphone, but I don't know where to look and Google isn't helpful.
  
  Criteria:
  
  
  Has to make toast
  Opensource
  No ads
  Relatively relevant (at the very least 10,000 downloads)
  


It isn't opinion-based, it is asking for all apps that there are, given that they fulfill the given criteria. Would it still be unfit for Android.SE?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can I ask all the apps available for an specific purpose provided I don't ask which one is the best?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See http://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic which has more detail -- short version is that *all* recommendation questions are off topic.


















No. That's still a "list question". There could be a dozen apps that do that. Which one is the "right" app?

If you have a specific use case and platform criteria, your question should be okay at http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.comSoftware Recommendations. I currently see well over 900 questions there tagged https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/androidandroid.

If I was to ask about finding the right charger for my device, would that be off-topic?

The help center https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicsays:


  The following topics are expressly off-topic here:
  ...
  Questions asking the community to find or recommend something for you (a device, app, ROM, website, etc), including what to buy and where to buy it


Specifically, I want to make sure I use the right charger so that 1) my device charges fast enough, and 2) I don't ruin it by using the wrong charger.

It seems to me like this could be construed as a shopping question. On the other hand, it also feels like a "problem (with [my] Android device) [that I am] trying to solve" and the community here would probably be able to help with it. I'm also thinking it would probably not be so narrow that it would never help anyone else in the future, like shopping questions often are.

Would this question be off-topic? Thanks!

Afraid this would be considered off-topic by most users, as you already guessed. I'd suggest checking with our https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chargingcharging https://android.stackexchange.com/tags/charging/infotag-wiki first (especially the "Chargers/Cables" section), and cross-check with questions using that tag.

If you weren't able to solve your issue that way, an acceptable approach would be asking for criteria (not chargers directly) – along the lines "What criteria I need to consider when buying a charger for my device". Though that might be seen "border-line" by some, it IMHO fits the site (and doesn't fall into the "shopping recommendation" category of "fast aging questions" – as the very same criteria should be still valid in a year or three).

Beside that: I've never spent much thought on that but rather charged my devices by the "nearest available charger". USB power has a specification (so no harm there) – and with wall chargers should be no harm either, as either they provide enough power for faster loading, or the device takes a bit longer: voltage again should meet the specifications, and if there are more Ampere available than requested by the device, the device would simply ignore that ;)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lots of Snapdragon-based handsets, including the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, S6, and S7, support Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 or 3.0.  If your device supports this technology, and if you want to use it for faster charging, you need to use a charger which supports the technology.  Such chargers can increase their output voltage when a phone or tablet requests it.  Yes, their output voltage.


















In https://android.stackexchange.com/q/149072/131868this question, there is https://android.stackexchange.com/a/149083/131868an answer which was posted (by me, but that doesn't matter) nearly a month ago.

Today, a user posted https://android.stackexchange.com/a/151384/131868new answer which (as far as I can see) is the exact same, just with different wording and formatting. I don't see this answer adding anything new.

What should I do when i see such a duplicate answer? (Not just in the case of this question, but in general.) Should I :


Comment?
Downvote?
Flag for moderator attention?
Do nothing?


What should people with moderator priviliges do in such cases?

Which option should be used? "In need of moderator attention"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5After you've kindly commented, and no action seems to be taken, you need to flag it as "in need of moderator intervention", since there is no "duplicate" option that desparately needs to be added for the whole Stack Exchange network because this network is not a forum, dupes are bad!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ΈρικΚωνσταντόπουλος Thanks for your response. I think it's worthy of being an answer rather than a comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, it fits as a comment here. The answer I was about to give is alerady in. I upvoted it instead of writing a new answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ΈρικΚωνσταντόπουλος While is certainly up to you whether you make it an answer, the current answer says to flag only exact (copy-pasted) duplicates. When an answer has the same content worded differently, it suggests to just comment. Anyway, not saying you should answer, the comment is fine too.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think I read it differently the first time.


















I can't answer for every moderator, and the closest thing I found to an official policy is https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/171494/duplicate-answer-as-late-answer-from-new-userthis question on meta.SE, but I can tell you my perspective.

In the case you describe, where a user has written a new answer that isn't the exact same text as an old one but has the same information, typically I'll leave a comment telling the new user that their answer doesn't add anything new, and hinting that it would be better to spend their time on unanswered questions. If there's any possibility the new answer might be useful as a complement to the old one (e.g. it explains things differently, some users might find the new answer clearer, it's updated for a newer version), then I'll leave the answer in place. If it adds nothing at all, I'll usually delete the new answer: not to punish the answerer, but just to keep the site tidy, and to reinforce the message that we're not interested in duplicate content.

As a non-moderator, you can add such a comment yourself, but please make sure to keep it encouraging. The new user is probably used to a forum site where you have to repeat replies to show that you agree with them, instead of being able to upvote. They spent their time writing the duplicate answer because they wanted to help, so complaining at them can feel very negative even if it doesn't seem that way to you. Make sure to say that there's no need to write a new answer, rather than that it's "wrong". Tell them that answering unanswered questions is more helpful. Welcome them to the site and thank them for contributing.

If that all sounds like a lot of work, there's no need for you to do anything. Having the duplicate answer doesn't really harm the site, it just makes it a little harder for the best answer to "rise to the top" with upvotes. If you want to add a custom flag to the answer to let the moderators know, feel free, but the outcome will probably depend on which moderator happens to look at the flag. :-)



There's another case, which is when a user posts the same exact text as another answer, either by the same or a different user, on the same or a different question. Please always flag these. We'll typically delete the duplicate and tell the poster why, but sometimes the situation is more complex and requires more effort. Sometimes it's a mistake, and the duplicate should have been an edit; sometimes it's plagiarism; sometimes it's an honest attempt to help, but it lets us know that there were duplicate questions that should have been closed. The system does quite a good job of detecting them, but some duplicates slip through. Typically I'll always mark those flags as helpful, even if I end up taking no action.

This rule was added due to a discussion on https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64824/clever-bounty-reputation-hackClever bounty reputation hack (on Meta SE) back in 2010.

So here's the hack:

Find an interesting question
Research and provide a very good answer
Open up a bounty on that question to attract attention and votes to your new answer
Profit!!!

2 and 3 may be out of order--I didn't see the timing of it. But either way, assuming he gets more reps than the reps spent for bounty, he still gets increased rep out of the deal.
[...] it does generate some useful discussion and insightful answers. Plus you can increase your own rep very rapidly by making your answers highly visible, and therefore frequently voted upon.

In which, it was responded by an ex-SE developer,

Note: we added a few more checks and balances

If you are placing a bounty on a question you answered, your minimum spend is 100
If you are placing a repeat bounty on a question, your minimum spend doubles till it reaches 500

(Emphasis added)

From this discussion, I assume it's to prevent "infinite" rep gain from increased publicity due to a bounty (especially, the doubling, but it's unrelated to this case).

First thing to ensure is that you don't edit the question to alter its meaning.  Invalidating answers like that is discouraged.  (If you hadn't had any answers, it would be fine.)

It's up to you whether to accept the answer, but generally you should only do so if you're in a position to verify that it works.  If your problem is different, that might not be possible.

If you think the "real" problem and solution would be useful to others, then consider posting them as a separate Q&A (answering your own questions is encouraged).  You might want to do a brief search first to see if there is an existing question that matches which you could answer instead.

We've got an https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-beta-programandroid-beta-program tag (currently used by 6 questions) on our main side. How do we want to deal with that?

We've already discussed "nightly builds" in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2077/16575Recommendation for questions pertaining to a problem specific to a nightly build of a ROM, and I find this quite similar: Those questions including their answers have no value in the long run if they are about issues a user has with Beta software. And they would be off-topic anyway if the question deals with the beta program itself.

So how do we want to deal with a) that tag and b) questions using it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions tagged 'android-beta-program'b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"And they would be off-topic anyway if the question deals with the beta program itself." Why is that? Most of the questions with that tag seem OK to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme because most of them don't fall into the category of "dealing with the beta program itself". Currently, there is no such question using that tag. An example of such would be "How can I enroll in the ABP?"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FYI, I removed the tag from 2 unrelated questions. I don't have opinion on this tag, since there's also [tag:development-preview] that I created long before.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Thanks! That even raises the question if the two should be merged. I wouldn't raise that on SO (where it might be counted as different topics) – but for a user-oriented site, this might be seen different.

There's no point flagging such comments. Flags are seen by moderators, not the comment author, and moderators don't have any special power to make comments into answers. I think it would be really useful to have a special kind of "this comment should be an answer" flag, which goes straight to the comment author, but we don't have such a thing.

The only sensible course of action is to reply to the comment to suggest that the comment is a helpful answer and if posted as an answer, it would be easier for people to find and that you would vote up that answer. I've emphasized three parts of that, for the following reason.

Remember that everyone here is acting voluntarily. We can't force anyone to write an answer, and there's no obligation for people to write full posts. People contribute because they want to help others, and for recognition from other people via the site's reputation system. It's important not to act like someone has short-changed you by making their suggestion in a comment instead of an answer, or like you're entitled to a full post.

For that reason, I think it's important to be honest that you're asking a favour of the author. The three important parts of the favour-asking are (a) showing that you appreciate what they've already done; (b) showing how writing an answer is even more helpful than what they've already done; and (c) showing how writing an answer will earn them recognition from the community.

I know it's hard to be as encouraging as a kindergarten teacher all of the time. Certainly on occasion when I've been having a bad day and I know that whatever comment I write will be mean and sarcastic instead of encouraging, I've simply ignored the answer-as-comment instead of trying to get the author to fix it. I'd encourage anyone on the site to do the same if they feel that writing a suggestion with my three points is too much work, or is draining, and if they feel tempted to write a rude message asking someone . There are many reasons why answers-in-comments are bad for the site, but none of those is worth alienating users for.

So although I said the only sensible course of action is to reply to the comment, your "do nothing" option can also be sensible sometimes. As a community we pride ourselves on picking up litter, but sometimes it's OK to just leave one for someone else to find.

The automated deleter is already very lenient, and only deletes questions which contain content that our contributors have shown aren't useful or relevant to the site. Both of the questions you link have a score of -1. Of the roughly 1000 people who saw each question, nobody thought they were "useful and clear", but at least one person thought they were "unclear or not useful". They were deleted after three to four months of inactivity.

To prevent your questions being deleted, you need to make them more useful, so that other people will vote them up and not down. In this particular case, asking a first question, and then when you found more information, you edited your first question to include "UPDATE" and a link to a new question, but no explanation of how the questions related or why you'd done this. If I had seen the two questions, I might have closed the second question as a duplicate of the first anyway. I think that might have caused the downvote in this case, but the misuse of code formatting in your questions might have contributed too. In general, the advice in //android.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-askHow do I ask a good question? will help to make sure your questions don't get closed or downvoted, and consequently don't get automatically deleted as "not useful".

Beeshyams (one of our regular users, who often tries to help track down more complex problems) posted an answer on your second question, but you didn't upvote his answer or give him any feedback, so he deleted the answer himself three weeks later. If you found his answer useful, you could have voted it up, and that would have prevented your question being deleted. The system avoids deleting any content that anyone finds useful.



In summary: the deletion bot is called "Community" because it reflects the will of the site's community. If you write a question that the community finds useful, it won't be deleted. If someone puts the effort into trying to solve your problem, and that's useful, you need to show it by upvoting. Voting isn't just cosmetic, and it doesn't just give feedback to other people: it also controls the system, by showing it which content we want and which content we don't want.

This is my first question on the Meta site.

I would like to know if it's legitimate to ask a question which may be tied to development, but not have it as its main purpose to exist.

To be specific, I would like to ask from which file(s) the pm command of the Android shell extracts the required info when, for example, I issue the pm list packages command.

Is this a question that will be legitimate on the main site, or I'd rather refrain from asking it?

N.B. I'm posting this answer to explain what happened with Izzy's first example, in case any non-moderators are confused. It's not meant as an authoritative statement of policy, and I'd love to hear (agreeing or differing) reasoning from the rest of the community.



In the case of the first example you posted, I started editing the question in the way you suggest: removing the rotten link, and adding a note to say why. I was thinking exactly the same way you suggest: that's fairer to the answerer. On Stack Exchange, we tend to dislike deleting people's stuff unless it breaks the site or is actively harmful to the community.

But while I was making the edit, I changed my mind. As I wrote the note saying that the recommendation was no longer useful because the product doesn't exist any more, I felt silly. Why would we continue to carry a recommendation that isn't useful to anyone? All the people the answer might have helped have been helped and have moved on; it's not useful to anyone any more. And because it's no longer useful, there's the risk that future visitors might downvote the answer. Is that what the answerer would want? I don't think it is. I think that they'd come back and delete the answer themselves if it started getting downvotes because it was no longer valid.

In this case, the answer was old enough for the rep gain to survive the deletion of the answer, so the asker lost nothing. I'd hope that that's always the case if the answer has been invalidated by outside change. So in this one case, I decided to delete the answer instead.

I'd rather much see that kind of flexibility - choosing the response that's best for everyone in the particular situation - than a blanket policy. Sure, it opens the possibility of different moderators on different days doing different things - i.e. inconsistency - but I think it's worth it.

Do you happen to know the exact time frame for the "gained rep to stick"? I knew it once but forgot. Something along the lines of 90 or 180 days?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think your 180 day guess was right; I had it in my head as six months.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree.  Answerers keep their rep for old answers even if deleted, so we're not losing anything if the answer is now completely unusable as in the case of a closed-source service that has shuttered.  I'd say just be careful in the case of old apps that have been taken down, etc. -- there's always an .apk floating out there somewhere.


















Sometimes, there are issues that affects one or many nightlies, and that are carried over since a stable release, or even before it.

For example, I'm currently running a CM13 nightly build, and have a Wi-Fi issue that's present since the first CM13 nightly, and which affected even the one stable build that was rolled out some months ago.

Given that the issue never changed, and so it doesn't depend on a specific nightly, which policy should be applied? Should such a question be flagged? Closed? Would it be legitimate to ask it?

When my mouse hovers over a vote (up/down) button or “favorite” in Chrome 53, there is a very annoying visual effect where the button “pops out” (becomes slightly bigger, then back to the original size) for a fraction of a second. https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1905/major-design-updates-are-now-live/1934#comment4347_1934I'm told that this is by design.

Ok, but it's extremely annoying. How can I turn it off?

I've successfully turned off the animation when clicking an up/downvote button with user CSS (I wish I didn't have to copy this to every browser, though):

a.vote-up-off {
    transition: none !important;
}
a.vote-up-on {
    transition: none !important;
}
a.vote-down-off {
    transition: none !important;
}
a.vote-down-on {
    transition: none !important;
}


But I can't figure out how to turn off the animation that happens on mouse hover. How do I get rid of this animation?

There's no way to remove it after the fact, so you'd need a user script that runs at page load (`document-start`) and intercepts the `addEventListener()` calls.


















Yes, absolutely — even if there are other alternatives, as long as it is relevant.  Just clearly disclose that it is your app, and then otherwise treat it the same as you would treat an answer about someone else's app: link to it and explain how and why it solves the user's problem.

You might interpret an answer "I've used this app for years and it's great" differently from "I work for this company's marketing department and you should buy the app". "Astro-turfing" (posting adverts as if they were genuine recommendations) devalues all recommendations.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Dan Hulme I was mostly thinking about free apps, but I understand what you mean.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5All of that said, if the user has a recommendation for his app in most or all of his answers, that's undesirable.


















Stack Exchange recently started a collaboration project with the University of Melbourne, in an attempt to improve the automatic detection of duplicate questions.

More information on the project and a call for help from the community can be found here: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/286329/project-reduplication-of-deduplication-has-begunProject Reduplication of Deduplication Has Begun!

In it, Tim Post mentions that Doris Hoogeveen (me) will post a message on the different meta sites to let you know that we're ready for help. This is it!

As a brief summary, the project is about finding ways to automatically determine if two questions are duplicates, and also to detect the opposite: falsely tagged duplicates. To validate our methods, we need manual judgements from people who really know the data. This is where we need your help. It is impossible to manually annotate all the data from Stack Exchange, and so we have applied several filters to make sure we only show you questions pairs with a high likelihood of being duplicates.

Participation is completely optional, and there's no minimum time requirement. If you are interested in participating in the project, please head over to the annotation interface, which can be found here: http://hum.csse.unimelb.edu.au/se-annotate/http://hum.csse.unimelb.edu.au/se-annotate/

You can log in with your Stack Exchange account, so no sign up is required. The site also contains some more information on the project, which might answer some questions you may have. And I'm also happy to answer them here.

Thank you!

I was one of the close voters.


You were specifically seeking for an app, which is discouraged for reasons mentioned and reproduced



  Questions asking us to find or recommend an app, device, ROM, accessory or off-site resource are off-topic for Android Enthusiasts as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam and become obsolete quickly



Asking for a way or means to achieve your aim, is broader and covers  all approaches  to solve ( apps inclusive but  barring programming / ROM modding, etc) . 
If the intent of OP is to specifically seek an app based solution, then https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/SE Softwarerecs is the right place. Here it is about posing a problem and asking for solutions, and those who respond may well offer app based solution or something in addition to app . See https://android.stackexchange.com/q/160254/131553this question for example. It was also voted for closure but edited by me to make it a non app seeking question and answered  . OP now has a method to help him  involving a hybrid approach of using an app and other means resulting in a win - win outcome for the OP and the site
There are older questions on the site, which seek apps specifically and have not been closed. My guess is that these pre-date the current policy


Related https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/353/131553Are questions looking for apps on topic? As in: "I need an app that does XYZ?" or "I want a widget that does ABC"

Edit: To sum up , questions on this site are liable to be closed if they specifically seek app based solutions, whereas solutions can include app based approach
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, we definitely got a lot of "offline maps" questions early on in the site.  If any that are still around are off-topic, please flag them and we can close or lock them.


















On Android Enthusiasts it states:


  The following topics are expressly off-topic here:

Marketing your Android app or doing market research



If in the process of writing an App, assuming no need for help with writing/developing the code, would asking other enthusiasts on Android Enthusiasts for feedback regarding the App, and thus trying the App (providing a link to it), be considered as marketing? 

Would the likely end market impact upon whether or not this would constitute marketing? In other words, if the intention were to provide the app freely. If so at what level does Marketing come into play? If the app includes advertising or in-app purchases.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What constitutes marketing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Soliciting feedback or asking for help with testing your app is not a specific question, so though it isn't really "marketing" it's still outside the purpose of this site. There was at one time an attempt to create a program to pair willing beta testers with developers, but it didn't seem to get enough traction to really take off, as I recall.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If you're looking for feedback/testers, your best bet would probably be a forum like reddit or maybe our chatroom here.


















I'm just getting starting on Android development.  I'm using IntelliJ.

It's worth considering the type of answer that one will expect to receive.

On a development forum like SO, one will likely receive a very technical response.
On a softer (is that the right word to use) forum one will likely receive a less hard-core techie response.

Thus, there is merit in having this cross over and even an argument for identical questions on both forums as they'll be asking them in different contexts.

Are the hardware-based questions are on-topic for this site? As I personally think that this site is for Android OS complexities and not for the hardware on which the OS runs.

If the question is somewhat related to programming, such as building, developing, and debugging Android Apps, you should use Stack Overflow.

However, when the question is related to the Android Device, such as Hardware-related or software-related issues, using adb, and others, then you should post / ask the question on Android Enthusiasts.

This one comes to mind after seeing https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/167285/full-disk-encryption-on-google-pixel-xl-vs-google-nexus-6pthis question.

Historically almost every bump of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_historyAndroid API version warrants a new tag, but when Android 4.0.3 dawned as a "minor" version of Android 4.0 but comes with API15 instead of API14, there's no designated tag for it. I assume this is because that the lifespan of API14 is too short (2 months) to be of use to discussion, thus https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4.0-ice-cream-sandwich4.0-ice-cream-sandwich remains.

Now, minus the preview period, Android 7.0 (API24) has a lifespan even shorter than that of API14, then gave way to Android 7.1 (API25). In this sense Android 7.1 is definitely the way to go in future discussions. Should we create this tag and make https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/7.0-nougat7.0-nougat a synonym to it, or the other way round?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the tag "7.1-nougat" necessary?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The incremental versions of 4.0 were extremely minor IIRC, and the vast majority of questions about one apply to the other.  I don't know exactly what changed between 7.0 and 7.1, but the versioning would indicate something more significant.  We should separate tags (or not) based on whether there was a significant change to the end user problem space, rather than APIs or lifespan.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead From the API wiki page I linked above, the only _major_ changes seem to be Seamless Updates and Daydream VR. I don't know if that warrants a separate creation. 5.1 doesn't have much improvements either but it does have a separate tag.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Seeing that the Daydream VR is new to 7.1, I guess it warrants the tag *when it's needed*. That specific question doesn't need it though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't agree. Just make `7.1-nougat` a symlink(?) to `7.0-nougat` since they are all 'Android Nougat Family' like Lollipop and Ice Cream Sandwich do.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug I mentioned "tag synonym" which I guess is what you mean. There isn't a conclusion made yet. Do not that, despite both Lollipop, 5.1 and 5.0 has separate tags because of the features 5.1 introduced. If Daydream and seamless got enough traction, it's still reasonable to create a separate one.


















It is a bit late into this new year, being that we're already in the second month, but we are now cycling the Community Promotion Ads for 2017!

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting or fun Android apps
the site's twitter account
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2241here.

Were it open source, most of these problems could've already been addressed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DeathMaskSalesman Yeah, true.

I'm having a strange issue with ADB, but I want to make sure this is on topic first since it's somewhat of an edge case.

When I plug my phone into my Mac, I get kernel panics on the Mac constantly and I cannot figure out why, and neither can the Apple store. It's caused by adb, which is still on topic, but of course the issue probably lies within my mac.

Would this be considered on topic? (The support tag is incorrect, I'm aware. None of the required tags work for this)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is a question about Mac kernel panics from ADB on topic here?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5An evaluation you may want to consider beyond site scope is the concentration of knowledge that would be relevant to your question. Ask Different may simply have people who are better able to help you (but, admittedly, it's tough to say either way).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@eldarerathis that was my concern. It's an issue between 2 platforms and doesn't really fit anywhere. But as you said, Ask Different may know how to read the panic better.


















Have you tried another phone (if possible try a different model rather than just another of the same make/model)?

If it doesn't cause the kernel panics i'd say the issue is likely to be with your phone so your question would be on-topic for this site.

If both devices cause the same issue then the problem is more likely to be with your Mac so my gut feeling is that it would be off-topic but it's certainly not clear-cut. We do have lots of questions about how to get adb working on PCs (using a variety of OS's) so that could suggest that it would be on-topic.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, I never though about that, but that's something I'll certainly test this weekendb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree.  The OS is doing something wrong if it allows a peripheral device to trigger a kernel panic.  That said, trying to get it to work with an Android device despite this issue is probably on-topic.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The question here is not how to fix the problem, but whether fixing the problem is on-topic for the main site.


















It seems that way to me as well, and I don't understand why it happened in this case.

I have undeleted the answer.  In the future, you can simply flag your question an explain there (though coming to Meta was totally fine here, and thank you for doing so).

Answers are ultimately community property here and should not be deleted if they are useful answers to the question.  SE can disassociate answers from user profiles in exceptional cases if need be, but it's up to the author to contact them about it.

I created https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/macrodroidmacrodroid tag today. There are close to https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=Macrodroid100 questions / answers mentioning this app. Cursory analysis :

a) Handful of questions specifically mention this app ( tagged a couple of them )

b) Bulk of these , propose this app based solution. OP (s) did not ask for an automation solution (may not have thought of https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/automationautomation as an option ) but this app based solution was offered ( about 30 % by me ). 

Question

Should re-tagging ( in a phased manner) be done for a) only or both a) and b) ?

I searched site meta but couldn't find guidance around tagging questions which do not specifically mention an app but the solutions propose it

Edit  Following guidance here would imply option a) only -  https://android.stackexchange.com/help/taggingWhat are tags, and how should I use them?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tagging questions with a tag mentioned in solutionsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd say just A. If we started retagging questions because of the answers, we may not have a fun time :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanBrown-  I felt the same later and  I don't know what I was thinking.  In any case, can you convert that into a proper answer to close this please ?


















Tags are for the question, not considering answers (and they are usually "attached" before any answer is available) – so they should be based on nothing but the question itself. Imagine yourself the question does not have any answer, and check only based on the question.

We're not hitchhiking the Galaxy here that we have an answer (42) and search the fitting question to tag :)

I had a rather unpleasant experience with rooting my phone using KingoRoot as described https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1184/how-do-i-root-my-android-devicehere. I ended up installing some https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/171453/did-kingoroot-install-bloatware-on-my-phone-or-is-this-a-legitimate-android-locbloatware which now I can't remove. I would like to know what I should have expected:


Anything at all, as I do everywhere else on the Internet.
Bloatware is considered OK on Android.SE, as long as it doesn't steal my data or doesn't ask for ransom.
I was unlucky, everyone else have rooted their phones with KingoRoot and didn't get any bloatware.
I was the first one who tried and noticed the bloatware.
Something else.


I was going to edit the answer to either remove KingoRoot from it, or add a warning message next to it, but I figured that in cases other than #4 my edit would do harm instead of good, so I decided to ask first.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is the list of rooting methods supposed to contain bloatware?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd think something around #4 as well (definitely not #1 or #2) – but I don't have any experiences with Kingo I could go by and argue. Only thing I've noticed is that if people come here having issues with their rooted device, Kingo is mentioned more often than I'd expect considering there are so many other rooting tools around. So thanks for bringing this up! I definitely look forward to answers on this one.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm with @Izzy, #4 seems like the most likely cause for your situation. I don't think it calls for outright removal of Kingo from the list, but if Kingo is confirmed to install bloatware - even if the user can opt-out - it would be best for us to make that very clear on the community wiki which you've referenced.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dotVezz Thanks, both of you. I will be rooting another device soon which I wouldn't mind reflashing in the worst case. I'll take care to check what exactly gets installed, and if I get the same bloatware as before without a possibility to opt-out, I'll add a warning to community wiki.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@dotVezz I agree with you, and suggest turning your comment into an answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To be frank, I'd rather King, Kingo, iRoot and similar one-clickers are simply banned from the site, they don't really support many new devices despite what they advertised, and are always a source of infinite (often low-quality, duplicate) questions: unable to root, unable to replace with SuperSU, bloatwares, backdoors, etc. Sadly a lot of (slightly older) devices still have to rely on them...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Related to the threats of using such methods - see [this](http://android.stackexchange.com/q/131690/131553)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with @AndyYan about the banning of one-click-root apps that are known to be controversial in regards to malwares and such. In my opinion, even if they *may* allow to root older devices, this is no excuse for us to suggest potentially harmful software to users who are newbies on the topic.


















Yes, it is. 

Especially with the examples quoted, all the more so. Older question is not clear and OP didn't revise to make it clear. Only answer to that is based on a supposition of OP's intent. Newer question is clear in intent and has a detailed answer (with a bounty awarded )

Marking the older question duplicate of the newer one would benefit those who land up at older question.

Timeline doesn't matter - what matters is that a clear question with upvoted / accepted answer remains with other question being marked duplicate. If both of them have good answers and questions are similar in content, it should be flagged for merging
( This is my understanding from moderators in chats)

We want the best question/answer to become the primary.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And while mergers are rare, they happen from time to time.

Unfortunately, for some phones, bloatware will inevitably be installed on the phone if third-party tools are used.

Usually, rooting would involve this:

Flash a custom recovery -> use said recovery to flash a zip -> profit


Of course, a custom recovery won't introduce bloatware in 99.999% of cases. The zip file, provided you use https://plus.google.com/+Chainfire/posts/27xToSqi5emone that is from a very reliable author, is also bloat-free.

Now, some phones go through this process:

Install a tool, usually in an APK form -> Press a button -> profit


This is where things can go many ways. Your phone's fate depends solely on the authors of the tool.

Some tools, such as https://towelroot.com/towelroot, probably do not care about profits and as such simply does their job (rooting the phone) and nothing else. Unfortunately, other tools (like KingRoot/KingoRoot) do care about profits.

To answer your question, unless you know how to deal with low-level stuff instead of using third-party tools, bloatware is inevitable.



Since you already acquired root, you can probably:


Install SuperSU/Superuser from the Play Store
Install a root-enabled app manager
Disable internet connection
Remove KingRoot/KingoRoot/whatever-Rooting-App-You-Used and everything they installed.
Restart phone, and deny all unfamiliar su requests.


Since some bloatware have monitoring services that monitor their bloat and reinstall if necessary (ala persistent Android malware)
Also remove said unfamiliar apps using #2. Rinse and repeat.
This does not guarantee a clean system. There may be other unwanted stuff lingering about.
Some SU apps (e.g. Superuser) have this option to allow all su requests during boot. Disable this while you're sanitizing your phone. Do not enable unless you know you need to.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I couldn't help noticing that my phone's fate depends on authors of the tool in both cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DmitryGrigoryev But the difference here is, again, the authors of the tools. The authors on the first scenario are trusted by the community and have a record of *not* including bloatware.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I would say each tool should be judged on its own merits and not by the rooting method used. But if you're confident about that, then someone should go though the community wiki and either remove all APK-based methods from it or write a big fat **contains bloatware** warning next to them.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DmitryGrigoryev Exactly.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Towelroot is safe... if you trust me and my reverse engineering art, which you can find [here](http://android.stackexchange.com/a/165582/152843).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DmitryGrigoryev Law #1: If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it's not solely your computer anymore.

I've recently purchased a http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/gear-s3/Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch, and already I have some questions I'd like to ask of experienced users.

However:


I am aware that the watch's OS is Tizen-based, not Android.
My current questions have nothing to do with the watch connecting to an Android device. (In fact, my current phone, until the Galaxy S8 comes out, is still Windows-based and the watch is presently in Standalone mode.)


Considering that the watch seems primarily to target Android users (though it does support iOS), I expect there is a certain audience among this site who would be interested in and knowledgeable of the device. However, since it is not actually an Android-based device itself, I am not sure that questions which are solely about the Gear S3 would really be on-topic here.

Could someone please point me in the right direction for where questions about this watch would be on-topic within Stack Exchange, if such a site exists?

Sample question (currently the only one I have in mind):


  "Can I change the time display format for the built-in digital watch faces on my Gear S3?"

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this a good Stack Exchange site (or is there one) for questions about the Samsung Gear S3?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For anyone who runs into the display format issue I mentioned: It seems the fix requires Bluetooth pairing to a supported phone. (At the time of my original post, I was using a Windows Phone which is unsupported.) Once the watch is paired to a phone, it seems to automatically follow the phone's display settings - thus, if the phone is set to use a 24-hour time format, the Gear will do so as well for digital faces.


















We only support questions about non-Android devices inasmuch as they relate to using them with Android.  So your point #2 disqualifies you from asking here.

I do not believe there is a current SE site where you could ask your question; we no longer have a generalized Gadgets site for devices/OSes that don't have the critical mass for their own site.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Regarding a "Gadgets" site: I did find [iot.se] but I don't think that's quite the right fit either.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"we no longer have a generalized Gadgets site" - so we did in the past? Curious about its fate.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndyYan According to its [Area 51 page](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/614/electronic-gadgets) the beta didn't gather enough activity, so it was closed. Appropriately-tagged questions were migrated to [android.se] and [apple.se]. It was also mentioned in a [blog post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/14/pruning-season/).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See also: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/61593/21960


















As much as I prefer such questions to ones about WhatsApp usage (duh), off-topic is off-topic.

For device-specific questions I'd look at XDA-Developers before here. They do have a https://forum.xda-developers.com/gear-s3Gear S3 subforum, where you could ask such questions without restrictions, although the chance of getting an answer is debatable.

When I vote that a question should be closed, there are (as of April 2017) 5 options. The 2nd reads "Question is Android-independent) while the 4th reads "Blatantly Off-topic".
I can still recall a previous experience where someone asked a question about two iPhones. Soon the question got closed with the reason "Android-independent".
In the AI text it says "... for example 'Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?' ...", and from which I think what should be considered as AI should look like "I encountered this question while using Android, but it's not actually an Android problem". I can give examples that IMO belongs to AI, such as  


Good SD Card for Android phone  
Is a screen protector really neccesary (There actually is http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/167595an instance and I'm curious why it hasn't been marked as off-topic yet)  
Screen broken, how can I replace a new one  


And as well, BOTs should look like  


Transfer iTunes purchase
Transfer photos between phones (The one mentioned above)


But why is that question solely about iPhones marked as "Android-independent" instead of "Blatantly Off-topic"?  

Addition:

This screenshot is taken from an Android mobile (on A.SE Main Site). There's also https://imagebin.ca/v/3KIEIcLtCxMUanother screenshot that /u/152843Death Mask Salesman took from the official Stack Exchange app visiting the Main site.
If a moderator allows, I can flag one of my own questions with this option so that further investigation is possible. Please leave a comment if you want me to do so.  

Secondary question: What exactly is "Blatantly Off-topic"? Why can't moderators see this option?
Edit: /u/44325Andrew T. gave https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/283348an answer from Main Meta site for this.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is there any difference between "Android-independent" and BOT (in the recommend closure reason selection list)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5i don't see a close reason that reads "blatantly off-topic". That may be unique to the flagging experience, and it would mean that we can't actually apply that as a close reason when the flag is processed (either by a mod or users with close privileges). Maybe you could give us a screenshot of what you're seeing?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see a close (or flag) reason for "blatantly off-topic" either. I've checked on mobile too. Could this be an A/B test that we're not aware of? @iBug can you link to the question you saw this on?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bmdixon Maybe it's related to reputation? I can't give a specific link because *all* questions have this option for closure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't see this in the flags either, but that could have two reasons: As soon as one reached the rep to VTC, the corresponding flagging menu automatically redirects to the close menu (most likely reason – maybe someone with low enough rep can check that out). Other possibility: You're using some strange SE script and have injected the additional option. I cannot even remember having seen "blatantly off-topic" in my "early days", but of course that might have been just added lately.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I wouldn't have asked this question if I had used any script. I'm (surely) visiting the original A.SE site. Using Google Chrome 57.0.2987.132 from Google Play. I'm using a stock ROM (rooted and installed Xposed but I don't think it matters). Please help look further into this *strange* issue.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can see the "**Blatantly off-topic**" as well. I'm operating from the official StackExchange app. By the way, this option is available even for questions on this very Meta site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Here are two screenshots: one for the [flagging options for Android SE](https://imagebin.ca/v/3KIEIcLtCxMU) and one for the [flagging options for this very question](https://imagebin.ca/v/3KIDo1JbaW34).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug Wasn't meant as accusation! It's just one tends to forget such things (speaking of myself, of course). As pointed out, the other variant is the more likely, as confirmed by our Salesman. So flags don't completely correspond to close reasons, obviously.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, this looks like it may be what I was suspecting: the flag list has a generic "blatantly off-topic" reason added to it that is not available in the close reasons. I wouldn't be surprised if the latter goes directly into the moderator flag queue instead of going into the close vote queue for community review. If that is in fact the case, then there's not much we can do to deduplicate these without SE staff changing the flag dialog. We certainly don't want to lose the "Android independent" close reason and we can't actually use the BOT reason when voting for closure.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This is only occurs to users without close-vote privilege as @Izzy said. Please also refer to main meta: [What happens to questions closed as blatantly off-topic?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/283348/what-happens-to-questions-closed-as-blatantly-off-topic)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've always played it as how relatable it is. If it's talking about how to set up windows on a Chromebook, I'd call it independent. If it was asking 'does Mike Wazoski Blink or wink?' then it's BOT.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanBrown In what universe is "Windows on Chromebook" related to Android?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IBug yeahhhhhh, that was not a great example. It's still tech related (thus my original, but I did write that fairly late in the evening)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanBrown Assume I'm asking a question about my car which is running Androud Auto, will you mark it as AI or BOT?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@IBug Android Auto? So it is Android, and fine. Alright, here's a better example. If you wanted to know which app was better, I would say AI as it's not directly to do with android, it's talking about apps on it. (I'd also point the asker towards Software Recs, where the question should be accepted)


















You're right that Bryan isn't very visible on the site lately, but he's still actively moderating. Don't forget that many moderation actions are invisible to normal users (with less than 10k reputation): deleting posts or comments, removing posts from review queues, messaging or suspending users. Even the more visible actions (closing questions, editing, commenting on posts that need improvement) are not that noticeable unless you happen to see an affected post.

The rest of us are probably more noticeable because of the non-moderator things we do on the site: asking and answering questions. I don't think it's new that Bryan is the least active of us in that sense, but that doesn't mean he's stopped visiting the site or stopped moderating.

I'm still actively moderating in the background. And I am also on StackOverflow daily (being a programmer and all as well). Most of my moderation actions are not visible to normal users of this site.


















Android as an operating system dates back to 2008, and the first viable Android version (arguably), Gingerbread, was out circa 2011, 6 years earlier. Android.SE itself also has a ~7-year history.

During the course, many questions on meaningful topics have been asked, some could even be considered some sort of "FAQ", as the issue persists across many Android versions, and people outside SE are constantly flowing in (via search) looking for a solution. However, as Android version progresses rapidly and brings a lot of changes with each version, the solution proposed back then might not be as elegant or effective by "modern" standards. This part of the dilemma had been discussed https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1806/how-can-we-attract-new-solutions-to-old-questions-that-have-already-been-answerehere.

While I was reviewing close votes recently, I start to notice some duplicate votes, referencing such old questions as its duplicate "target", but the way I see it, the answers there are too outdated or general to be of reference value. Occasionally, there are also factors in the dupe "suspect" that's a result of the advancing of Android or the software in question, and not part of the dupe "target". Marking as dupe in this way won't help the author of the dupe "suspect" get much clue, and his question will probably get closed before it attracts careful inspection from knowledgeable people.

I personally feel that, after a certain time threshold, we should either direct our effort to updating such old questions before we assign them as dupe "targets", or when we can't, we should not even check the mark in the first place, but instead leave them as a platform for up-to-date answers to grow on.

What's the meta's opinion on this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Handling possible duplicate of very old questions?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Totally agreed with you.  There are a lot of the "same" questions that will have completely different answers for Android 2.2 vs 7.0 and shouldn't even be considered duplicates one way or the other.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Make that 3 of us. We need to get a list from data SE for the older questions, and see what could be filled up to work with today's android as well as older versions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My opinion. Whether a new question is a duplicate depends on the applicability of the solution mentioned in the old post. If an old solution still works, then I'd mark new posts as dups, and vice versa. BTW we can edit old posts and add a line in the very beginning saying "This method applies to Android m.n to x.y".


















The "general1 off-topic" explanation text already says  


  Questions on Android Enthusiasts should be asked from a end-user point of view and within the scope defined in the https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic.help center.  


And under the "What about other Android-related questions?" section, we have this for the 7th item 


  
  Android-independent questions, such as "Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?"  
  


I think it's more straightforward to close as the reason of "general off-topic", and optionally leave a comment to tell OP to read https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic.help center. Furthermore both reasons are rarely used so I think it'd be cleaner to merge them.  



1. All SE sites have a similar close reason to this.  
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do we really need the "Android-Independent" close reason?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I can follow that line, this way you could argue we only need "off topic" without sub-sections – as development, off-site resources and belongs elsewhere are also clearly outsite the scope of our site. We still have them so the user gets a better understanding *from the start.* Especially as most of them start arguing before "checking the scope" ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The problem is, that's only a reason to flag, not to close. Users who vote to close doesn't have this reason as a choice. Either they choose from the available reasons, or they write a custom reason.


















You claim that "devices from the same generation from the same manufacturer have very similar or even totally identical configuration". I checked the first specific example you gave, the LG G2 and G2 Mini, and they're not even based on the same SoC: the Mini has a Snapdragon 400 while the full-size one has a Snapdragon 800.

The real problem with the device-specific tags is that usually, people asking about a problem don't know whether the problem is device-specific or not. I think asking them to judge whether their phone is the same as one with a different name might be asking just a bit too much of them.

As for overly-specific tags like https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/google-play-wishlistgoogle-play-wishlist, they do no harm, and they enable someone to subscribe or ignore the tag if they're interested (or uninterested) in that specific thing. Tags that are actually unused (they are on one or zero questions) are removed automatically by the system.

P.S. That https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hardware-agnostichardware-agnostic tag is a bit silly. Tags should describe what the question is about, not the question itself. If you can't imagine someone subscribing to that tag, it probably shouldn't exist.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I've removed that tag.


















When going through the "suggested edit" queue, one in particular (now deleted) got me thinking. It was an answer post that was made in a language other than English, but it wasn't an answer to the question: it was a classic "I have the same problem" post.

Per https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/13676/do-posts-have-to-be-in-english-on-stack-exchangeStackExchange policy, English is required in all posts. However, it's also quite obvious (especially to frequent reviewers) that there are non-English posts flowing in every once in a while. Most if not all of them are meaningless, in the way of "I have the problem too" or "thank you".

I agree that, if the non-English post is meaningful, we should devote effort to at least a rough translation; however, the example I gave above is the first time I've seen someone trying to translate a post of such low-quality type. Given the fact that such posts will be deleted shortly, are such suggested edits acceptable/encouraged, and are we as reviewers still supposed to approve the edits?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are translations to low quality posts acceptable as suggested edits?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I find this question interesting, and I'd like to hear what the community thinks about this.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme: although it may not seem relevant to you, but could you please post the screenshot of that  "suggested edit"? It seems that the post has been deleted or something else happened, and we mortals cannot view that edit anymore.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I feel a little like it would be abusing mod powers to screenshot a deleted post, but I'll edit the text of the question to make it clear.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme Thanks, my bad, didn't think about the fact that we can't view suggested edits on deleted posts when I posted the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see. No issues, as the edit does the job. Thank you. :)


















I say, you move beyond the edit and evaluate the worth of the post. If the original post (subjected to translation, when required) holds value to the question (more than just a comment, but may not be a full-fledged answer) and the edit doesn't change the intent of the post, than accept or improve the edit.

If the post isn't worth to be an answer at first place or cannot be salvaged or should be a comment, than there is no point in accepting that edit. It would only bring that unworthy post on the front page under Active tab for no good reason. Furthermore, it would award the editor with +2 score. The reputation doesn't matter much here but the encouragement of having such an edit accepted may harm the site in future.

Harmful! How come? 

Reviewers are supposed to keep a tab on the quality of the posts on the Stack Exchange sites. Whatever they do, it becomes the norm soon. 


If they begin to accept LQP as worthy to be retained, quality of the site decreases since more LQP is equivalent to more unsatisfied and frustrated users and viewers.
If they accept low quality edits, they begin to raise an editor with poor editing skill and judgement, and that user, after 2k score, would raise  alike editors through their poor reviewing and unrestricted editing. 
If they upvote an LQP, others might take that such posts are actually of worth on this site. And users taking LQP as acceptable is never good for any site.


What to do than, other than to reject the edit?


Just copy-paste the translation, to the extant it is permitted, as a comment on that post so that other users do not indulge in the same editing process. 
Use your judgement towards that LQP accordingly so that other new editors and viewers don't get to see it anymore.
Ping that editor in a chat and let them know, kindly of course, why such edits should be avoided. It could be a canned response. Alternatively, you could avoid this by having the reason cited when you reject that edit.


Alright, enough opinion for now.

Whilst in the process of reviewing suggested edits, I mistakenly approved an edit that did not aim to improve the post.

Before I could do anything to fix, the link is gone and I fear this mistake could have bad consequence of rewarding users for harming otherwise good posts.

How can I revert this, in case I manage to track down the question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to reverse a suggested edit after mistakenly approving itb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think you can revoke an approval but suggested edits require two users to approve the edit in order for it to actually be applied. As long as two other users reject it then the editor won't be rewarded. I don't think you'll be banned for a single mistaken approval, i think it would only be repeated bad reviews that would result in that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for this, indeed this is intelligent policy from SE!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A ban is a somewhat extreme step reserved for those who continue to make mistakes and do not learn from them. As said below, don't worry, just continue the good work and revert the changes when you need to. :)


















You can't undo a review approval, but there's something you can do instead. Every post has a revision history, which you can get at by clicking the "edited time ago" link below the post. On this page, you can rollback to an older version of the post by clicking the "rollback" link on that version. This has the effect of undoing the edit (and any subsequent edits), but the person who suggested the edit still gets the +2 rep. You should explain why in the comment for your edit, because too much rollback-ing automatically raises a flag to alert moderators.

As bmdixon points out, just because you approved the edit doesn't mean the mistake is binding. Two reviewers need to approve a suggested edit. If the edit was that bad, presumably nobody else will approve it, so your mistake just means the suggested edit stays in the queue longer before being rejected. Even if somebody else makes the same mistake, the author of the post can now override the review result if they disagree. So it may be that the suggested edit never gets applied in the first place, and there's nothing to correct.



Automated review bans aren't a thing on this site. Stack Overflow has them, because there are a lot of users who "robo review" - clicking the buttons without thinking - just to get the badges. I'm proud to say we have a much better community here, so there's no need for such a system. Review bans are still possible for us, because the software supports them, but I don't think we've ever used them: there's simply no need. Even if we did use them, one mistaken review that you immediately try to fix wouldn't be a reason to ban you.

I raised https://android.stackexchange.com/users/flag-summary/2057642 spam flags for https://android.stackexchange.com/users/224411a guy's posts. My reasons for considering those as spams are below


He claims he's the developer of the software he's recommending (https://android.stackexchange.com/a/176905/205764See his post).
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smajenterprise.incognitoawayThe app costs US$0.99 on Google Play, and is newly submitted (June 17, 2017).
This guy has no questions, and only 2 answers, both of which are recommending the app, and their contents are almost identical. In other words, if he had posted other questions or answers, I wouldn't have considered him as a spammer.
His display name, Smaj Enterprise, is exactly the same as the publisher name on Google Play.
The whole answers are describing promoting the app (telling its advantages), which fits in https://android.stackexchange.com/help/promotionthe criteria.

As an experienced Stack Exchange user (I registered at Stack Overflow over a year ago), I clearly know what a spam flag mean. (https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/350567My profile on Meta SE) I carefully investigated the post before raising the flags.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why is this spam flag declined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5To me the post looks OK: full disclosure, nothing hidden. It's permitted to answer with ones own "product" as long as all criteria are met, isn't it? Agreed, only two (almost identical) posts, so it might be borderline. But is it really to be considered spam?


















That's some really thorough investigation, and it's good to see that you've put this much thought into the flags, even if they were declined in this case.

I didn't see the flags when you raised them, but I agree with the reasoning that Izzy presented. The answers this user posted are genuinely helpful and relevant to the questions. The answers are nearly identical, as you point out - but the questions are near-duplicates as well. (I think the main difference is whether root-needing solutions are allowed.)

Promoting your own app, when it's relevant, is fine on this site as long as you are honest in disclosing this fact.

The one thing I'd add to Izzy's analysis is that you're right that we discourage developers from advertising their own apps if it's the only thing they post, as it is in this case. Where the answers are otherwise good, I think on judgement I'd be inclined to mod-message the particular user and encourage them to post on a wider range of topics. In such a case, "validating" the spam flags wouldn't just delete the helpful answers, it would also mean the user has to fight the anti-spam system before posting other (non-promotional) answers.

In this case I hope you can agree that simply deleting all the posts would be a loss to the site. Even if individual flags are "declined", they can still be very helpful in letting us know when this kind of situation arises, and we can respond to that situation outside of the flagging system, in ways that aren't always visible.

Moderators always try to act within the rules as they're written. But that doesn't mean they're set in stone! If you think things should be different, and moderators should be acting differently (e.g. being more strict on self-promotional content, or more welcoming of it), then do raise that as a discussion in its own right.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So if I see a ppssible "not-so-straightforward" spam again, you mean I should raise a custom flag instead of  a regular spam flag so as to prevent triggering the auto spam-filter mechanism on new users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug One spam flag from you won't hurt anyone: that only happens if the post gets deleted. I don't think there's anything wrong with what you've been doing; it's just that the feedback makes it look wrong to you.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"we discourage developers from advertising their own apps if it's the only thing they post, as it is in this case" – that's what I was referring to by "borderline". Thanks for making it clearer!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug That said, a custom flag saying "All this user's posts promote the same app" would be clearer. We'll check it out either way, but being more explicit makes it more likely you'll get specific feedback.

Not a real answer to this, but I've experienced this font issue in at least 3 of my Windows 10 laptops/PCs.

Things common to all those PCs, if I remember correctly, were: 


Windows 10, drivers, Chrome, and all software up to date.
Copy of Roboto font family (downloaded directly from Google) installed locally.
Font issue was noticeable not just on Android SE, but even on Google's sites using Roboto.


Issue was gone once I uninstalled the font family from my system. I suppose it was a Chrome-specific issue where the local Roboto family competed with the Google fonts' online version of it.

This could be relevant to Ubuntu as well.

I use Arch Linux, and have instaled ttf-google-fonts-git. Roboto has always been a part of the package. But the site still looks awful on my computer. When I was typing this as a comment, I couldn't see what I'm typing well enough. Though I can see this just fine when typing in the Answer section. 

If you must use Roboto, please use Roboto-Medium or Roboto-Regular instead of thin or light variants. The site is currently unusable for me. And please set up fallbacks for people who don't have Roboto.

I installed `ttf-google-fonts-git` and now I can reproduce the issue. Unless you *know* you need all the fonts in that (bloated) package, I suggest removing it and installing the notofonts bundle (which includes a load of fonts which work for most, if not all, languages) instead.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@terdon Installing or removing font packages to cater to specific websites seems like approaching the problem backwards. Websites should cater to a general userbase, and not require *removal* of packages that people find useful elsewhere. Where will this approach end? Install package `foo` to make website A legible, install conflicting package `bar` to make website B legible?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Oh absolutely! I am not suggesting that's a solution to what is undeniably a bug. I was just surprised since I couldn't reproduce it and noticed that you were using Arch, so I installed the package. Since installing it makes the bug appear and removing it fixes it, I figured I may as well let you know since that might be a decent workaround for you. And having seen your profile, I will bring back the original *scripts* I wanted to use instead of *languages* in my previous comment. The notofonts bundle works for all scripts I've tried and I've tried a good many.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@terdon Ah, I misunderstood. Apologies.


















I just opened the Android Stack Exchange site to link someone to it and when I saw it I thought the page hadn't loaded properly. This is what I saw (you'll want to view full size, they're uploaded full-size):

https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Btr7.png

https://i.stack.imgur.com/ywd0l.png

Perhaps on some monitors it looks ok, but on both my laptop screen and my external monitor it's very hard to read. I have to physically move my head well below my monitor to read the text, especially on the smaller lines, such as the Hot Network Questions sidebar. Comments are almost unreadable.

I'm on Windows 10 Creator's Update (w/ latest updates) and Chrome 59.0.3071.115 if that makes a difference.

It'd be awesome if the font could be changed to something legible. I'm going to tag this with bug because I think this couldn't possibly be intentional.

What I'm seeing is clearly _very_ different to the linked question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I disagree, it's extremely similar.  Barring further evidence I think the small differences are due to you using Windows rather than Ubuntu, and I'd suspect the same root cause.


















This appears in the main meta in relation to historical locked posts https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/267781/308746What to do when I want to improve a locked post? where the accepted answer says (in part)


  So that is it. A locked post is locked, and will probably always remain what way (note that actively maintained posts shouldn't be locked, so this one wasn't maintained at least for some time). These posts will not be maintained any more, no matter how good your edit might have been


(Emphasis Supplied)

So it looks like there is nothing that can be done, unless there is a policy decision to reverse this

Coming to the discoverable but not editable (and votable) portion, it is by design - from https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/126587/308746What is a historical lock, and what is it used for?


  Historically-locked questions are omitted from normal question lists (those on the home page, /questions, and the various per-tag lists), but can still be found by searching for words in the post or title (via either site-search or Google, etc). The visual appearance of the entire post is altered by removal of the voting arrows from the question and all answers.


Being discoverable has the unfortunate consequence of being misinterpreted / misquoted , and I am not sure how that can be addressed, if it needs to be ( given that incorrect information is plentiful on the Internet )

It's still locked though, and therefore can't be downvoted to counter this, nor can a new answer be created that doesn't include this flaw.

https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/298854/351462Over on Meta Stack Exchange, I am attempting to compile a complete list of Stack Exchange sites which support YouTube embedding.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/180747/how-to-do-jupyterThis question has a bunch of development-related keywords like "build" "development" and "package".

However it is not really a question about "developing for Android", it's about "developing on Android". Using Android as a development platfrom is, in the concept of Android, using, not developing.

It's asking about missing shared library symbols, and after searching on Google, I found the answer is "Build ZeroMQ from scratch by yourself". This answer is, however, off-topic on Android. But it does not affect the question.

In short, the question is similar to


  I wrote a program on Android using Termux, and the dynamic linker said it's missing a symbol "pw->pw_gecos".


So what? I can well remember Dan Hulme ♦ said (from my memory, exact wording may vary)


  If your question is about using Android as a development platform, it's OK. But if you ask something like "I wrote this code on my Android phone, what's wrong with it", it's clearly off-topic


I can't find the quotation above but I'm fairly sure it's said by Dan Hulme somewhere on this site (A.M.SE).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this question really off-topic?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A dynamic linker could miss a symbol even on a desktop environment, plus the topic is about *fixing an issue arisen during development*. In my opinion, that's a flaggable question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure that particular question is worth this discussion, because it's missing a lot of detail and basically unintelligible.


















In the last couple of questions I filed in here at AE I was advised to solve my issues by acquiring a Microsoft Windows licence. 

I have been struggling to get TWRP to boot on one of my devices and on a first a reaction a user https://android.stackexchange.com/a/180617/50942directed me to do it with Windows. While I regard this mostly as a raw attempt to help, even after I succeeded in flashing TWRP to the device from my system the same user https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/180613/install-twrp-on-samsung-note-10-1#comment232402_180613kept promoting Microsoft Windows.

In https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/180927/install-lineageos-on-samsung-note-10-1-without-twrpa follow up question I specifically stated I am not willing to acquire a Microsoft Windows licence. This lead not only to more promotion of Microsoft's system, but even to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/180927/install-lineageos-on-samsung-note-10-1-without-twrp#comment232923_180927a clear hint to use it illegally.

I do not regard the behaviour of these two users particularly malicious (one at least is clearly trying to help), they are possibly just being somewhat careless. In other StackExchange sites this kind of behaviour would be less welcomed. So the question boils down to how tolerable this sort of product promotion should be at AE.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Promotion of products and suggestions for illegal product usageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Perhaps you could specify in your questions what type of PC resources you have access to. Something like "I'm looking for solutions that will work with an Ubuntu PC" would probably suffice, and would (hopefully) avoid discussions/posturing about "Well why can't you use X instead?" since everyone's expectations would be set equally.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see three downvotes on your question on main site. Could they be the result of meta effect?


















I didn't happen to see these questions and answers when they were posted. Coming to them afresh now, I'm going to ask you to consider if maybe you've read too much into this. As Andy Yan said, he uses Ubuntu as his main desktop. He's used both Odin and Heimdall, and based on this experience, he thinks the easiest way for you to achieve your goal is to use Samsung's official tool, even if this means using Windows as a one-off, or borrowing the use of a Windows PC from a friend or workplace.

Just consider how much easier he must think it must be, if it would be worth even that extra effort. Little wonder then, that when you persisted with trying to do it the hard way, got no help, and got stuck again, that he checked whether you really need to do it that way. That's not "promotion of Microsoft's system": it's just someone trying to find the expedient way, and taking care that you're not making things unnecessarily difficult for yourself because he hasn't made the trade-offs clear. I think that's the opposite of "careless".

Far from "tolerating" this kind of behaviour: we encourage it. Lots of users come here with problems and artificial constraints, and most of the time it's easier to remove the constraint than to work around it. You're welcome to hold out for an answer that involves fixing your Heimdall problem, or for one where you don't need to install a recovery at all, but you can't expect anyone to feel bad for telling you an easier answer, even if you have special reasons why you can't or won't follow it.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi Dan, I appreciate your answer. Just consider this issue from my perspective. To follow the suggestion that includes using Odin I would have start by acquiring a Microsoft Windows licence (99 €) and then install it. For that I would have to partition the hard drive, set up dual boot, install Windows and reinstall my system. That all could easily take me a couple of days. In contrast, installing `heimdall` and going through its manual took some dozens of minutes - it clearly was the most expedient procedure in my situation.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Another point here regards `heimdall`. I have not yet reached a definitive conclusion, but at this stage it does not look like it failed to flash TWRP. The conjecture that it is the cause of the boot failure might be precipitated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It doesn't matter how much quicker it is to set up Heimdall if it doesn't work for you. And I don't think it's unreasonable for Andy to guess that you might be able to use someone else's computer, even if you know you can't.


















Following https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/181028/this question, someone wants to "trial for ever" by tricking an app with false date/time. Of course that's unethical (but not illegal, we have closed a few "obviously illegal" questions).

By "ethical", we mean A reasonable person would find it inappropriate for concepts of right and wrong conduct. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EthicsWikipedia's article about "Ethics".

Several people are having a disagreement whether unethical questions should be closed. Let's discuss it.

Related on Meta Stack Overflow: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/267699/5958455How do we handle questions that are potentially or blatantly illegal or malicious?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should unethical questions be closed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm interested to hear the community's opinion on this. As a (former) indie app developer myself, I don't want to see us enabling app piracy, but as a moderator I'm here to follow the policies we set as a community. (That's why I've not intervened in the close-vote you link to, if that wasn't clear.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First, please don't allege a motive when none has been given. Our site is not about "what is ethical" (taking the case given: would it be unethical if the app you have the trial of is no longer available at all?), and that might sometimes be hard to decide. Ethical "border-cases" aside: what we *can* decide about is whether we allow questions about specific technical procedures, such as circumventing app restrictions. Note we obviously permit that already for circumventing regional restrictions like downloading apps in countries they are blocked for ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about [this case](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/134911/change-imei-number-to-obtain-tablet-data-plan), however, where it is clear the poster wanted to **_steal_** the difference in cost of the plans? Both answers even make this an explicit point early. I still resent my original flag's being rejected _merely because it raised ethical concerns_.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While it may not be illegal, such behaviour is unlawful.  It would violate the Terms & Conditions and so renders the tinkerer liable to civil action.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Chenmunka, could be the case but it depends on the terms.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From illegal and unethical question and response, we learn about the situation and best way to prevent or patch it. The  unethical or illegal thing is to use it. that is the difference between Hackers https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#Hacker and Crackers/HiJackers/Anonymous/...


















Leave open.

As long as it does not violate any existing law (tricking with date/time , AFAIK, does not violate any) in applicable countries, we should be welcome to discuss. As per https://android.stackexchange.com/a/181029/205764my answer, such tools does exist.

That trick does not involve any cracking or reverse engineering. It makes no difference (to that specific app) from changing the global time of my device. Then why global but not to only one app? What if the OP did not mention "trial period" at all? What if the OP wants to test an alarm app or Trigger's timed event?

It's wrong to judge that "because your intention is unethical, your goal/objective is also wrong" (and closing the question). As said above, the answer may be useful to someone looking for a way to test an alarm app.

I agree that such questions should be closed:


  How can I bypass the trial period?
  
  How can I get the full version for free?


... but not these:


  I know setting a fake time can bypass the trial. How can I set it?
  
  Placing this key file grants me the full version. How can I move this file to the desired place? I already have it in my SD card.




Let me repeat: It's not hacking. It's unlike Freedom or Lucky Patcher. I agree that F/LP should be OT here for illegitimacy (referencing https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=freedom+%5Bandroid%5D+%5Bin-app-*%5DStack Overflow's opinion).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"As long as it does not violate any existing law": In which country? We've often said we're not lawyers (and indeed, for that we have Law.SE). Apart from that: What if OP hadn't mentioned the trial at all, and just asked about "fake a date for one app only"? That could be useful for a lot of "ethical and lawful purposes", like testing whether some alarm really fires on XMas eve, without waiting until it's too late :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Let the "law" be abstract.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Trouble is, you won't get an "abstract rule" that's clear. For the next upcoming case, how will you argue that it matches? One could say "in {that dictator-ship} this is outlawed" – and whoops! your chain of argumentation is broken right at the start, as you wrote "any existing law", which includes even those of "rogue states" and one-man-shows.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy So we can simply edit out everything that is *potentially* unethical, to avoid unnecessary discussion and divergence.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Indeed. Or even go one step further and replace/insert some matching "ethical reason" (like my alarm-tester example) – and everyone would agree on lawfulness and ethics of the question :) Side-note: That's what I sometimes do with "is there an app for X" questions, by rephrasing them to "is there a way to achieve X" ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5None of us is morally infallible enough to dictate what should be talked about and what to scoop under the rug: I favor an approach in which, if one is able to answer a question but prefers not to due to their moral standpoint, they're free to avoid answering, whilst allowing such a question's existence. If not, what should be said about the Reverse Engineering SE? The site still answers questions about reversing software such as Nintendo's (proprietary, hence usually **illegal** to reverse). Just a pirate's pov. #Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Even in case of actually "HACKING", there can often be a legitimate reason of crowd sourcing penetration testing methods to make an app more secure, not necessarily the default assumption that it is being done to rip it off or do something "unethical" with it - which is a relative standard at best. How do you think most rooting capabilities are achieved? SO anyone with a rooted device is unethical? That make sense to anyone? But it involved exploitation and modification of things to make it possible. Often in making snap judgements, people lack context and shows their own bias.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@GµårÐïåñ Anytime and anywhere the "ethical confront" is brought up, it resolves in a huge waste of time for any party involved, as ethics are a relative standard, like you said, and a general consensus is not often met. For an example, look at my last sentence just above: I said that I'm a pirate, of the kind that spends quite a bit of their time by reversing software. I do think that piracy is a form of art, just as protection is, and I'd find it offensive to go around and distribute patchers for any slacker to take and use with no hassle. Hence, I think ethic to never release my works.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DeathMaskSalesman agree, that's why I felt that it is a bit of an exercise in futility to try and "standardize" ethics; perspective and context matters. I was actually posting a question when I saw that on the margin and came to read it and as human nature goes, felt compelled to comment. I wasn't lobbying for one way or another, just that we should take as a neutral approach to it as possible. If blatant, it will be obvious, like the courts found in regards to porn, "I can't define pornography but I know it when I see it" - and in those cases, should be mitigated as social responsibility.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DeathMaskSalesman "proprietary, hence usually illegal to reverse"... not at all in the EU.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndreaLazzarotto I too am in the EU, but many are not.


















What's the intent of OP?


  ...Changing the date and time in the phone can "evade" the version and trial and continue to use it


Further, they want to know


  .... if it was possible to change the date of a single app even by changing the source code of 'App


To my mind, there is no ambiguity around that


Is it legal ? - we are not equipped to discuss
Is it ethical ? To me clearly, NO
Could OP have other valid reasons for asking , which might have triggered this question ? - possible,  but if not stated, let's not assume either ways but go by what's presented ( also note that there was no response to my first comment, stating that it is unethical )


Should we permit such questions (not withstanding the fact that a diligent search on Internet would reveal ways and means ) ??

Emphatic NO

It is immaterial and irrelevant. I am only going by what's articulated by OP in the question and objectively limiting myself to that. Read bullet point three again


















Unethical for whom?

(Scroll to the end to find my stance.)

That would be my first question. For a die-hard follower of https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.htmllibre software ideology, personal use of a proprietary software could be unethical for them. But they may also extend their definition of ethics on others, arguing that if a user willingly chooses to use a proprietary software than they lack ethics.1

We collectively prohibit questions on blatant piracy not only because piracy of a software stands illegal in many jurisdictions but because there is enough agreement elsewhere that it amounts to theft which jurisdictions and many individuals (barring pirates of course) finds unacceptable. Furthermore, piracy doesn't lead to innovation/betterment in/of the product, neither does it, primarily, gives any insight, technical or otherwise, in the software. It further would cause legal ramifications for our site, so we steer clear from it. 

The date-time issue in the linked question is a flaw in the app (no matter if it is prevalent in various apps) and the OP intends to use that for personal gains. Leaving aside any violation of intellectual property (IP) of the developer, I think OP's actions amount to theft if the software is a paid one. For me, that is an unethical practice and I would not support it if the motives are clear or the app or its features has to be bought.

But, what if the app was free for use forever? What if OP decided to see the behavior of the app when the date-time or something else is tweaked?  What if the app couldn't handle this and force-stops or produces garbage output on screen? There involves plain and simple curiosity at their side. But, though no theft of potential money is involved, there may be a violation of somebody's IP. 

Consider SHAREit as an example. Assume that you don't like the shipped user profile icons set and wants to add more into it. Say SHAREit does not offer one, neither would it in the near future. Now, you decided to take things in your hands. You found that you need not to disassemble its APK to add more images since the data directory of the app has them at a dedicated location. You just added more of your icons there, restarted the app, and voila! objective completed.2

But, SHAREit's Terms of Service (TOS) notes:


  You will not, nor allow third parties on Your behalf (i) to resell or charge others for use of the Application (ii) to duplicate, disassemble, decompile, transfer, exchange or translate the Application, create derivative works of the Application of any kind whatsoever or attempt to reverse engineer, alter or modify any part of the Application    


(Emphasis mine)

They say that TOS is binding legal agreement subjected to jurisdiction of courts in Beijing. Now, if you're outside the Chinese jurisdiction, you may not consider the modifications illegal because you as a sovereign would be subjected to only those laws your State has ratified or promulgated.  However, what about ethics? 


Are you not violating a contract that you have with somebody? 
Did you take their consent to modify the app for your purposes, even if non-commerical they may be? 


There is definitely a clear violation of IP which hurts their interests over yours.

So I leave this to you to ponder about: just because there is not a paid product involved, do you find the modification ethical at the cost of IP? Did you consider that IP finds its  place and protection in http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/udhr/article_27.htmlUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.



Now, as a member of the community, where do I stand than?


If I'm convinced that product or its features has to be paid for, I would downvote and close vote because I don't want the developers to suffer monetarily at the cost of my curiosity or of asker's. If there is an answer, I would flag it for moderator intervention. Their judgement would stand final of course. 
If the product is free for use, then I consider case-by-case approach. My very limited experience tells me that developers (Corp./Org./Companies,etc.) often do not legally chase away just anyone any time. When there is considerable damage to them, say brand image being tarnished, or product used for anti-social/anti-national/illicit activities, or monetary damage of some kind, or some alike cases, only then they come into action. 

It is when any of this has been established I consider it unethical for myself to support app's modifications publically through knowledge dissemination. However, I don't find it unethical to modify the app if the knowledge to do so remains with me or when I'm unaware of the aforesaid developments taking place.

The reason I use case-by-case approach is because I cannot trade my curiosity for somebody's IP every time. Curiosity is my driving force to hang around on this site and post working answers and gain satisfaction and ultimately, end up helping people along the way. 


1: I'm neither supporting free software ideology nor opposing the use of proprietary software. 
2: This is purely hypothetical. No violation of TOS took place for this answer.

Their judgement would stand final of course." Since this can be read in two ways, I thought I'd make it clear that we're not here to judge whether things are OK or not: we only try to determine whether a particular question or answer is in line with the policy that the community agrees here on meta.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And here comes a question asking our help to break down some files of an app. https://android.stackexchange.com/q/181219/96277 Ethics is just too broad a thing.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this answer, as it becomes very subjective very quickly as to what constitute "unethical", as a hacker, I know that what we do can be used for good or bad, depends on what the knowledge gained is used to achieve. For example, for all we know the person wants to know if this can be done so they can protect their own app they are creating against it, that doesn't make it unethical. If someone finds it unethical, then they should just not participate, that's all; shouldn't be closed or censored from everyone else who might have a reason to participate in it, without justifying it.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree with this answer but the ShareIt example could not necessarily be the best one. That portion of the TOS is completely invalid, thus void (or null, or whatever the word is in English) in all of the EU countries.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndreaLazzarotto I've already written that the individual outside the Chinese jurisdiction would be subject to the laws your State/Authority has enacted and/or ratified (EU countries for some folks). I was focusing more on the ethical side of the agreement, not on the legal one. Though it may be so you implied that nullification of a law also nullifies ethical contexts, but I'm not sure on that.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord preventing reverse engineering on a legitimately held application is unethical itself. But anyways the original question was not really talking about reversing.

The point on the question from the headline is about changing the date/time in one app, not about piracy.

The whole text is about piracy, and that is what makes the question a bad example for the real question here. In principle, you will often encounter questions with a technical and neutral question, which has one paragraph of motivation which is not ethical. Like when this question would be framed as



Introduction:


  I have a trial version of an app and like to continue using it after the trial period.


Question (about date/time settings):


  To do so, I would like to change date and time on the phone, but only for this app. Is there a way to do it without changing the source of the app?


While other cases are more clear:


  how can I continue using a trial version after the trial period? Any hint welcome, I just do not want to change the time for every app on the phone to do so.


Actual question: How do I evade the trial period?



In the end, you should not forget, that a question about how to evade the trial period in this way even comes handy for the app author, which learns how users avoid his restriction in the app. The knowledge is there anyway and if it is not answered here, it will be answered elsewhere. But here it is visible for everybody, including the victim of the piracy.

So it is kind of full disclosure (in computer security terms) to have an answer here, which can be used by the next author of a trial app to avoid making it too easy to keep using the app after the trial period.

And then there is @liljoshu's point: Where do the ethics begin and where do they stop?

Avoiding trial periods costs the author money, so it is not ethical. What about ad blocking? And finally, some app authors are making money by selling your data. Do you want to prevent people from asking how they can protect their data against apps, which sell your data? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"Avoiding trial periods costs the author money" Not quite. First, it doesn't *cost* the author money, because the author does not have less money than they would have had if OP never existed. At most, it *denies* the author theoretical future money that they might have gained later. To equate that with *cost* implies that, for example, my decision to eat at home today *costs* McDonald's money. It would be different if the author actually incurred some individual cost in order for the trial to be installed on that user's device. Secondly, in order to legitimize the assertion that the author...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...has even been denied *future* money would require that OP would have purchased the app if they did not find a way to avoid the trial. But it's entirely possible (I would even say quite likely) that in that scenario, the user would simply discontinue using the app after the trial, which puts the author in no different financial position. Now, if OP were to share the method with others, or if we gave an answer and then OP disclosed the app in question and confirmed that the answer worked, *then* there would be a greater potential for cost to the author, as it's far more likely that someone...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...who *finds* the answer here, and would otherwise have purchased the app, to instead use the answer found, than it is that the OP, who *actively took steps* to obtain a bypass method, is actually a potential purchaser.


















I tried to create a new tag, related to part 2 of my question, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/m2-01alm2-01al.

I typoed it and the correct name is https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/m2-a01lm2-a01l or uppercase if it fits.

Possibility to rename? I don't edit tag privileges yet

Every Android device model is identified by a device code that is widely used (and potentially Googled, or at least returns a lot of results) among specialists/professionals.

E.g. Samsung Galaxy S3 is known with code GT-I9300, Motorola Nexus 6 is shamu, Huawei MediaPad M2 10.0 as M2-A01L

For the record, I have just tried to create a tag m2-a01l (typoed, I have a related question on renaming).

My question here is: does it have sense to create tags and/or synonims according to the device model code to help search engines find questions/answer on that model?

Consider that I took some time to start searching for shamu rooting, m2-a01l stock firmware etc. A number of topics on xda report the model code for the device in their [tags], but XDA is a technical forum while Android SE is for everyone.

Those searches are mainly related to ROM stuff. I don't think people search for how to uninstall app in shamu, shamu broken glass

To be more clear in my question, it is my opinion that advanced users may also want to search for content by the model code, while everyday Android users/enthusiast may just prefer to use the model name

Any thoughts?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Could it have sense to tag devices by their device code?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thought: How many of our users do you think know their device's code name? I know it for one of my devices. Without giving an exact number: I have definitely more than one device. And with many users we can be glad if they can specify more than just "Samsung". Apart from that, it's not an exception if "almost similar devices" are grouped into one tag, as otherwise we'd end up with too many tags without meaning (used by less than 5 questions).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't think synonyms would have any impact on search results, so if that's the main reason for this suggestion I'm skeptical that it would be very useful. They don't appear anywhere in a question or its tags, they simply get translated into the "parent" tag, so I' not sure how a search engine would even know that a question's tags have any synonyms. Aside from that, I would agree with Izzy that the majority of users have no idea what their device codenames are.

I don't actually participate on the main site much, so I held my tongue the first the first few times I saw this question, but... disallowing developing-on-Android questions simply because of the word "development" feels like an incredibly prescriptivist view of the rules to me.

Setting aside the the specific main site post that led to this question, and looking at the general case: this site is for people who are using Android devices, rather than developing for Android devices. Whether writing a program on an Android device, playing a game on an Android device or watching a movie on an Android device, the person involved is acting as a user of the device, not a developer of that device. For all we know, the development taking place may not be for that device at all, or even be mobile-related; after a few minutes of searching, I found Android-based IDEs for C++, JavaScript and C#.

Over the past few days, a particular user have been submitting a lot of suggested edits (both on the main site and Meta) that changes all SE links in the post from http to https - example https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/181527here.

While I agree that such edits are generally beneficial security-wise, I recall that when the shift to https happened, the site automatically did most of the modifications, and thus I think such type of changes should be left for the site management system, rather than being a chance to accumulate edit count and rake in renown.

What's your opinion on this?

P.S. I personally still approved all such edits to this date.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Is this kind of suggested edit encouraged?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As the other approver on that (and probably other) suggested edits i'm interested in the 'answer' to this too. I think the edits were correct and valid so approved too. IMO as long as it's not lots of single http -> https link edits then they're fine.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As for "leave it to the system": AFAIK that was a one-time task and won't be repeated. Furthermore, there's HSTS configured, so even clicking a `http://` link will end up on the `https://` counterpart – which means, strictly speaking, such edits are not really necessary (though they don't hurt either – except from, maybe, flooding our front-page). I don't really object to such edits as long as the amount stays reasonable, though.


















Edits to posts are completely unnecessary. As you suspect, the site updated those links automatically when the switchover occurred.

The edits you've been seeing lately are to tag wikis. https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/300235/222389The request was already made on the global meta to automatically update these to HTTPS, so this will probably happen at some point.

As people have already been warned on that question not to waste reviewers' time by suggesting edits on tag wikis (when they don't have enough rep to do it unilaterally), it's perfectly OK for you to reject those suggested edits to discourage that behaviour.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yeah, I was actually rejecting such edits because of the same reason but than today I observed that I was the only rejecting them, so I kind of stepped  back from reviewing edits and wondered whether I reviewed them wrongly?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I actually started to rethink my own decision after I saw you rejecting the edits - that's the motive behind this question.

I was the user doing the job. As I heard from this meta post, I stopped the activity on the spot.

As a precaution, I stopped it also on other sites, where it didn't cause any negative feedbacks, and the edit suggestions were quickly accepted.

A more recent https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300235/convert-http-links-to-https-in-tag-wikis#comment976002_300235comment in the related MSE post, from an SE insider, indicates that an automatized solution from the SE to the problem likely won't happen in the foreseeable future. It has a technical reason: the fixup, what they used, use their internal elastic search engine, which doesn't index the tag wikis. Thus, the suspection that it could be done easily by improving their http -> https conversion script, is unfortunately false.

I collected the tags containing internal http links with https://data.stackexchange.com/android/query/716656/tag-wikis-with-internal-http-linksthis, since then a little bit improved SEDE query.

On the Android SE, there are around 110 tag wikis back. On most other sites, particularly on smaller betas, I could finish the task in a single rush.

A user, without tag wiki edit privilege, can have at most 5 edit suggestions coincidently (20 on betas). Over it, the "edit" link doesn't appear in the tag wiki pages any more. The "Submit" clicks on the already edited tag wikis fail with an error message. In my opinion, this flow control should be enough to defend the review queue from an overload, but I accept the community consent.

Anybody having the tag wiki edit privilege could finish the job without loading the review queue. You can get the list of the tag wikis to fix by the refered SEDE query. This is not really the funniest task working with computers, but the data to process is really not too big. And once it has to be done.

I am sorry for the trouble - hopefully I will be more productive for you in the near future, with real, positively scored, main site posts. :-)

P.s. the small count of the problematic tags avoids to get any significant rep/badges with the edits. Beside that, I edited not only the main, but also on the meta sites.

Continuing /q/2321the question about ethics, I'm worried if Freedom and Lucky Patcher, two "obviously unethical" apps, one of which allows free in-App Purchase by hijacking app's traffic to Play Store while the other hacks games and apps by modifying the compiled code.

Fortunately there isn't too many questions about Freedom, but it seems like there's already a few about https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lucky-patcherlucky-patcher.

Should we help with those questions?



I can somehow remember that both F & LP aren't welcome on XDA Forum, and people there replying


  No Lucky Patcher here because this site is for developers.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are Freedom and Lucky Patcher on topic for this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If I may, XDA is with the developers and against the users. As previously stated, I do not condone slackers, but nobody here "helps" users but certain pirates.


















Not being a gamer I've never heard about Freedom, so I cannot talk about that. LP on the other hand has some very good and "ethical" features, but one can be very much tempted using a few of them in an unethical way (which is why I stopped using it years ago, after having given it a short try). It's sometimes a bit too tempting, so I have no clear "advice" here. Nevertheless, a possible approach could be:


NO if the question is explicitly for the "unethical part"
YES if the question is clearly on the "path of virtue"


That's quite "black and white", and the hard part is where to draw the line. As phrased in my bullet points, there's a wide "no man's land" in between which is likely to lead to debates on "why is this one closed and the other one not". So while I'm pretty sure about the "NO" part, I don't know if we should vote for the other half.

But that's not the point here :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As previously stated on the first question about ethics, there's no way to parametrize ethics itself. Any attempt to do so results in more censorship (XDA), and I don't think that we do need any more of it. For example, I used Lucky Patcher to patch WhatsApp, back when I used it, in order to protect my privacy while being able to see when someone read my messages. For someone, this may be unethical, but for me it was not. I propose that we let those questions stay; if one has the answer and wishes to write it, good for them. The system does already purge inactive questions after a while.


















As everyone knows, back in the CyanogenMod days, we flagged questions about nightly releases, as they used to become obsolete fairly quickly and were too unstable to discuss.

Now, a similar situation presents itself to us: unofficial Xposed releases. As can be read in https://www.xda-developers.com/flashable-xposed-framework-android-nougat/this XDA post, unofficial Xposed flashable .zip files are now a reality  for those who wish an early taste of Xposed on Nougat. While this may seem fantastic for the most adventurous of us, it also brings up a whole new array of issues which cannot be thoroughly classified. As rovo89, developer of Xposed, puts it,


  The worst thing about this is that the exact behavior would depend on
  the ROM, or even how the user uses the device (now that apps are
  compiled based on profiles). Modules would fail randomly and the
  module developers would be wondering what they did wrong (answer:
  nothing). If not all of the prerequisites are fulfilled, it’s a pretty
  unreliable API.


It's evident that we, as well as module devs, would not be able to address questions about devices with said Xposed flavor. Most importantly, even if we did, such questions wouldn't even be consistent among users with the same device.

Given the above, what stance should we take about questions featuring unofficial Xposed variants? Note that this won't just apply to Xposed for Nougat, but for any unofficial Xposed in the future.

What?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug From the above, `Note that this won't just apply to Xposed for Nougat, but for *any* unofficial Xposed in the future`.


















As with the CyanogenMod nightlies, or any "pre-beta" ROM, they should be closed. The problem, whatever it happens to be, is probably not widely applicable, and is likely to be fixed in the short term. That makes the question virtually useless for future readers.

Just close them.

The problem is, that we lack a default flag option for these cases.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The site can only define so many default off-topic options. A custom option is more than sufficient.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Excellent. I shall wait until more attention to the topic has been garnered, or until tomorrow, and then I'll accept this answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Answer accepted, since the upvotes denote a pretty good consensus.


















I do share the same sentiments at times, sometimes it's worth sharing the feedback to the poster of the answer so that the author may be assured their post was helpful.

Honestly I think  getting feedback from time to time is very important.  Some users indeed put so much effort and time their when acquiring and researching information when posting answer to assist the asker in the best way possible, so its really encouraging to get feedback from the asker on the whether the given answer was helpful or not (its not necessarily about upvoting or anything) but just a comment is worth it.

Of course time won't permit every user to do that, in that case its okay, otherwise a small feedback will do much good to encourage users to post quality answers and reduce trash and this will help the community at large.

That aside, I totally agree with your answer. Sometimes, and when I used to answer a lot, I always expected that the poster at least provide feedback, if not accept or upvote my answer.


















Of late I have observed that a few questions have been raised, which on close inspection https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topiclook off-topic however were carrying an active bounty.

In one case, I tried to https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/181721/revisionssalvage the post with significant edits to make sure that OP could perhaps get an answer that solves their issue at least also to avoid unnecessary wastage of bounty rep (hard earned rep) from the OP's point of view. 

Recently there came another https://android.stackexchange.com/q/179860/209414post with active bounty which I reckon can be deemed https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicoff-topic (asking for app recommendations), but in this case I am not too sure how this can be handled. I also think the OP was looking for a different way to solve the problem and not strictly app recommendation, however the investor seems to be looking for an application.

In this case how can off-topic (or low quality posts) be handled when they carry an active bounty, AFAICT, under normal circumstances, such posts are put on hold to allow OP to revise the posts (and then re-open or closed)?

Other cases including:


Posts which are unclear
Duplicates (I hardly recall a question which had active bounty but was a duplicate, and one user commented on the duplicity of the post, and initially OP didn't know this but later regretted having used their bounty on an duplicate post)

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to handle off-topic questions with active bounty?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I was thinking of a few things when I raised this question: 1. How does other users view it e.g can 3k rep users decide to close it on 5 votes?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also won't it be too harsh to close a question with active bounty, considering the user has sacrificed their rep for better answers, but in this case users will be forced to revise the post significantly and make assumptions about how OP wanted to ask the question?


















Back before June 2017 and earlier, I rarely saw the FP queue exceeding 10. But since August, I've been rarely seeing it falling under 15, sometimes growing to 60. The same is for the LQP when it has grown from 5 to 15.


b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are we losing reviewers or getting extra new users?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The FP queue was actually in the hundreds for a long time before that -- IIRC, it was mostly a specific effort from me and Izzy that brought it to 0 initially.  I definitely haven't had time to focus on it recently.


















Thanks for raising this issue. To simply answer this, I would like to attribute this to time availability. There is a fair number of users with reviewing privileges for first posts (https://stackexchange.com/leagues/54/week/android500+ rep users ≈ 430) and much less for other review queues.

Some of these users of late have not been active on the site, to perform various duties as reviewing (myself included) due to time constraints, however occasionally find time to carry out the duties wherever possible.

In conclusion there is a growing number of new users (which is good) but it's not necessary that reviewers are declining in number, only time constraints. I think other users can give more reasons why review queues are retaining lots of posts than before.

I had been an active reviewer of all queues including the First Posts, and I currently top the First Posts review stats at 5436 posts reviewed. In the past I always clear the queue (or use up the daily 20 limit), but starting last month I personally no longer visit the First Posts queue. 3 reasons:


It's too time-consuming, since there's almost always a full queue everyday.
The queue is heavily mixed in type and quality, whereas the posts in Close Votes and LQ Posts are almost always in need of action, and both those queues have a unified pattern of action, making it easier to go through.
Since flagging a post as non-answer or low quality would push it to the LQ queue at a later time, often I end up processing the same post twice.

Recently, while I was surfing the web and researching for some information for my Tasker projects, I bumped onto one of my old posts (that I posted on https://android.stackexchange.comAndroid Enthusiasts Stack Exchange) which left me wondering how this post had found its way onto random sites with exactly the same content?

I had posted the question; https://android.stackexchange.com/q/170790/209414Automatically disable mobile hotspot when no device is connected, using Tasker, but later found the question on these sites:


http://eadiscussion.com/index.php?threads/automatically-disable-mobile-hotspot-when-no-device-is-connected-using-tasker.7490/#post-7490http://eadiscussion.com/index.php?threads/automatically-disable-mobile-hotspot-when-no-device-is-connected-using-tasker.7490/#post-7490

to mention a few...

My question is, is this kind of behavior allowed or has Stack Exchange given permission to such sites in order to republish the  content? To my surprise there is even no referral link to the SE site from where the content was extracted and also the sites have no convincing detail that reveal their affiliation with SE (if any)?

Please note that I have no problem with people using my information on thier websites, but I am a bit amused as to why this information is appearing on the sites as if they a sub-sites to Android SE, and even more funnier they also have a tags :)

The MSE post you linked has all the things covered.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I apologise for duplicate, it wasn't intended, had not encountered that post before


















Over the last hours https://android.stackexchange.com/users/241528/thunder-boltone particular user has posted a series of answers under app-related questions. While the answer themselves are not always completely unrelated to the question itself (I'm being conservative here), all of them has one or more links, either claimed to point to "premium" app downloads or video guides, but all wrapped in a revenue-generating (advertisement) URL shortener.

(Not to mention the download links are hosted under Google Drive, which does not guarantee the safety of the source; by "premium" and "cracked" this also implies piracy; those are separate issues)

For now I've flagged all answers from him that doesn't address the question itself properly as VLQ. I'm thinking of flagging all as spam as well, but at the same time it doesn't seem to fit well. I will also edit all these answers to remove the layer of URL shortener to directly expose the link if it's proper (regardless of whether it's on point - leaving it for other reviewers who are seeing my flags), or remove the link altogether if it's related to app piracy.

With Stack Exchange's editor, I don't believe a URL shortener is necessary in the first place, let alone one that could make money off the visitors to the site.

What's your stance on this?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Paid / revenue-generating URL shortener - what's the site's stance?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If one still needs one, there's [Google's own shortener](https://goo.gl/) out there, thus there are no excuses in case of redirecting users through a pile of adware, in my opinion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As it turns out, most of the answers you were concerned about were plagiarised from other sites, and the links were irrelevant anyway. In hindsight, editing the links wasn't the right thing to do in this case, and flagging for mod attention would have solved the problem quicker and with less effort.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme Understood. I raised VLQ for the majority of answers, but since the time at which I discovered the problem was supposedly nighttime for westerners (time zone difference), the flag won't be processed fast enough, and I figured I should at least deal with the links quickly to control short-term damage.


















Every now and then, we do see some question like https://android.stackexchange.com/q/185354/152843this one, which revolves around trust issues in a couple, asking us to collaborate as to "unmask" the unfaithful party.

I personally believe that the users of our site should not concern themselves with this sort of questions, belief that makes my question rather similar to iBug's https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2321/152843one.

The difference, is that questions which are unethical may very well be of use in the future, whilst those similar to the one in the first paragraph, are probably not.

What is everyone's take on the matter? Should questions whose context is trust issues be closed or ignored, or should any potential answerer decide by their own accord whether to answer or not?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Questions revolving around trust issuesb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Trouble with those is, they're not strictly off-topic – though most of them would better see a therapist. The one you linked is indeed close to iBugs concern, as it explicitly asks for help to commit a crime (computer fraud; breaking into someone's else's computer in order to extract data). If there were 5 close votes, I'd not intervene …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Pardon, did not see the reply. So, you suggest not to take action?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5See my comment on Dan's answer: I'm simply unsure how to deal with it. I fully agree with Dan for the "usual suspects" – but the first question you've linked is a special case in itself …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Indeed. This was a matter I wished to bring up sooner, but I decided to procrastinate. My take on all of this, is that we might want to avoid acting, and let the system itself clean up the question as it gets obsolete. Still, as the topic overlaps with what iBug talked about, it seems to me that any potential answerer should weigh the pros and cons by themselves. Cases like this are not parametrizable.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If @Izzy or someone else wants to write an extra answer that's maybe more specific to the linked question, that would be good. I don't want to have the only opinion on the table!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@DanHulme As I wrote, I mostly agree with what you wrote. And I'm unsure about that specific case, as it slightly deviates from the general one. Which doesn't make an answer :)


















It's not for us to judge people's relationships, so in cases like this, I'd prefer to "look through" to the Android question, and ignore the context completely.

The most frequent example of this kind of question is the "inaccurate location history" question, for which we have a canonical question. If the core of the question is about whether location history can be wrong, we typically close as a duplicate of that one, regardless of how hysterical the question is or whether the point of view is "my spouse is cheating on me" or "my spouse thinks I'm cheating on them".

For questions like the one you linked, don't forget that cheating and divorce are real things, and especially in divorce cases, the facts of who did what when can be important legal evidence. If it were a solicitor or detective asking how to get evidence from the phone legally, or trying to establish if use of particular information could possibly stand up in court, I think we'd try to help them the best we can, and I'd like to see people have that same attitude regardless of who asks the question.

I'm going to examine things from this point of view for a bit.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good points indeed, Dan. Just with the first question linked, I have my problem even "looking through to the Android question" – as it effectively asks for advice on performing an illegal activity, intruding in someone else's "computer". To me, that's beyond "gray area". I'm not sure how to deal with that: as often pointed out, we're not advocates …b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5'D better edit the background out as it's unrelated to the specific Android problem, before closeing as dupt.

I'm looking for the data files of one of the apps I use on my phone.

It occurred to me that such questions might not be allowed on the site from my experience of the varying rules from one SE site to another.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Are questions about where certain apps store their data permitted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5First I'd say you should go ahead and use the site search.

Lately a few people have asked about a particular malware app. It's named "Chromes" to disguise it as a genuine app, "Chrome". The problem is, when you search for "Chromes" on the site, the search engine returns a lot of results about "Chrome": it's applying stemming to the name.

As a result, we get lots of duplicate questions about the same malware, and it's hard for reviewers to find the original question to mark as duplicate. It also means the "Related questions" aren't relevant at all.

Is there a way we can avoid stemming for this particular word, so that when people are searching for "Chromes" malware, they get relevant results? Or is there some other workaround to help people find relevant questions and avoid posting duplicates?

We have quite a few questions about the various "power saving mode" features in different phones. Some of them are about the feature in base Android available since Marshmallow or so. Others are about the "ultra power saving mode" that seems to be a Samsung-specific features. The existing questions seem to be mostly tagged with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/powerpower, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/battery-lifebattery-life, or (erroneously) with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-optionspower-options.

Should we add a new https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-saving-modepower-saving-mode tag?

I just joined Stack Exchange in order to answer a question. I discovered I was not allowed to because I have no reputation. Fair enough; I can understand the caution. However it creates a Catch-22.
That Catch-22 is best illustrated by the automated welcoming email I received from Stack Exchange a bit later:

The Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange community only works because users like you generously share their knowledge to solve each other's problems.
Want to help?
Find a question you can answer.
Other users will vote up your answer if they find it helpful.
For every upvote, you earn reputation, which unlocks additional privileges on the site.

Unfortunately you need reputation BEFORE you are allowed to answer a question. But the only way to earn reputation appears to be to answer a question.???
What am I missing?
And I've just discovered I can only post once every 40 minutes. Okay, I shall wait long enough to post this but won't likely be back. If I'm going to contribute it's typically in a single session that in total may be far less than 40 minutes.

  Unfortunately you need reputation BEFORE you are allowed to answer a question.


Usually it doesn't work like that. But a small number of questions attract a lot of non-answers by new users. Especially with questions that rank high on Google, people will create an account just to post "yeah, this problem is awful! we need an answer!" or "thanks to the other answerers!" - posts which people are used to from forum sites, but don't fit on our Q&A site at all. Those questions get specially protected. Brand new users can't answer them any more, to avoid inundating the site with non-answers.

Although it's a shame this happens, it's a tiny fraction of questions, and it only affects brand new users. You only need one upvote on an answer, or two on a question, or one answer being accepted, before you can answer a protected question, so any useful contribution at all will get you past this block. It's just to reduce the extra work caused by the 95% of people who come here only to create noise, so the rest of us can get on with helping each other.

It's the position of the word ***only*** that matters.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess native English speakers don't care so much as foreign speakers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug I don't think many native speakers would make that distinction in this case. "They only *x* to *y*" is much more likely to mean that *y* is the only reason, with different phrasing used for the other case. Foreign speakers tend to view English syntax as more logical and coherent then how natives actually speak it. All the same, I do try to be clear for everyone, so thanks for your edit.


















The post that you wanted to edit looked like this:



This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. 


I run the following command via Termux Task plugin.

I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use <pre> and </pre> at the beginning of first line and end of last line.

E.g. 

<pre>


LINE1
LINE2


<pre>

If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before <pre> to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g.

Usually you can follow the introductionary 3 by the format, e.g. `html`, to have syntax highlighting – but that doesn't work on all SE sites.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy thanks for the input


















When chatting in Tavern on the Meta, someone https://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/6572200#6572200said this:


  10K views, no votes on question or answer. Typical for Android site.


That message really hit me by heart.

It's a grassland full of grass, but no tall grass. It's a forest full of trees, but no apples. It's a site where people from all around the world come to ask, but only a few people are answering and voting, and nothing else. The questions get posted, and get answered from the few of us, left at a net score of zero or one, and so do the answers. Despite https://stackexchange.com/sites#trafficour traffic ranking top 10 among all SE sites, we get far fewer up/down votes on posts, and far fewer comments and discussion. We have 7k+ Tumbleweed badges with no more than 190k questions, while Stack Overflow has less than 950k that badge among >45M questions. We get more than one T badge for every 30 Q, and this ratio is increased by half on SO. Meta Stack Exchange has less than 600 Tumbleweeds among 300k questions (it's hyperactive).



Most people with 2k+ reputation, as well as a few below 2k, have been very active on this site for a long time. You are undoubtably the firm supporters of this site. But https://stackexchange.com/leagues/54/all/androidlook, we have only 79 users with 2k+ rep, and 1,726 users with 200+, among 152k users. Only 1.16% of all users are getting avid. https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/all/stackoverflow/Compared to Stack Overflow, 387k out of 8.2M has 200+ rep, with a net "avid rate" of 4.71%, 40x as we have.

As eldarerathis pointed out in comments, discussion about site promotion has been a topic since 2011, when this site had just guaduated from Beta. The Community Manager Shog9 https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/578/205764wanted us to maintain a sustainable growth.

Everyone that has been active are still active, but we aren't quite reliable. The number of us is too few. We attract a lot of users every day, but we can't maintain a sustainable growth of avid users. In long run this could be a problem. So, do, or shall we, put some effort to make this site look more active, so we have a real activity that catches up with our traffic?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can we spend some effort on improving our overall activity?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I must admit, that other Android sites are also in a similar problem, according ti my observation. Like XDA, Android Central, the Android part of Reddit, etc. The best among them is XDA, because new developers are born every day, so they can maintain a stable growth of user activity. Reddit and Android Central are very similar to us, with new users coming and asking every day.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I started my activity on SE on this site, but the flagship site, Stack Overflow, is way too active, and earning reputation and learning new stuff is moderately easy and fast there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You know how much effort I spent before my rep on SO surpassed that here? One single month of half the activity earned me 3.5k on SO, despute the fact that I have written more bad answers there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I can't find the article as of now, but this reminds me of a 10k rep person who left StackOverflow back in the day, complaining (among other things) that earning reputation was too trivial.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5If we lack curious people who like to experiment and find answers by themselves, I reckon that answering questions will fall on our shoulders, pal.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 for analysis and articulation. I too often felt it is the (few) regulars . For some reason our middle order (to use a cricketing term) is weak. I my be wrong, but I noticed that even first time users seem to less often returning to checkb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5We actually had a pretty lengthy discussion about the lack of the "middle-class" here waaaay back [in 2011](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/578/you-need-the-bourgeois-blues?noredirect=1&lq=1).  It's been a difficult problem to cope with, and one that (I believe) is exacerbated a bit by the fact that there tends to be a pretty big imbalance when it comes to end-user type problems. Unlike SO which is (in theory, at least) devs helping devs, we tend to be "power users" helping "casual users"...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5...In other words, not only is everyone operating on different levels, we're not even in the same general vicinity as one another. At *lot* of people just want to use their devices, and don't want to worry about understanding the intricacies of how Android functions. On the flip side, everyone on SO has some kind of ostensible interest in how development happens. The result is that here we have a mass of users who tend to answer, and a (much much) larger mass who tend to ask.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@beeshyams I like it when you talk about cricket :) but seriously I think there isn't much feedback in the community (in fact you've mentioned this before:. [I have deleted my answer, since there was no feedback from you as requested](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2259/209414) which I do support). Also I think most users have favourite tags that they participate in and to focus mostly on these such that when a typical question comes its gets lots of attention e.g comments, upvotes etc whilst other do not easily receive as much, hence can have 10k views without even a comment.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you for your feedback. I replaced the mentioning part with a vague one so everyone is equal now.


















The Nokia smartphones have come to the market, and a lot of people are using them.

In Android Enthusiasts SE, we are finding questions on Nokia smartphones. https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=NokiaThis search reveals the questions that are on Nokia smartphones.

So, it is quite evident that a tag for Nokia is needed. I believe that rather than making tags for each version of Nokia smartphones, firstly we should make a tag on Nokia itself: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nokianokia, like there is one on Samsung: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/samsungsamsung. Later, we can go forth and make tags on the popular versions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Tag request: Nokiab2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As you have the [required 300 rep](https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-tags) I'd say go ahead – sounds reasonable, as we also have tags for other manufacturers. But as with those, this should be a fallback only if there's no more (device) specific tag, so you might wish to go for those as well (make sure to skip the non-Android devices ;) For a slimmer list, [here's an adjusted search](https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=Nokia+is%3Aq+duplicate%3Ano+closed%3Ano). Didn't filter out "invalid devices" though.


















I came across two suspicious suggested edits today:


https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/189170https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/189170
https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/189177https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/189177


Looks much like audits. What happened?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5A... Au... Audit?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, you two audited well. All I see is an anonymous user "vandalizing" some posts, and two reviewers rightfully rejecting those edits. Did I miss something?


















The bounty amount is deducted from your reputation when the bounty starts, not when it's awarded. For the particular example you mentioned, you can see exactly what happened on the https://android.stackexchange.com/users/218308/curio?tab=reputationreputation tab of that user's profile. They started with 1 like everyone else, got +100 of association bonus, and then spent it on the bounty to get back to 1 rep. They also got an upvote on the question taking them up to 6.

Spending one's association bonus to bounty one's first question on a new site is pretty common but it's quite unfortunate, because https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231498/stack-exchange-doesnt-allow-me-to-answer-protected-questions-because-i-gave-awayou have to get all the way back up to 110 reputation before you can answer protected questions.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, I used to think that it would be deducted when the bounty is awarded.


















You must at least permit stackexchange.com and stackoverflow.com. Probably also sstatic.net and ajax.googleapis.com. Those are the four I whitelisted for Android.SE. It also asks for googletagservices.com and google-analytics.com. The last one at least can be safely left out. Then there's googleusercontent.com which it most likely requires as well (else I hadn't whitelisted that).

Funnily, fewer of those are required for Meta …
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you very much.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@bobn if that solved your issue, don't forget to "accept" the answer (ticking the check-mark next to it) to indicate so to other users :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'll have to be at home to try it.  won't be there for a while.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No prob, @bobn – just don't forget then :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Addkin ajax.googleapis.com did it.  Thanks. 

Just as a note, *not* having google follow me around the internet is part of why I installed uBlock Origin in the first place.  It's a shame that eveybody can't host all the pieces of code that make their websites work.

(Not that I really mind google knowing I'm at stackexechange, it's the principle of the thing.)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My feelings exactly. One can *partly* work around that using [Decentral Eyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/) (which provides the most common scripts like JQuery locally and rewrites the page code accordingly – would fit here as ajax.googleapis.com is mainly referenced for JQuery). You could give that a try. // Sidenote: On all of my web sites I take care to use external resources as little as possible. Especially no JavaScript from the "outer world".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug Why would they need JS? Only if one wants to upload images I guess. But no, sorry: I've not made an exception for that (neither do I see a block for it), and still can deal with those pics. So what makes you think it's needed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug Again: I see no blocks for Imgur here. And yes, I do see those avatars – which btw. come from Gravatar afaik in most cases. Ah, mine comes from i.stack.imgur.com – and yes, I see it. But neither uMatrix nor NoScript show any JS loaded from there or blocked from there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug that's what OP asked about, isn't it: "JavaScript from another domain … Please state specifically what the other domain is"? :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OP might clarify. Reading it again, that's a bit "opinion based" – depending what you count as "this site to work". Strictly speaking, it *works* well without avatars – but *looks* nicer with #D


















I have one question.

Should questions about "How to root X" without a clear answer, or with at least one clear answer stating the device is not rootable and no valid rooting method provided in another answer, be added to the list?

The list says "How do I root my device", so I doubt the usefulness of questions without clear answers and models stated to be non-rootable (at the moment).

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/24436/my-android-device-has-been-splashed-soaked-by-sea-waterMy android device has been splashed/soaked by sea water
Has an accepted answer that says:

next, submerge the phone (without the battery) completely in water.
Leave it there for 24 hours.

It doesn't take a genius to realize that putting a water damaged phone in water will just make it worse.
I suggested an edit that removed the parts of the answer that actually damage hardware.  I cited a credible source that explains the proper way to clean water damaged electronics. I've worked in the small electronics repair industry and I personally know the correct way to clean electronics and also how to destroy them.
It is our duty to protect our visitors and users from destroying their devices.

I did the "recommended" action of providing the correct answer. Nobody will ever see this answer as it's buried beneath 3 destructive answers that destroy electronics.
The destructive answers receive more upvotes and the correct answer receives no attention.
It makes sense at this point to just edit the accepted answer and remove the parts that are dangerous and destructive. The answer owner doesn't lose any rep, everyones happy.

TLDR: This accepted answer is equal to delete System32 to speed up your computer.
This wouldn't fly on any other part of stack exchange why is it okay here?
Why isn't my edit accepted?

https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Don%27t_Put_Your_Device_in_Rice._Here%27s_Why...This is a citation for why rice is a myth and the proper way to clean water damage. Rice doesn't fix water damage or help at all in anyway. It's pseudoscience
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How are we allowed to have answers that will destroy all devices?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree that 24 hours is insane, and that the answer ought to be clear that you need to use distilled water as one of the other answers is, but I'm not sure what the best way forward is here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@MatthewRead My suggested edit replaced "submerge in water for..." with "submerge in ultrasonic cleaner for 6 minutes"  And the part of putting it in rice after taking it apart, I replaced with the word rice with "brush with alcohol."  The whole answer didn't need to be changed. I just suggested to reword the dangerous parts. I don't see whats wrong with that. The guy keeps his rep and new users don't mess up their electronics.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5From Meta.SE https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/11474/308746 > [You edit to make things better, clearer, more effective -- **never to change meaning**](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/11476/308746)


















If you have a better answer, post it. Explain what should and should not be done, and why. Downvote any wrong answers you see. Comment on their flaws when applicable.

But don't try to change someone else's answer to say what they did not intend to say. Respect the original author even while disagreeing with them. 

Contrary to your claim, there are many dangerously wrong answers on other sites, such as Stack Overflow. Following someone's wrong advice regarding information security can be much worse than destroying a phone. Those answers still exist. When there's is a dangerous misconception around, it's better for it to be voiced and refuted than never be voiced.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That's what I did and it's not helpful. I posted an answer and it rests at the very bottom of the question and receives no attention. While the dangerous accepted answer receives more upvotes. There are 2 other answers besides mine and they also give destructive advice.  Nobody is going to scroll down past 3 long answers that say the same thing to see the "correct" answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1. I completely agree. Gross inaccuracies or blatant incorrectness cannot be held as an excuse to go ahead and change the intent of the post. Post a competing answer and optionally, post a comment on the question highlighting why your answer should be considered first  over others. The latter suggestion may seem like abuse of commenting privilege though, but it appears to be a better choice to me.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 very similar views on [Superuser Meta](https://meta.superuser.com/q/12866/630136)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord That's a stupid idea because you have to read all of the incorrect answer and then happen to read the one comment that says that the accepted answer is wrong then scroll too the bottom of the page past 3 other wrong answers to get to the correct answer.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord You're basically saying leave it up to chance that they might possibly see the correct answer but they probably wont. That's your suggestion.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LateralTerminal your stance on that idea doesn't have any bearing on the restraints fixed around the editing. You're implicitly assuming that the visitor is stupid enough to go ahead with the first answer without checking the underlying comments or the competing answers. I don't assume that and I believe neither did the folks who set out those restraints (reflected in the idea you considered stupid) which are enforced SE wide.....b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@LateralTerminal ...In person, as much as folks often prefers not to trust any information given from a stranger without at least verifying them from other folks, the visitors are supposed to verify the answer by checking the comments, looking at the accepted-answer mark, or by reading competing answers *et al*. I believe you should raise this as an issue on  meta.se since the problem as you perceive it can exist on any SE site.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I respect your opinion but I disagree. I don't believe most people do what we expect/want them to do.  Either way this particular problem solved itself with SE's methodology and I'm happy. I think abandoned accounts are a different matter though. But that's for another day.



















Related question https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2080/131553Adding a template question to the Ask Question box. Perhaps such changes are not possible unless it's a global change across all SE sites
Questions having the phrase I am working on app or similar need not be developer oriented. That could be the reason for asking but the question may not be off topic. For instance, in this question , if OP had said he was developing an app for that device and wanted to know the path, it wouldn't make it off topic https://android.stackexchange.com/q/190216/131553Copy full system and data partitions of Oneplus 3T to computer or a better example https://android.stackexchange.com/q/18111/131553How can I do development on my Android device?
OP's are expected to search for relevant tags and if their question is related to development use https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/developmentdevelopment and if they bother to read to read the tag wiki , they would know not to ask (too much to expect, going by experience). See https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2275/131553Does [tag:development] mean "Asking for closure"?
I fully endorse that questions having code should raise a flag but it is related to the first bullet point and would like this to be implemented ASAP. Perhaps , moderators here could take this up

Unfortunately "if they bother to read to read the tag wiki" is a joke, as too many questioners don't even bother reading the excerpt.

That's why we shouldn't block them, rather the asker will be informed that this question might be off topic. `"and if they bother to read to read the tag wiki , they would know not to ask"` i was using the SE app from my day one. I didn't even know that when searching for tags, you get more info about it. Chances are, people asking questions about Android phones, are using the mobile version, which also doesn't show info about tags. Therefore Development tag should show a warning before posting


















It's almost February in 2018, which isn't supposed to be the proper time to cycle these, but for this year it'll be once again, so we'll be refreshing the Community Promotion Ads for this year now!

What are Community Promotion Ads?

Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.

Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?

This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:


interesting or fun Android apps
the site's twitter account
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in


The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. 

Why do we reset the ads every year?

Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.

The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.

How does it work?

The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. 


All answers should be in the exact form of:

[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 


Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.
The question must always be tagged with the magic /questions/tagged/community-adscommunity-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.


Image requirements


The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
Must be GIF or PNG
No animated GIFs
Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.


Score Threshold

There is a minimum score threshold an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.

You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2398here.

The first link is an FAQ from Meta Stack Exchange (aka the main meta), and the second link is an article in the Help Center. It is clearly stated that

Things about the answer itself

TLDR The answer is right.

Fairly sure I know what will go on... (I will expand this later) It does need a genius to realize that the answer is CORRECT.

The current revision of the answer has an emphasis on deionized water, which is the key that makes the answer correct. You'll actually destroy the device if you put it in some random solution, or water collected directly from your tube.

Deionized (or distilled) water contains the minimum amount ion possible in chemistry. Random ion in normal water like Calcium and Magnesium and Carbonate is going to react with the material on the PCB and the chips, which is the core cause of water damage. On the contrary deionized water is NOT going to do the same. It does not contain random ion at an amount sufficient to cause chemical reaction. Submerging an affected device in such water will lower the concentration of ion in the sea water (or whatever solution) that's already inside. This will clean off and slow down chemical reaction caused by that sea water, before the device is getting dried.

Then the answer requires you to put the device in dried rice, which is nothing wrong.

I left out the part that random ion increasing the conductivity of water because that's a really minor factor compared to the damage mentioned above.

Blah blah, whatever...aldjgskaksdhsgagkdlalajd

I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word "app" in your question.

Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site.


  Which is the best music player?


or


  Is there a good third-party SMS app?


These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying "I like such-and-such app, it's the best" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time.


  I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that?


or


  I play games on my tablet with my kid "helping" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that?


This doesn't seem like a "recommendation" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, "Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box," but more likely, it'll say "You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files," or "You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."

The difference is, you can replace "Is there an app?" with "How do I solve my problem?" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace "is there an app?" with "is there a solution?" without changing the meaning of the question.

Half a year ago I raised https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2352/205764a similar Meta post, and very fortunately the queues has been kept at a reasonable size (10~40) since then.

I just checked back here and WHOA!



The queue has far overtaken Stack Overflow's!

In the past 2~3 months I'm very glad to have seen new users becoming active and avid, as well as their generous help with this site by participating in the review queues. But it was only "the past few months", not today (and the near future, I'm afraid).

What happened to the queue(s)?

I recently started joining other SE sites, and I noticed that getting votes on answers, is much easier and faster than here. It seems like a good answer will always get upvotes.

I do understand that this site might not have as many active members as other sites do, but good answer should still get some votes, and the only reason that I can think of as to why people don't vote, is because they simply don't read answers. 

My criteria for upvoting is, if the answer is written well, and falls into one of the following, it will automatically get my upvote:


I know the answer is correct
answer was accepted by OP and being that it worked, I can safely assume that it's correct
answer is backed by reliable sources, and therefore, is most probably correct.


I try my best to upvote the answers that fall into one of the three categories, while I see that that's not done by others. Is there a reason that I'm missing?

So I'd like to hear from others, in what cases would you vote, and in what case would you avoid voting even though the answer falls into the above categories?

Hopefully this will help influence the way I, and other, answer questions.

I recently realized that there are a lot of questions asking "what is this notification icon?":

https://i.stack.imgur.com/75BO2.png

The Tour page says they are a good fit for the website:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/VI7ki.png

However, the subject is so broad, there could be 100,000 "what is this icon?" or "what does this icon mean?" questions for all the Android apps that send notifications and all the system icons.

Could there be a canonical question with a few examples (of some harder-to-guess app icons and system icons, like the Cast icon) to help cut down on these questions? It would also tell viewers to find the notification belonging to that icon and tap-and-hold it to find the app name (or look above the notification on some Android versions, like 7.x).
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Create a canonical question for "what is this icon"?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, we have [How to determine which app is creating a notification](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/20368) and [How can I deduce an app from a notification icon?](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/37443). Either we post a better canonical Q&A, or use the existing one...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Adding featured tag, so we can get enough votes here to form a consensus.


















There are some questions which follow this template:

Can you tell me what is this icon in the following image that I received from my son/daughter/wife/friend.. ?
Followed by some low resolution image (which gives us virtually nothing relevant in Google reverse image search) and sometimes they don't even bother to upload one.

I think specially this category of questions need to be closed as too broad or as "Questions asking us to find an app...are off-topic". They really are, as we cannot be expected to guess out of millions of apps for a question which doesn't seem to be worth answering  for. Why not worth it?
Such questions can easily be solved if only the asker directs their curiosity to the person who sent them the screenshot instead of directing it here. We should not serve as an alternative to the https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votesinterpersonal communication problems of people.
Furthermore, such questions are not solving a real-world problem of us. Curiosity is fine, and we do have many questions born only out of curiosity but they are mostly along the technical lines, and that often creates a boundary within which an answerer can always work and feel rewarded (generating a content that  explains something or leads to a solution is a reward in itself) even though they may never get an upvote for their efforts.
In addition, serving an answer consisting of only an app's name rewards such askers' to ask such poor questions again, then again, until we are overwhelmed with so much noise that we can't answer them anymore.
Yes, nobody is obliged to answer any of them and can ignore them through tags, but leaving the mess to continue seems irresponsible to me.
I, thus, appeal to others to consider closing at least this category of questions.
As for the ones where the asker has the icon related problem in their own phone, I agree that a canonical Q&A should be made, or the questions be closed as a duplicate to the ones mentioned by Andrew T. in his comment. If the existing answers doesn't work for the potential askers, then they should offer a bounty instead of popping up a new question.

This is the answer I'm taking about: https://android.stackexchange.com/a/202062/205764https://android.stackexchange.com/a/202062/205764

The initial revision reads


  Mim ajudem, com essa mensagem q esta aparecendo no meu lenovo z5the bootloader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed. any data stored on the device may be available to attacker, do not store any sensitive data on device


I recognized Portuguese and knew that it translated to


  Please help me with this message that's appearing on my Lenovo Z5


and flagged it as NAA after leaving a comment telling the author that they used a wrong language, as well as that the answer form was not for questions.

Izzy saw the answer and my comment, applied machine translation to the Portuguese part, got this result and declined my flag:


  I help, with this message that is appearing in my Lenovo Z5


My reason for the answer being an NAA is rather obvious: It said "please help me" with a common bootloader warning, while Izzy claimed that


  poetic license. Put this way, it's a valid answer, isn't it? "How is this a security thread?" › "any data stored on the device may be available to attacker" :)


Per my understanding, Izzy thought it was a valid answer because the BL warning contained information that could serve as an answer alone, and it could remain a valid answer with the wrong-language part translated (wrongly).

And now I disagree: While the BL message could provide some directive to an answer, it did appear in a wrong manner (coming as the error message after "please help me"). Therefore, it should not be considered as an answer, IMO. Think if the post came in English starting with "please help me" instead of an unrecognized language "mim ajudem", most people would have taken it correctly as an NAA.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Actual NAA in a wrong language considered as an answer for having relevant information?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Somehow reminds me of https://xkcd.com/810/ (https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/constructive.png) – giving the right answer with a wrong intention still results in a correct and useful answer. And sorry for my "poetic license", forgot the smiley there – it was indeed the "machine translation" leading me to assume an answer attempt. Question still remains: should we delete valid answers if given for the wrong reason? And am I wrong this is a valid answer?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Poking again, do you think the result or consensus is clear now? (I voted up both answers).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, I bow to the community. "Answer" is deleted now.


















I'm in agreement with you. It is indeed a https://source.android.com/security/images/boot_orange.pnggeneral bootloader warning. What's more? Yes, Google Translator, Bing Translator, and a voluntary translation from a trusted user on Portuguese Stack Exchange https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/46925685#46925685chat  give us the same result for the first sentence of the post, which translated to what you thought as "Help me, with this message that is appearing on my lenovo z5the bootloader is (...)"
What really follows after that sentence is not important here. I get it that we do have a policy of appreciating partial answer, but the beginning of the post already made the intention clear that it was not to serve as a partial answer. It was not even intended to be an answer by the user when the context is applied, which we must.
Even for the sake of this post we apply an exception and ignore the context, the rest of the sentence (warning that is) does not form an answer, simply because the questioner specifically mentioned in the question these two constraints:

(I am not talking of risks of unlocked boot loader. I understand that)....
I am looking for realistic threat assessment

The bootloader warning is nothing but a general and vague message (it is not even close to a realistic threat assessment which the question specifically demanded)  indicating the risks of an unlocked bootloader. Since questioner already knows it and indirectly asked not to repeat it to them, the warning, thus, does not qualify as an answer to the concerned question.
I, hence, as a fellow user, agree with your judgment.

tl;dr: NAA, it's asking for help.



Your translation is correct, Izzy's is not.

The language is not grammatically correct, but it asks:

Thank you for wanting to know. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug The grammatical mistake is just using the pronoun "mim" instead of the reflex pronoun "me". I can't explain very well the difference, but "mim" would be for indicating an indirect object where the "ajudar" verb is reflexive, and calls for the use of a "me". The "me" can be for direct or indirect objects. Abbreviating "que" to "q" and skipping accents is common in SMS and other short-writing systems, and quickly understood.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes, your suggestion is perfect. "Me ajudem com essa mensagem que está aparecendo no meu Lenovo Z5". That's pt-BR, in pt-PT you could write "Ajudem-me com esta mensagem que me está a aparecer no meu Lenovo Z5". :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thank you very much for your explanation!


















We frequently got one-liners from new users like this:


  There is an option in settings to turn off Wifi scanning which will help reduce the wifi battery usage.


To me, this would be a borderline NAA as it doesn't point out where exactly the Settings option is, but it does serve as a partial answer because it gives a direction to a potential solution to the problem.

Per my experience on Stack Overflow, these one-liners are usually voted down and eventually deleted, and I've been flagging them on SO.

However, I know that we're different from SO and sometimes a single sentence can help a lot. For example, you probably don't need to explain much when you've already pointed out where the Settings item is. Some time ago an NAA was even considered as a partial answer for containing some pieces of information, which https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2436led to a discussion about itself.

So here comes the question: What's our stance for these one-liners and partial answers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's our stance for short and/or partial answers?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I often convert them to comments (as they hold useful/helpful information without being real answers), and leave a comment on the (then deleted) answer explaining the background and encouraging to write up a new, complete answer. Or (when flagged, so I have a reminder) first leave the comment asking to update the answer – and convert it to a comment if there wasn't a reaction within reasonable time. Basically what I said in my answer to the linked question. Also keep in mind that sometimes, one line is all there is to say – so short doesn't necessarily mean NAA or VLQ :)


















As part of implementing the new unified themes across the network, we're gradually rolling out updated site themes for each site. As of today, we have enabled your updated site theme for testing. 

If you can't see it right now, that's by design! This is a very early test implementation of your design and we need your help finding issues with it before we make it live for everyone permanently. So, keep in mind, there will be things that need fixing! We'll address those things as we can.

If you'd like to review it, here's how:

How do I enable it?

https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/users/preferencesClick here and check the "Beta test new themes" option. This will turn on the new theme for all sites that have one in testing, including this one. Here's https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314542/opt-in-to-beta-testing-new-themesmore info on how to opt in. You can uncheck the box to revert to the older theme until the site is live for everyone. Note, while turning it on is immediate, it will take a few minutes to revert to the old view - but it will go through!

What type of feedback do we need?

On this post: Bugs related to this site's design elements

Please help us look for issues/bugs related to the theme design and how we have mapped the old theme to the new. This needs to be done within the https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themeslimits of the new unified theme.

This could include colors of sections of the design or text, problems with JavaScript add-ons (if applicable), the logo or top banner appearance or other artwork.

You can also feel free to ask questions about the new layout if you're unsure how to navigate it.

On Meta Stack Exchange: General concerns about left nav or theming

There are some things that are definitely changing everywhere and can't really be adjusted on a per-site basis. A few of them include:


Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.
Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311237/284336instructions here).
Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the "disable responsiveness" link in the footer.
Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.
Link underlining is active. In an effort to make links more visible, they are now being underlined.


If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav or the overall approach we are taking to theming, then https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsivenessthis Meta Stack Exchange post is the right place for feedback. 

As I mentioned earlier, there are some unique design elements like voting arrows and tags that are being standardized in this process. Keeping these custom elements makes our ability to maintain the sites too complex and, while we're very sad to see them go, we're in a difficult position of needing to make the site designs work together so that we can continue to address feature requests and bugs that will make your Q&A experience better. This is addressed in a https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314799/why-we-initiated-the-latest-round-of-design-changes-and-the-role-of-metaMeta Stack Exchange post if you want more detail.

What new themes?

If you're like, "What the heck are you talking about?", then you should read the Meta Stack Exchange post entitled https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themesRollout of new network site themes (and maybe the posts it links to for the full background). To follow along with the rollout of these new themes, go https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314979/rollout-of-responsive-design-site-themes-tracking-posthere.

Thanks so much for your constructive feedback!

Android has a lot of developers and most of them are enthusiatic. They develop good stuff like Magisk and Xposed but don't care about marketing, and therefore such applications don't have good-looking official websites. This gives scammers chances to build websites "for" those apps and advertise or even spam them, for example https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&body=vancedtube.comhere's some spam records of a fake website for YouTube Vanced. Very unintuitively, the official website for YTV is https://vanced.azurewebsites.net/https://vanced.azurewebsites.net/ (seen on https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-youtube-vanced-edition-t3758757XDA), which doesn't even turn up on the first page of Google result. Similar things also happens for Lucky Patcher (doesn't have its own domain) or Magisk (doesn't have a website at all), etc. Fortunately, apps like Titanium Backup or (previously) SuperSU that are available from Google Play can be easily verified.

Shall we create our list of official websites for those ncie stuff whose websites are often mistaken or surpassed by spammers?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Shall we hold a Community Wiki for all the "official" sites?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Shouldn't those rather be in the corresponding tag wikis? A question like "what are the official URLs" should, according to our rules, be closed as requesting off-site resources ;)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy Ah, yes. Tag wikis sounds like a better place for these.


















Summing up from the comments:

A question asking for "(official) links" would, per definition, be asking for "off-site resources" and thus be off-topic – even if canonical. Best place for such links are the corresponding tag-wikis (if such exist; in the most (important) cases they do – else add them).

And while it's true that tag wikis are ignored much too often (mostly as people are unaware of them), they are not harder to find than any (canonical) question – in fact they are even easier to find whenever the tag is used.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5OK, I'll start suggesting edits to tag wikis to add the links.


















I was looking over the homepage yesterday, and found https://android.stackexchange.com/a/202792/254353this answer by a new user. After looking over it, I noticed that it had content issues.

The answer was:


  Clear "phone manager" app data, it will return limit to "not set" Works on all huawei phones. It works for me


It is a somewhat acceptable answer, but seeing the answer below it changes how it looks. The answer below it (posted almost 3 months ago) is:


  Clear "phone manager" app data, it will return limit to "not set" Works on all huawei phones.


Since it sort-of had an answer in it, I chose to flag it as VLQ instead of NAA (notice how the person who wrote it copied the other answer and just added "It works for me"). 

However, my flag got declined.
https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yts04.png

Why was my flag declined? And can something be done about the answer for the reasons above?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why was my VLQ flag on an answer declined?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The way flags are presented in the queue gives the mods no context that this may have been a copy of an existing answer. Looking at it totally in isolation it looks like a kind of poor answer, but not something that probably merits outright deletion (IMO), and so it was likely declined for that reason. If you see a case like this, where you need to consider other posts to add context, then a custom flag with more details is going to be the best option. I'll let the mod who handled it provide an answer if they'd like to, though.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Just what I wanted to recommend: if context is needed, flag it "in need of moderator intervention". That gives you an input where you can leave an explanation. I've now deleted it (with a hint to the user giving reason).


















I'm writing to you today to let you all know I'll be stepping down from the post of moderator, effective when the (newly announced) election happens. When I first joined this site, it was not just a hobby for me, but a professional interest, as a developer of Android apps and games, and of the OS itself. I hoped to reach out to my own users, and to help bring the deep knowledge of Android to everyone here, to solve the questions that can only be answered as a developer.

But now it's two years since I last worked on Android as a developer, and though I still use an Android phone, I'm not as active on the site as I was, and I don't have that interest to research those hard technical questions. The site's just not the same part of my daily routine that it used to be. We were due for an election anyway, so it seems like the right time for me to step back from moderation duties and encourage some new input from those who are more active on the site now.

I'll still pop in on the review queues occasionally, but I won't be casting the final vote any more. I hope you all continue to encourage asking and answering technical questions when they're of interest to non-developers, as well as the more everyday "I flashed my phone and it won't boot any more" troubleshooting.

Thanks to all those who originally elected me, and I hope you'll remember to vote in the upcoming election. Chatting with moderators on other sites really made me appreciate how friendly and drama-free our community is. We have some good people who I'm sure will become great moderators.

Or rather, the importance of *not flagging until you're sure*.


















Thanks a lot Dan for your work as a Moderator and as a learned and a trusted user of this site. While I find your answers truly insightful and inspiring (one of those answers which actually inspired me to start contributing to this site), I equally appreciate your work as a Moderator. 

I was one of the candidates running up for elections back in 2016, and while I lost and kind of felt bad because I lost to you (a momentary emotion, usual to mortals; and Izzy was sure to win anyway, so I was competing with you mostly :D), I gradually realized that the community chose a much better person as a Moderator than what I could be back than. 

You brought to the table the kind of patience as a Moderator I didn't know  in person. (I think I failed to witness that in other Mods before 2016 was mostly because earlier the Mods were understaffed and under heavy janitorial work load so exercising that much patience might have been detrimental to the site, so they did what they thought was best for the site which I appreciate equally). 

You started salvaging those borderline developer-cum-end-user oriented questions which I et al hastily thought would be closed as off-topic. One of the distinct trait I noted was that you often let the community decide what to do with questions which introduced ambiguity when deciding the scope of the concerned questions.  Furthermore, unless somebody else responded first, you (Izzy too) always remained in site's room, welcomed the visitors as a host and guided them gently.

My personal interaction with you further strengthened my respect for you as a Moderator, especially when I brought to Mods' concern issues which were somewhat unhealthy to the community, and which sometimes I brought with emotions leading to indiscreet engagement. But, you always exercised that basic trait of a Moderator to remain cool, see the facts as it is, and never misuse or abuse the power no matter if it solves the problem in the short run.  

I'm not good with memory so that's what I could recall. That been said, thank you again Dan for helping us fellow users, along with our other hard working Moderators, to focus on that which matters most to us (asking quality questions and answering insightful answers)
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Fully agree and you expressed it better :) and I hope you are planning to contest now

1.


  This is mostly a cache issue. I have also experienced this previously. Please try these out and let me know
  
  
  Download the app and login again. Your issue might be solved
  Use any cache cleaning software
  
  
  If the above doesn't work, try the below ones go to sites like https://thetechnologypost.com/traffic-rider-mod-apk/traffic rider apk
  
  If any of the above doesn't work try waiting for the official new update that will probably solve this issue.



(this answer is edited more than a month ago to add the 3rd and 4th link, the author also has some reputation on Stack Overflow)



  This is most likely a cache issue. I noticed a number of people having this issue after the latest update. Here are a few things I suggest you try:
  
  
  Log out of your gmail account in the app and go into the settings. 
  In the settings, go into the apps section uninstall the app
  Use any clearning app to clean your junk and phone's cache and restart the phone.
  Download the app again, Try to login again. Hopefully, it should work again.
  
  
  If this doesn't work then here's another suggestion to test something. 
  
  
  Go to some Apk sites like https://apkpure.com/apkpure or https://dragongames.co/Dragon city mod and download the older version of the gmail app. Maybe even try https://gamesmodapk.info/subway-surfers-apk/Subway Surfers Apk and https://scoreheroapk.live/Score Hero game
  Try to run it. If the older version works perfectly then there's problem with the latest update for sure. Just wait for the new one

Even if two of the answers contains information and instructions and therefore "looks like" an attempt to answer the question, I do not understand the appearance of links to random Game Mod Apk sites.

To me, all three are spam, so I flagged two of them as spam, and mod-flagged the last one (#2 above).

The fact that these answers exist seems abnormal for such a regular question, anyone knows what's wrong behind this case?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's wrong with this question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Unrelated to the topic, but the OP of 2nd answer [also added spam links on SO on Sep 9 and Sep 27](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/31967641/revisions), looks like the account [became suspicious since Sep 9](https://stackexchange.com/users/2834468/blacklotis?tab=activity). At this point, we could salvage that answer (if we want) by removing the spam links.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. The original revision (i.e. Rev 1) of the 2nd answer also contains the 2nd link (Dragon City Mod Apk is also a fake site, real site [here](http://www.socialpoint.es)). So I think I could have flagged it as spam directly.


















https://android.stackexchange.com/election/5#post-203530iBug's answers to your questions

In case anyone is wondering, my answer to the first question is at the bottom, because I think it's the most important one and should be put at last.


  2. How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?


I'd like to answer this question from two aspects.

First, we value our users. I am also a believer in the saying that "human is born kind". I will try to communicate with the user, via chat or mod messages, to figure out why they're behaving like this, and more importantly whether they know they're being disruptive and can stop. Communication is always the key to success. If the user stops such behavior and continues to contribute valuable answers, then who would object that this is a happy ending?

Second, we have our policies. If the softer approach (talk to them) doesn't work, then unfortunately, we have to hold our ground with the weapons we're equipped with. I will gently ask the user to have a break, and if that doesn't work, manually put them to a break. In my opinion, keeping a site clean, free of abuse and harassment, is more important than having valuable knowledge. To sum up this paragraph, I'd say that the Be Nice policy is NOT optional.

Some extra words: Coming from the same source "human is born kind", I don't think this will ever be a real case, as users who gives valuable answers are highly unlikely to become disruptive. I'm confident that our moderator team can handle it if it really happens.


  3. How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?


First allow me to put the same bold word again: Communication is the key to moderation.

In general, I believe that the other mod who closed/deleted/etc the question has their reasons. Therefore I will talk to them and ask for their reasons. I will try to understand their thoughts and ideas. If we can't form an agreement between us, I'll try to hear from other mods or the community. That's why we have moderator teams and the supporting community so any one moderator don't act like a dictator.


  4. In your opinion, what do moderators do?


Moderators are moderators. They keep the site clean and healthy. As said in https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation, moderators are also the human exception handlers whenever something needs their attention and input.


  5. A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?


I'm fine with that. I am always careful about what I say, while in the meantime trying to maintain a baseline sense of humor. That says, what I've said in the past are what I'll say in the future. I am and will still be proud of them. The primary difference will be in what I do. For example, I will become more careful when doing reviews, closing questions, flagging NAAs, etc, because there will be no more community consensus before those actions take effect.


  6. In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?


This one is another tough question. As brought up many and many times on Android Meta, gaining reputation is particularly difficult here due to the lack of overall activity. This makes it very hard to gain more moderation privileges by reaching higher reputation. Gaining diamond moderator privileges enables me to moderate the site more effectively, by cleaning NAAs, off-topic questions, filling out tag wikis etc, quickly.


  1. As a moderator, how would you address these two issues (if possible) to keep the site more vibrant and active, while freeing your time for more important stuff that only moderators can do?


First I'd like to thank @beeshyams for bringing this question up again. I am the one who asked https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2380/one of the two Meta questions linked in https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2460the proposal of this question, so I can say that I'm a bit prepared for this.

As I have addressed in my question, the real problem behind these two issues is that we aren't effectively turning new users into long-term users. Many users just ask one question or two before turning away.

To start with, I'd like to first state that moderators aren't much different from a regular mid-to-high-rep user, in terms of dealing with this problem. The special privileges that moderators have don't particularly help. Everyone can share their efforts and dedication to helping with this. From the most simple tasks like guiding users through the help center, especially https://android.stackexchange.com/tourthe tour, to advanced ones like improving others' posts by suggesting edits or going through the review queue, none of them are specific to diamond moderators, or the moderator privileges help doing them more effectively or efficiently.

As a moderator, I will try to focus on what moderators can do better than regular users, for example encouraging users to participate in review queues and advocating good behavior, alongside doing those tasks myself. Since this is a community, we need our effort in making the site better and healthier, not just the moderators. I'd also like to thank whoever has helped the site grow, because without you. this site would not have been so great and kept attracting attention from visitors.

Although I knew about the new simplified themes coming up, I was really surprised today to find this site received a blue colored top (instead of the specific Android green) and not even the logo was left green :( 

It really feels like a bug, is there any logic in choosing the blue instead of the original green?

  Houston, we've been having a problem.


From my experience here since early 2017 (or late 2016 - doesn't matter), there are a large portion of users thinking we're a help forum ask asking their specific, highly specialized questions, like "My Android phone had this and it's now behaving like this". These questions are generally hard or impossible to answer without checking the OP's phone, and therefore they're best asked to the aftersale service rather than a public forum. Further more, there are many, many duplicated bad questions just like that, and we can't even close them as duplicates because we don't know what the causes are, and more importantly, whether the same solution applies. While this issue more or less also pertains to Stack Overflow, it's probably not a real issue, as most new users' questions are easily answered if they Google for 5 seconds (fun fact: the new CoC banned comments like LMGTFY). Questions from new users on our site? No. You can Google them? A small data collected at the time of composing this answer: 13149 out of 20975 questions on our site has zero answers - worse than almost every single beta site - and a number of them even have 10k+ views. Meanwhile, A note on this is that XDA is having the same issue, but very way too much significantly less severe than we're having here. This issue has been well-addressed in the 2016 moderator election questionnaire (I just read it all a few days ago).

We are a Stack Exchange site designed for professional or at least civil Q&A, not a help forum. There are too many differences between us and a forum like XDA. We have a relatively strict quality requirement, as designed by SE, and consequently more restrictions for users to participate. For example, one needs 50 reputation to be able to comment on others' posts, making the startup difficult for users wo want to contribute. It is difficlt because the majority (> 80%) of our questions are those personalized, specialized questions, as talked about in the 1st paragraph, which, without asking for further information, are solely impossible to answer. Consequently, we're getting 10+ NAA's on a daily basis, which roughly takes up 1/3 of our daily answers (from all users).

As a result, it's getting harder for new users to be able to participate effectively. In the meantime, there's no way we can stop existing users for quitting. It's a constant process. Existing users, especially high-profile users, often quit for reasons that no one has control over, for example their lives are getting busier, they're moving to their new jobs, etc. Every commmunity faces this, and we're no exception. A community needs a sustainable stream of new blood to keep alive, and that's what we're dying for.

Stack Exchange is a series of websites, whose value depends almost 100% on UGC (user generated content). If we don't have valuable content, we can't attract new users. While we do have some noticeably good questions and answers, the quantity is just too small. Have a look on XDA. They have many posts about Xposed (where rovo89 is a moderator of that section) and modules, Magisk, TWRP, SuperSU (now dead) etc. They have separate sections for those topics, and dedicated sections for developers who want to discuss about developing on those frameworks or announce their projects. Users can ask questions about corresponding projects developed. Users who are familiar with the projects, sometimes developers themselves, answer them. That's a healthy cycle, where problems continue to get solved, and discussions go. We, on the other side, being a Stack Exchange site, have been rejecting open discussions, which is more or less unavoidable.

There's another thing that I'd like to talk about - Android itself. It's year 2018, the era of smartphones. Nokia's Symbian has long died, and Microsoft killed Windows Phone by repeatedly carrying out developer-unfriendly updates. There are only two living industries in the smartphone market - Apple's iOS and Google's Android. iOS is Apple's proprietary software and never runs outside of iPod touches, iPhones and iPads. Apple controls everything about iOS. They're raising the prices so iPhones and iPads are less and less affodable by the lower class. While I dislike the contempt between iOS users and Android users (it's been an old meme in at least China), I can't deny that it's true, even if it's partially. Apple users are generally richer and tend to be more educated (more literate), whereas a huge amount of Android users fall into that "lower class". This is a decisive reason (one of them) that Android forums attract more low-quality than Apple forums. Slighter symptoms are like when they submit online posts as if they were chit-chatting, employing bad English language, and subsequently less readability and overall quality. Heavier symptoms are such people don't know how to Google, or even how to ask. This results in bad questions, usually lacking key details or being plainly uncomprehensive. (Stack Overflow don't really suffer from this, as questions of such class are generally Google-able, and sometimes better yet, closed as duplicate.) We're a greater victim of this, as as it's currently designed, we have little to no way to defend against the stream of LQ questions. This adds another burdening layer to our overall post quality. A lesser problem is that we don't rank high in search engines, as opposed to Stack Overflow or XDA Forum, but I don't know the exact impact on this case.

An immediate conclusion I can draw now, is that in the framework of Stack Exchange's Q&A style, we're unfortunately out of luck. While I'm not any good at community moderation, all the conspicuous solutions that I can suggest for now, are partially or totally against the design of Stack Exchange, and therefore impractical, for example, opening up to open discussions.

Sorry if all the above paragraphs feels depressing, but that's my real thought. I'd like to fill the last paragraph with some practical, possible eases, if not solutions. The first thing is that we can manually add useful content to our knowledge base, by posting self-answered questions. We generate many questions on a day-to-day basis, by playing with Android (not just using Android). While such questions are easily self-solved by an Android Enthusiast, an average person may not easily find out the solution and usually end up asking. If we share. That says, we can "blog" here, in the form of providing useful self-answered Q & As. It'd probably be acceptable and beneficial to enforce Stack Exchange's quality requirement less strictly.

Yes, the situation seems endemic to our site only with only 60-70 users between 2k and 10k reputation points. On top of that, not all of them are active Q&A contributors which aggravates the problem. The situation is so bad I can easily count on my fingers the users who participate on the site regularly and visibly (to others). I also know that we have the https://stackexchange.com/sites#percentansweredsecond lowest percent answered rank network wide. So, I understand the gravity of this situation well enough.

So what I can do as a Moderator to ameliorate this situation?

First, we must grasp the reality that we are not a site oriented strictly to professionals (which makes us different from SuperUser which shares the same motto with us), and that acts as a problem. We are a site oriented towards consumers, who do not care about anything our community needs, expects or wants (and why should they, as we are, too most of them, just an online support). On top of that, the consumer base is incredibly big, something Apple.SE doesn't have to deal with, so despite sharing the same motto, it is we who are different!

Being an enthusiast is a hobby, not a profession . You can be an enthusiast when you are young, in school or college, or have a profession giving you ample time to spend your time on your hobbies. But once life kicks in, enthusiasm fades away or has to give space to more serious things in life. (Movies.SE and Travel.SE are no different from us in this regard.) It happened with me too, when I could barely post 30 answers within a span of 12-13 months, with nearly no other contribution to the site in 2016-17. Even two of our veteran Moderators recently left (one is due soon) because they just couldn't maintain the same level of enthusiasm or perhaps, couldn't find time for it.

We are an anomaly. We have survived and thrived, to an extent, for 8+ years. We have to adapt accordingly, and we may not be able to meet all the criterias other sites in the network do, in terms of overall performance. A mature (in terms of age) generation prefers more signal over noise over time, so they can easily see the benefit in sticking up with this site than the various forums out there, provided they can find time. So we need to actively target new and young blood, provide an atmosphere where they can thrive without deteriorating signal-to-noise ratio beyond a point, contribute here, and possibly, make them understand (action speaks louder than words) the merit of contributing here than elsewhere. 

Some hardcore power users cannot join us such as Magisk (topjohnwu), Xposed (rovo89), GravityBox (CEC0) et al, because they develop things so they need feedback and for that, forums are much suitable. We have to aim for users who stick with former's products because they are often power users too and many of them are willing to find solutions technically and simultaneously help others. They are the same people who sometimes stick up with forums for quite some time, despite the various structural shortcomings in their forums. 

I really do not know why this latter category of users do not come and hang around on this site. Do they not know about us much in general or do they fail to find content useful to keep them here, or do they like a community more on informal side? 

I can't change people's taste. All I can do is help in increasing this site's visibility and improving its content. I have always believed that great, insightful and helpful content drives, attracts and inspires people to help others, as it inspired me to stay here and see merit in this site and the whole network, in general. 

Hence, since my beginning here, I have tried some reasonably doable things, in my capacity as an ordinary user.

First and foremost is the quality control of this site. It is no doubt that Google search often, if not always, links to our site in first few results when searched with Android related issues. I have sometimes made well written (i.e easily comprehensible) answers, even both Q&A, with that thing in mind. I have also heavily flagged, close voted (explicitly, and not much through review queue though), and edited posts. And I could continue to do this because the Moderators did their job well enough despite the workload of this site and their life.

At other times, I have been around subreddit Tasker, whenever time permitted, and linked to a Q/A of our site's  wherever felt appropriate. This part is something our very active users with active presence here and on other forums can do without explicitly making efforts.

On the part of maintaining that user base, I have became somewhat liberal over time in dealing with noise, whether flagging it, or reducing my expectations for upvoting, when I calculated the contribution a user seems to be making, just to help in providing an atmosphere aligned with their taste. 

I really don't have a pompous offering of organising some virtual or real-world event to attract people, because I have been doing  aforesaid things all alone (and I know some users who do it better than me), on my own initiative, to make this site a more better place for me and fellow users who shares the same passion like mine. 

So honestly, I conclude that Moderators don't really have much time, because they are regular users like us with added burden and responsibilities. We can chill out, don't return for long, but they have to think a lot (I believe) to do just that. So there is not much they can do within their free time reserved for this site, especially when they are working professionals and have a family too, except to do their job well enough, efficiently and in time. As long as they clear the mess swiftly, amicably, and maintain good will with others, the burden of the responsibility actually falls over the shoulders of us, the community, together.

https://android.stackexchange.com/election/5#post-203693Firelord answers to your questions:




  
  This is a tough one but to stimulate your thinking to what you can do as a moderator to improve the situation. Our site has about 180 users with reputation in the bracket of 2k to 10k and this number doesn't seem to have changed significantly, at least in the three years I have been a member of this community. I like to think of this section of the community as the White Blood Cells (immunity cells keeping the site clean and healthy by editing questions and answers, casting close & reopen votes, approving tag wiki edits, reviewing and deleting questions) while the moderators are like lungs, liver and kidneys taking care of eliminating more toxic stuff.
  
  But, there are a couple of issues around this: Low strength of this section of community is perhaps endemic to the site as discussed several years ago https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/578/you-need-the-bourgeois-bluesYou need the bourgeois blues. Low activity levels of this section as discussed recently, though focusing only on review aspects (https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2380/how-can-we-spend-some-effort-on-improving-our-overall-activityHow can we spend some effort on improving our over all activity?). A clear indicator of the low involvement is the fact that one rarely sees even a blatantly off-topic question being closed by 5 votes; invariably you find the mod hammer as the deciding vote. As a moderator, how would you address these two issues (if possible) to keep the site more vibrant and active, while freeing your time for more important stuff that only moderators can do?
  


My full explanation can be found https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2469/96277here, so I summarise that Moderators don't really have much time, because they are regular users, like us, with added burden and responsibilities. We are at liberty to stay away from this site, don't return for long, but Moderators have to think a lot (I believe) to do just that, at least I would for being a carrier of so much trust of community. So there is not much the Moderators can do within their free time reserved for this site, especially when they are working professionals and have a family too, except to do their job well enough, efficiently and in time. As long as they clear the mess swiftly, amicably, maintain good will with others, and guide users wherever needed,  the overall burden of the responsibility actually falls over the shoulders of us, the community, together.

Please follow the link if you feel unsatisfied with this response. 


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Network wide Be Nice policy evolved into https://meta.stackexchange.com/conductCode of Conduct for many reasons and primary among them is to remain respectful to others, no matter the degree of their expertise, efforts and behavior, at all times. That said, our site suffers with an adversity of persistent contributors adding valuable answers, so I must consider the community's health vs community's needs. While I would continue to fulfill my duty of handling flags, I would gladly setup a private chat with the user and make attempts to have them follow our Conduct. In addition, if the situation calls for, I would ask a fellow Moderator's assistance to help mould that user's behavior in compliance with our Conduct. However, if the user continues to violate the policy, I would take graded action as sketched out in the policy. 


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Opinions sometime can be misplaced, be it theirs or myself. If a fellow Moderator takes any of the aforesaid actions, I would first reevaluate my own opinion in light of that Moderator's action. The reasoning behind is that another Moderator also carries the trust of the community and stands at equal standing as mine, so it never hurts to undertake a reevaluation when a competent person does something contrary to your position on a matter. If I still continue to hold onto my view, I would privately talk with them and explain my opinion. Hopefully, things would work out well. Unlike what I would do as any ordinary user, I would not take the matter on public chat or meta site because disputes between Moderators themselves, discussed openly, is never good for community, since if we cannot solve our own disputes amicably than for what reason the community would trust us with settling other users' disputes. 


  
  In your opinion, what do moderators do?
  


Primarily, they are exception handlers. They, but not limited to, perform mundane and repetitive tasks which if not performed regularly, frequently and efficiently, can bring to ground the site's quality and community within time. Primarily among them is to handle disputes in the form of flags, reviewing queues just like ordinary fellow users but with additional powers of immediately closing, deleting, reopening, undeleting, merging, migrating et al. 

If not all, at least some of them needs to be easily accessible, so they have to be available in or at least visit a chat room frequently. They have to frequent Meta in order to answer/solve/dispose/ of a matter. 

All of this sounds easy but it comes with one big disadvantage. As the representative of the trust of their community, all of their actions are 
 in-turn decisions, executed immediately, with overriding power sometimes resting with Moderators only, and so, they should take only that decision which they can justify at any point of time in future. Even if they make a mistake, they have to own it when need be.


  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


Barring the stint in my initial days here when I did silly things just like any new user, I have got nothing I need to worry about for what I have done, as I have done everything in good faith, for the benefit of my intellect and the community. I have learned tremendously from this community, and I have been able to contribute to community in the form, behavior and manner it  expects from any other ordinary user. In addition, I believe I can channel more contribution in certain areas, hence, I'm here for your support for me in the elections. 

Furthermore, Moderators are representatives of the community outside the site, be it in chat rooms and meta of other sites network wide, or in the real world, so they have to be careful to a degree and sometimes sophisticated in what they say or do. This would necessarily help me to become more careful, helpful and useful (mostly on network)  when dealing with people outside the community for the benefit of latter.  


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  


I firmly believe in my decisions, and so, compared to privileges limited by reputation points, I would be able to handle posts, with respect to closure and deletion, immediately. I would be able to get rid of "not an answer", custom Moderator attention posts, plagiarism, spam, and what not, immediately and help increase signal-to-noise ratio more which we are always in dire need.

https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/581/44325elderarthis has thoroughly explained the underlying issues in which I fully agree, but as a mod, don't really have a ready solution. This is something that needs community participation to work on, but there is not enough community participation, which is already a vicious circle. Without the community, moderators are as powerless because they don't really have better tools to fix this situation.

As for some ideas... I observed some sites have "weekly topic challenges" (detail on Meta SE: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/240634/how-do-weekly-topic-challenges-workHow do weekly topic challenges work?). The community can propose a topic idea that covers a widely-used/popular app or a hot topic based on recent news. With current community participation, we can extend from weekly to monthly. Hopefully, this can attract more participation and make the site more active.

In addition to that, I think some sites have a "bounty week", in which a meta post is opened to nominate posts that are extraordinary and deserve the bounty. Hopefully, this can help to bridge the reputation gap that is needed for the community to moderate more effectively and also encourage users to contribute more quality posts at the same time.

One thing that I also want to focus on is the large number of "troubleshoot my device plz" questions. They take time to be triaged (is it unclear? is it a duplicate?) and it also affects the impression of this site on future potential answerers, that this site is just "another boring troubleshooting forum" (personally, that's one factor I reduced my activity since back then).

The reason I bring that issue specifically is because of "moderation fatigue". Not only moderators, but regular users are also exposed to this. When they are too often reviewing bad posts, they might get tired and give up the review queue (could be worse because they don't have a binding vote and feel powerless, which is the reason I stated in my nomination). 

Unlike diamond mods, moderation by regular users is certainly a voluntary action. If we can reduce the source of moderation fatigue, hopefully it will increase the community's enthusiasm in reviewing once more. However, this might need multiple iterations which is better to be discussed on another meta post in the future (e.g. rescoping? specific close-reason banner? guideline in meta?).

In my humble opinion, a site with only 10 regular active reviewers is already enough to maintain the site. In the end, moderators can only facilitate the feature, they need the community to work together in improving this situation.


  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


Knowledge is extremely valuable, but after all, we are all human beings and have some ego.

Recently, there's a change in "Be Nice" policy to a more extensive https://android.stackexchange.com/conduct"Code of Conduct" which applies to everyone, and also I believe is a good guideline for moderators to follow.

However, considering the current situation, we desperately need users who are knowledgeable and can self-moderate, and a large number of arguments/flags will just worsen the situation. I believe the best approach is to guide and make them understand what are the acceptable practices without a need to be aggressive/confrontational, so they can lead others by example too.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


First, try to know their reasoning privately and politely, and then try to work on the solution constructively. If no consensus is reached, ask for other mods' input to prevent conflict of interest. At this point, I really hope the issue can be resolved without requiring the community input, but if the consensus is still not yet reached, then...

Next, just like regular users, open a meta discussion on child-meta to discuss the issue only (no need to call out if it's by a mod, etc.). There's a possibility that input from the community may give a different and better insight than just of the moderators. Take their input into consideration to make a better decision. **Different opinions can't be avoided, but **

In the end, I believe in open, transparent, and civil discourse for the better of the community. The reason I'm okay with letting the community input is that most of the moderation actions are already public (anyone can access the /timeline or /revision of a post). It can look more suspicious to the community when there are contradicting actions done by different mods without any discussion at all.


  
  In your opinion, what do moderators do?
  


Borrowing the terms from https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/299969/2014-so-moderator-election-qa-questionnairethe 9th question of 2014 Stack Overflow election, moderators are considered as "janitors" and "exception handlers". They are janitors, in which they have more powerful tools to clean-up the site, but they are also exception handlers when there are disputes between the members.

The balance between being a janitor or an exception handler might be different on this site while it lacks active reviewers, but ideally in a situation where reviewers are plenty, they should mainly be an exception handler.

They are also the "leaders", not the "bosses" (further reading: https://www.volarisgroup.com/blog/article/the-difference-between-a-boss-and-a-leaderThe Difference Between a Boss and a Leader). They lead the community by example and care for the overall result, not only thinking about their own goals.


  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


I have no problem with that.

While I did have a period where I was brash in commenting for moderation (moderation fatigue is real when you're so obsessed with it), the past is the past, and I always strive to become a better person (I learned so much, changed, and improved my approach on moderation while participating on Anime.SE). If else, the diamond will always remind me to become more humble.

As for perceiving by other users, I personally don't see my "diamond indicator" (if elected) as a special status, because in the end, mods are also parts of the bigger community. With or without the diamond, everyone (including me, nonetheless) should strive to build a conducive community.


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  


One of the biggest impacts is comment moderation, something that even high-rep users cannot do until now (and https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/252691one of the popular but controversial feature requests on Meta Stack Exchange). I have to admit, I'm in the "no unnecessary comments" group because I love to see clean posts, and will possibly clean-up comment thread if it has served its purpose. (I have raised many useful flags on Anime.SE to clean-up comment threads)

Second is... the binding vote. While this should not be the answer, the current dire situation that has been stated on the question (1) makes this feature more effective, though I really hope we can improve the situation if possible ("treat the cause, not the symptom").

However, all of these won't be effective without the support of underlying community. (There were some SE beta sites that got closed because they were not moderated for a long time. While Android.SE is already graduated and won't be closed, we certainly don't want to be that site)

I thank the community for trusting me with this privilege. I deeply respect that, and I would, to the extent possible and permissible, attempt to ensure that my actions as a Moderator contribute to the betterment of our community.

I'm, however, shocked to find three Moderators leaving their diamond privilege in a row. They are some of the most valuable veteran users we have. I've personally learned a lot from them, from their actions as a Moderator and equally from their inspiring high-quality answers. 

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for serving this community as Moderators in keeping the site tidy and neat to the extent they could, and more so in its troubled times. I hope that they would continue to stay with us, visit us whenever they could, and contribute here with their expertise which we genuinely crave for. :-)

There's a lot of moderation that happens behind the scenes and is not visible to other users.


















A sincere thanks to the community for reposing your trust and confidence in me to be a moderator.

Dan leaving us was known since he communicated his reasoning on Meta. It was an unpleasant surprise but  I fully respect his decisions. 

Matthew leaving is a shocker coming out of the blue. At a personal level, I wouldn't have been an active member of this community without him guiding me out of (self created) mess.

As they say of Veterans Old soldiers never die, they fade away ; leaving behind their imprints and inspiring us to do better.

I wish both  veterans, the best and hope that they do not go off the radar and continue to help the community.

I recently  edited the question "https://android.stackexchange.com/q/204013/96277How to know what is causing a weird lock screen with ads to show up?" and realized that this might be closed as a duplicate of "https://android.stackexchange.com/q/143330/96277What is this lock screen with ads and how do I remove it?". 
The latter question has many answers with extensive list of apps exhibiting the problem (another lock screen with ads). 

For some reason, the apps in those lists didn't (as I presumed) work as none of the apps were installed in asker's phone. It turned out to be an another app, a game specifically. 

The latter question, unfortunately, doesn't have any answer which helps in identifying apps through troubleshooting. The answers are merely acting as a repository of known apps exhibiting such problems. I tried to solve this problem by https://android.stackexchange.com/q/145451/96277inviting technical answers, but to no avail.

So, should close voters and Moderators vote to close those former questions as a duplicate to the latter, or is there a better solution available? 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should "lock screen with ads" questions be marked as a duplicate to a single one?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What about merging?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@iBug yeah, that's one choice available, although the latter question would have to be edited to accommodate the merged answers, otherwise,  an unsuspecting user could argue how the merged answer addresses the latter question (the one with most answers).


















First thing that comes to mind is the nature of answers that fit such questions. In the absence of any technical solution  (which OP had asked), it has to be a repository of known apps that cause this nuisance.
Secondly, this repository has to be a living repository , given that there would be a steady supply of new apps that would cause this lock screen behaviour.
In our framework , Community Wiki (CW) is a viable solution meeting these needs. https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/11740What are "Community Wiki" posts? from mother meta is a useful reference. Here is what I propose:

Consolidate existing questions (two at the moment) by merging.

Convert the merged question into a CW (question and all answers will become CW posts).https://android.stackexchange.com/q/143330What is this lock screen with ads and how do I remove it? will be the foundation of CW.

There are comments in the main answer that list additional apps. These could be added as a CW answer to make the list comprehensive.

This CW becomes a canonical question for duplicate closure in future. In case OP (in future) finds their question marked as duplicate but they don't have any listed apps installed, it is not treated as duplicate (as is done for any other question, when existing solutions don't work).

In case, a technical solution emerges in future, that would also be included in the CW.


But wait and think
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/143330What is this lock screen with ads and how do I remove it? is a very popular question with about 250k views, with  60 votes on the question and the highest rated answer having 64 votes (It has 13 answers). It is unique in that sense and while I haven't verifed, it is easily the top voted (questions and answers put together) in the last two years.
By converting this to CW , none of the contributors lose reputation gained from it. Quoting from CW post of meta


The original author still gets badges based on community posts.

The original author keeps the reputation gained (or lost) before their post entered community mode.



But they will not gain/lose reputation in future, once it is made a CW
This could be a valid concern for the contributors. Unless, we have a community consensus on this it may cause resentment and one needs to be very deliberate about this.
So up vote if you agree and down vote if you don't.

There could be objections to this as pointed out in comments by OP, but one can point to this meta discussion to explain the rationale.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have also posted an answer on that proposed CW but am OK with not getting rep in future so +1 from my side :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just noticed that Benjamin (author of most voted answer) wrote this in a [comment](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/143330/what-is-this-lock-screen-with-ads-and-how-do-i-remove-it#comment184939_143373_): *..If you or anyone else finds more feel free to edit them in or (if it makes sense) make this a community-wiki..*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Benjamin's answer has a very short list compared to bmdixon's. He also has gotten 60+ votes already and is fine with it if the answer is turned into a CW. OTOH, we have bmdixon's extensive list with commentators sometime suggesting an app to be added to it too. I  think if it has to be done, his can be converted to CW, and Benjamin's unfortunately has to be deleted. It could be otherwise, if bmdixon  prefers.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Yes. bmdixons list is bigger and therefore better. But it doesn't really matter because in the end all are going to be merged into a single answer. But having the buy in of at least top few answerers helpsb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5+1 from me. My answer was initially based on a list from elsewhere but has been added to over time so I can't take all of the credit anyway. I'm happy for this to be converted into a CW.


















Today I flagged a question as off-topic for asking about an app that can do a specific task. I later checked back and saw that the question had been edited to ask the same question in a different way without asking about an app so I figured I would check my flags, but it was still pending. Later on, it was declined, I assume because the flag no longer matched what the question was.

My questions being: When and how are flagged questions and answers checked in relations to edits? Are pending off-topic flags always declined when a question or answer is edited and are no longer valid? and What can I do in the future to avoid flagging an off-topic question or answer that could potentially be declined?

This is useful for new mods like me to exercise diligence. Please don't let this flag discourage you!


















S9 and S9+ differ in certain specs such as display, battery, RAM, storage, camera et al. S9+ seems to have them larger in size. But telephoto camera stands out distinctively. 

Taking into consideration that with the passage of time non-expandable RAM becomes a hindrance in performance (such as a smooth UI, app response, multitasking)  we might start getting questions regarding performance about S9, but not necessarily for S9 plus. Similarly, people may get into issues with Camera app on S9 plus or something related with it which would be altogether irrelevant for S9 users. 

However, there can be issues with both phones which could be tackled in the same fashion, such as, a solution for customizing Bixby button could work the same way for S9+ too. In that case, should we be closing as a duplicate or leave them be?

That said, I still recommend using separate tags for now.

First, a minor point, request, and bug:


  Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been moved to chat. – Firelord♦ 6 hours ago


But it was I who moved it to chat. It seems it was then moved again, within chat by the mod. I think the latter should be undone if it can be. Yes?



Obviously, I was "in disagreement of a moderator's actions." I questioned their initial actions and explained why they were obviously inappropriate, IMO. I appreciate Fire's acknowledgement that they were, so let's move on. Other than that, the mod is (implicitly) declining to address my concerns or repeated requests for clarification. I hereby ask 'Em again, now.   ...   The mod is now telling me what I think. That also feels a bit aggressive and inappropriate.


  You willingly added [A] to show your discontent with my moderation knowing fully [B].


No.  I don't think any of that.  


  I have locked this post until the dispute is resolved on meta or you decide to disengage on your own.


Seems unhelpful and rude.  Especially when I have proposed an alternative and was given no feedback on it. I wonder what is and isn't meant by disengage in that context.


  Furthermore, please avoid excessive comments.


What are you talking about?  There isn't a single comment by me on the Q OR A. Maybe that comment was meant for the kind participant?


  If you intend to talk to me regarding unlocking it, you can use a chat room.


I had already done that.


  Do note that your successive revisions made your question clear, so I did reopen it, but had to lock it due to system's misuse. – Firelord♦ 6 hours ago


If that made my question clear, the current question could have been replaced with that clear question. However I would suggest checking in with me as to whether you indeed have my question clear before editing it, based on track record.  And I would appreciate an assumption of good faith going forward. Is that too much to ask for?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Disaggreement with moderator locking my questionb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do the normal policies on being agreeable or what is and isn't appropriate question editing apply at all to moderators?  Common Sense would dictate that most do or should. Ones that are being violated.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"There isn't a single comment by me on the Q OR A." Not a single one that isn't deleted, no. I count 9 (deleted) comments by you. And seeing the edit history (especiall edits 4 and 5), I'd say it's you who needs to learn behavior. What you edited into your question definitely doesn't belong there (but rather could have been asked in chat or on Meta). The edits Firelord has done were absolutely reasonable (I had done the same). To me it looks it's you who'se unreasonable – especially when coming with false arguments ("not a single comment").b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Your chat invite reached me and I wanted to respond later after studying the question, by which time I saw that appropriate action had been taken by Firelord. I don't think you invited Firelord, which you should have considering that you have issues with his actions (not saying inviting another moderator is wrong, but excluding Firelord?)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And beeshyams, you're mistaken in that I DID invite that person that you accuse me of 'excluding'. That's on the record. Can you please address that? I recall attempting to do so directly, and then seeing that he was gone (or hidden? Would any such activity be permanently logged?), AND I specifically asked him: "Are you really opposed to a general question of this nature to which a useful general answer can be provided?" A question which he's ignored.  It feels like he's ignored most if not every one of my questions.  Behavior which, I note, is deemed "absolutely reasonable" 'round here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Izzy, did you not read that "it was I who moved [the comments] to chat'?  Do you not believe me?  If you do, then why do you claim that "There isn't a single comment by me on the Q OR A." is a false argument?

By the time you told me that the comments belonged in a chat or on meta,  the evidence was already available in multiple places related to the question that showed that knew that. If you didn't realize I knew by then, can you ack that your reading comprehension has some room for improvement? Can you, Andrew?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5It's consequential - y'all not joining me in chat, not engaging in discussion, making excuses for not discussing that person's actions.


















I can't discuss this in isolation as this would further the controversy. I need to consider your first revision and sketch out the issues here with that and further revisions.
https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/205832/1Here's revision 1:

Title: How do I disinfect my infected Android device (phone) with adware malware that simple steps failed to remove? And what should I AVOID trying?

WAIT! Before you reflexively down vote this, see my answer!
In the process of trying to resolve the infection, I kept hitting major, dangerous hurdles. I had a pretty good guess as to what had led to the infection, but hit hurdle after hurdle as I tried to act accordingly.
I was surprised that the simple steps I tried didn't work. But then, I'm used to the iOS environment, which is much better defended.

That revision had multiple issues to begin with.

Title says you tried some steps but failed to mention the steps you followed.

Title also says "what should I avoid trying?". We need to know what you already tried which you didn't mention. Besides, that is something which is actually very broad. Since the body didn't focus on that, I reduced the scope of the question by editing it out (to prevent it from yet another closure (too broad).

The two paragraphs "In the process...defended" (almost the whole of the body) were of no use to a user trying to understand your problem because of the missing steps.
(Tip: always write a question as if somebody else is having that issue and you want to solve it, so you'd always try to mention what's relevant to understand the question at first go. May be some clarification could still be needed, but the question should at least stand on its own without clarification.)


As for considering the answer as asked in the body,  it must be noted that a question, no matter whether one intends to answer it or wants it to be answered, must stand on its own ground. (We have some exceptions to this with self-answering, especially when the user intends to provide a conceptual understanding of a subject matter and a rooting guide et al.) Requiring a person to go through a answer just to understand the question disrupts the Q&A format and reduces it to forum style posts. It also wastes a reviewer's/moderator's time and effort that could well have been spent on matters genuinely requiring urgent attention.
Self-answered questions can be presented standalone. I have done so, and you can evaluate them yourselves.

https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/123374/90094How to disable sticky search bar in Google search portal?

https://android.stackexchange.com/q/143247/96277How to make Google Play services and other default white-listed system apps Doze?
https://android.stackexchange.com/q/132927/96277Using command-line to boot into primary and secondary ROM of MultiROM (I have two self-answers for this)

As for the closure, a flag was raised against your question for being unclear. Because it was unclear to me as well, I closed it. Closure doesn't mean the post is done for. The closure note broadly indicates that the post should be fixed, and a fixed post may deserve to be reopened. Normally, a moderator leaves a note when closing a post as "unclear" because the user cannot usually come to know what to fix in it. However, user Irfan Latif had already asked most pertinent information in a comment, so I avoided adding my own comment. I suppose I should have been more careful by being explicit with what's wrong with the post.
I had to resort to locking your post because the meta issues of the question and your objection to a moderator's action should be addressed on the meta site. Knowingly not using the meta site but the post itself for addressing meta grievances can be considered abuse, as I considered in this case.
To be clear that I have nothing personal against the post or you per se, I did reopen the post after your https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/205832/4revision 4 added useful information but simultaneously locked it for aforesaid reason.
I appreciate your intent to help us out by sharing your knowledge, but it has to be done in an order and format that the community expect. A deviation requires an appropriate response. It started with closure, which when failed to control things, led the locking of the post.
As for this meta question, some parts do not require answering because I have discussed the original question in detail. As for the comments, Irfan and you engaged in a very long discussion. Comments are for clarifications and suggestions. If there are 20+ comments (including both sides) then either the involved users are too chatty or something in the post requires an immediate fix, barring some exceptions.
Yes, you did offer a chat room in comments which was a good step on your part. When fixing your question, I simply moved all the comments into a chat room (auto-generated) and deleted them to avoid redundancy. If you think there exists a bug, please report it separately from your immediate issue here.
Also, it is neither Firestarter, nor Fire. It is Firelord (no spaces, no surname). I request you to focus on the matter from next time, not on distorting the name of a person (even if it is just an avatar). And please use standard dedicated channel for grievance redressal, which is meta here.

Each subsequent revision only made it worse in the process attracting additional down votes (since it gets bumped to home page and more viewers evaluate it). While the answer did not attract any down votes ; this should objectively indicate that the problem is with the question.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I just want to emphasize that whatever the case, meta-commentary (especially related to downvoting/close voting, unless it's about defending against duplicate) is never appropriate on the post, or even on the comment. It's just a noise that casual readers won't care, and SE regulars will instead tend to downvote the post because usually it indicates the post is lacking. Let's focus on the content, not the user's action.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Thanks. I have attempted a fix. Please see if there is something that is focusing not on the content but on user, barring last para.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Content? Please, Lord, do focus on it. Address my STILL outstanding CONTENT Q! The whole point of my Q is to provide a general A to a general Q, not specifics for my phone and the particular malware that's on it. I.E.: "Q:In general what steps are appropriate to disinfect an infected Android device (phone, tablet, etc) with adware malware that simple steps (Attempt to identify, Force Stop and uninstall any apps that it could have come in.) failed to remove? And what should one AVOID trying?"
If you're opposed to that too, WHY? A general Q of this nature with a useful, general A? Really? FS!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(And if you aren't opposed, allow me to to edit my Q.  (Which is short for Question; A is for Answer. [sigh])


















My question may seem like a duplicate to https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2205/96277How shall we deal with outdated answers no longer valid? but I'm here seeking consensus for a specific category of answers only, the ones which which feature an app's link and relies on them to be useful for a user. Consider this answer which I recently encountered:

The "Graffiti" writing technology from the old PalmOS devices is available for Android now, and supports letter at a time text input with a stylus (or presumably a finger). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.access_company.graffitiGraffiti for Android.
However, something like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diotek.ime.diopenDioPen or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.input.PenReaderStandardPenReader seems to be more what you're after. They both have very mixed reviews, and do seem to be better on some devices than others, and take some getting used to.

All the links to Play Store are dead. The answer, as of now, is of no use. Given the consensus which emerged https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2206/96277here I have so far deleted such answers leaving a one line justification and a link to the consensus for further reading.
However, I lately realized that information about an app which is unavailable in Play Store can still be found on AppBrain. For example, https://www.appbrain.com/app/com.access_company.graffitihere is the Graffiti for Android. AppBrain doesn't provide a link to such apps, but shows adequate information for a user to locate that app on web. It provides the package name in the URL, developer's name, size of the app, and the changelog showing when the app was unpublished et al.
While I am in complete agreement of the linked consensus, I want to ask if replacing Play Store's dead app links with AppBrain's is worth the effort? Of course, I'm asking this as a secondary approach, in case one is hesitant to take down or flag an answer.
One problem I could think of is for how long this feature of AppBrain would be available for dead Play Store apps? If they remove this feature, our replace links would turn dead. Perhaps knowing since how long this feature has been available could bring some confidence.
To be precise, this approach is proposed to be optional for everyone. If you think it is worth to save the answer and you've got the time, then only edit the links. Else, do flag for deletion.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should app dependent answers with dead links be replaced with AppBrain's links?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What's more, Appbrain even links to alternatives (not always successfully, but it does). Which is one of the reasons I wrote a [UserScript that replaces all Playstore links by Appbrain links](https://greasyfork.org/de/scripts/27695-android-applinks-rewriter) :)


















I wouldn't bother. If you can use AppBrain's information to find a legal download for the app, then replace the link with a download link. (For example, apps which have been removed from Google Play but still available through F-Droid or the publisher's site.) If you can't legally download and use the app any more, then information about the app doesn't help you solve the original problem, so I'd remove the answer in that case, to protect the answer from being downvoted.

Of course, if the answer contains other information that's useful apart from the app link, then an edit would be more appropriate. For example, "You can solve the problem with these steps, or download this app to do it for you."

As long as we are not suggesting that illegal or unethical means be used, should it not be left for the user to decide from where to obtain the APK? My proposal of using AppBrain links is to leave a door open for some users who might be willing to search an app, no matter where it is hosted. It is just that this comes at a cost of majority visitors who won't be able to use the AppBrain information for anything. I'm looking for a justifiable tradeoff here.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I agree, we shouldn't be concerned by what visitors do outside our site, I just don't want to be giving users red-herring links: "You can solve your problem with this app. You can find out all about the app on *appbrain link* but you have to find the app yourself because it's banned/unmaintained"b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For "wouldn't bother", it's a quite detailed answer – and I agree with everything except the first sentence #D Or well, maybe rewrite it to "I wouldn't bother *actively searching for such content"?* But when "accidentally stumbling upon", it would be a good action.


















1.5 months after the election, https://android.stackexchange.com/users/131553/beeshyamsbeeshyams no longer has a diamond.

The site now has fewer mods than before the election.

It hasn't been long since this community's https://android.stackexchange.com/election/5most recent election, barely more than 2 months ago. However, for personal reasons, moderator elect beeshyams has had to step down from the position. Though their service time was short, we would like to thank them for the work they contributed in this time. 

Normally due to the proximity to a prior election, we would look at whether we can pull a runner up from the election to take place. However, as the runner up is the only un-elected candidate who participated in the election, it would be victory by default instead of by voting in that scenario.

After consultation with the current moderator team, it's been deemed necessary that we fill the absence in the team sooner rather than later, so a new election is being prepared to begin collecting questions on January 28th, 2019. 

Since this is sudden and so soon after the most recent election, we've opted to make an announcement about this plan well in advance. This is not only to help inform people of the upcoming election so that they may prepare their platforms as candidates, but also to help determine the number of slots. The moderators are suggesting we fill in 2 slots - however, for an election to run we require at least N+1 candidates for an N slot election. More is ideal, but at minimum we must ensure that there is enough candidates for there to actually be a meaningful vote by the community to indicate who they support for the role. Since the prior election had a low turnout, though, we're holding this thread to do a bit of an interest check. 

This is not an official nomination thread, but it serves both as a means for users to indicate that they'd be interested in the position, or potentially name other users who they believe may be suitable to the role (assuming that said users agree to run). Based on feedback on this thread, we may adjust the slot count for the election once the question collection phase begins.

Do you mean you were suspended within last year?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5This got slipped by, but I wasn't planning to require interest expressed as answers. I wouldn't object to answers being posted but unlike on Data Science's part, this site doesn't have quite as dire a turnout to the elections of late and we're holding the election definitively. So that's why I didn't put in a clause for big posty standing-up.


















I disagree that answers containing dead links to Play/Whatever Store are useless or should be deleted. There are usually plenty of places where you can find apks, so answer with dead links at least tells that some app exists. I think you should undelete such answers.
Maybe only answers containing links to apps which require some kind of web service which is down forever e.g. clients for dead social network should be deleted.
Looks like all apps from your example only changed names and package names and are still available on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.access_company.graffiti_pro&hl=enGraffiti for Android, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diotek.diopen.script&hl=enDioPen, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.input.PenReaderInAppPenReader. Anyway old apk versions are also available from first pages of google search (of course user should be careful with these) or e.g. from 4pda.ru.
As for AppBrain I don't really like it because of this:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/nFqYq.png
Got it after ~5 pageviews.
I'd prefer links to WebArchive instead (or maybe to both of them).

In connection with the moderator elections, we are holding a Q&A thread for the candidates. Questions collected https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2515/2019-moderator-election-qa-question-collectionfrom an earlier thread have been compiled into this one, which shall now serve as the space for the candidates to provide their answers. 

Due to the lack of submissions, the Q&A will comprise of our default questions for a total of 5 questions.

As a candidate, your job is simple - post an answer to this question, citing each of the questions and then post your answer to each question given in that same answer. For your convenience, I will include all of the questions in quote format with a break in between each, suitable for you to insert your answers. Just https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/2cde7727-db6d-481e-8c0b-974d82723477/view-sourcecopy the whole thing after the first set of three dashes.Please consider putting your name at the top of your post so that readers will know who you are before they finish reading everything you have written, and also including a link to your answer on your nomination post.

Once all the answers have been compiled, this will serve as a transcript for voters to view the thoughts of their candidates, and will be appropriately linked in the Election page.

Good luck to all of the candidates!

Oh, and when you've completed your answer, please provide a link to it after this blurb here, before that set of three dashes. Please leave the list of links in the order of submission.

https://android.stackexchange.com/election/6?tab=nomination#post-207412Andrew T.'s answers to your questions

Also, https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2477/44325my answer to the 2018's election; 3 months ago




  
  How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?
  


In general, I will be quite direct in following and enforcing the https://android.stackexchange.com/conductCode of Conduct: warning, account suspension, and account expulsion.

However, at this moment, Android.SE is lacking experts. Making them left the site because of arguments/flags is the very last action I want to take. With help of other moderators, I'll try best to make a compromise and persuade them to improve their behavior while still reducing/preventing the friction within the community.


  
  How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?
  


Discuss with them casually but politely, just like how I will do even as a regular user. Our moderators are very rational and open-minded, and I believe we can give feedback to each other constructively without being intimidated. If it is just a single instance of disagreement, then I can live with it ;)

However, if it becomes a pattern, I will request the moderator to discuss the cause of the issue ("focus on the content, not the user") on the meta with the community, just like how regular users can and should do. 


  
  In your opinion, what do moderators do?
  


Borrowing the terms since then, moderators are "super janitors" and "exception handlers"; "super janitors" because they are basically unrestricted in cleaning up the sites, and "exception handlers" for issues that regular users cannot handle by themselves.

While in general moderators should be the "exception handlers" and let the community moderating the site, Android.SE has multiple problems that prevent the community from doing their moderation effectively. This is where moderators can support them by being the "janitors".


  
  A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?
  


Personally, I will not feel scared/shameful/discouraged. The past is the past, it cannot be changed, but let the prior bad experiences be a lesson for improving in the future, both as a regular user and especially a moderator.


  
  In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?
  



Binding votes: reduce the time needed for the effect to be applied and prevent wasting the regulars' votes on the same post.
Comment moderation: regular users cannot do it effectively.

https://android.stackexchange.com/election/6#post-207421Xavier's answers to your questions


How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?


I will stick to the regular protocol here; Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time (through Account Suspension). After that, have nothing to do with them (Account Expulsion) But as stated already in the Code of Conduct, most issues are resolved after the first warning.
Let me be a bit clear here- A warm and friendly community will always take a higher priority over a "stream of valuable answers". Bad/unfriendly behaviour tends to drive away new users to the site, besides there are always other people who can answer questions.


How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?


Talk to the mod nicely perhaps in chat, It could have been a mistake - after all we are all humans, perhaps worth noting- "nothing is so simple that it cannot be misunderstood" a thing one person may overlook may be a serious case to someone, and this can be resolved through the art of communication.


In your opinion, what do moderators do?


A moderator is a servant. These guys have to toughest job in the community, they lead by example which makes them good servants. They check for untoward behaviour among users, constantly check for content quality and help decide what is suitable/unsuitable for the community.


A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?


Knowing I have committed myself to being a good servant of the community, makes me feel great, and will remind me I have a big role to play on the site and should always lead by example and maintaining a kind and friendly environment.


In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?


As a mod, there is active engagement, A 10k/20k user may decide to commit less time to active moderating duties, but as a mod you constantly have to 'be in the game' to make sure there is sanity in the community.

I edited https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/207842/rooting-panasonic-eluga-pulse-x-phonethis question by changing the title and it was https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/211709rejected (I kept the body unchanged due to past experience with editing). I wanted to add a tag related to the phone but it didn't exist. It was later on edited and approved (I am fine with the edits made by Andrew T.). 

When I started with editing posts, there used to be many of them rejected because I only changed https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/208930capital letters or corrected a few grammatical errors or https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/208880formatting that were not considered not good enough. I learned from them thanks to a moderator who told me what I can and should not do to make my edits better. Although I have carried on with editing posts, I refrain myself of others (usually when checking first post, I just click Skip even when I see there are possibilities to edit a post). But when a moderator or high reputations users modify the posts, even when their changes are not that different from what a user with a low reputation would have made, they are approved (sorry, I am too lazy to find many examples; I will only mention the link above as example).

There is a question in StackExchange that deal with whether "Thanks", "Thank you" and such, should be kept or removed (edited out) on questions. There were some users who said that they should be kept, yet it was removed from the original https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/207842/revisionspost. There are other edits on the aforementioned post that are also correcting capital letters, punctuation, etc; and yet it was approved (I have made other similar changes to post like the one described on the previous sentence and they were approved).

Why are they (the edits from moderators and high reputation users) consider better? How does the edits that would have been rejected when made by a new user or user with a low reputation be accepted when moderators and high reputation users?

Note: I am not sure if I should consider myself lower or higher reputation.

Fun fact: I learned today that Community is able to reject edit.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What makes edits by moderators and users with high reputation better than edits from lower reputation usersb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5You can find a list of all of your rejected edits [here](https://data.stackexchange.com/android/query/45755/my-rejected-edits) (courtesy of [Idolon](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/104579/286110)).

Thanks to @Idolon for creating the query.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5On an unrelated topic - I've been skipping all your edits concerning image resizing because almost all images you resized end up looking squashed (i.e. incorrect aspect ratio). I believe it's enough to simply limit one dimension of the image and the other will automatically be calculated at the correct aspect ratio. Please take this into consideration next time.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndyYan I try to re-dimension them to be 320*480 or 360*480. Are there better resolution I should choose? Don't avoid them, your input in what is wrong, and how I can make improvements is welcome.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5And that's where the problem lies - most screenshots are of 16:9 ratio or even longer. As I said, just limit one of the dimensions and the other should auto-fit, e.g. ``b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndyYan They don't seem to be 16:9, maybe because I don't click on them to view the real size. When they appeared on my browser, the size seems to be 640*800 (nearly always). I'll try to limit only either the width or height. Can you link to an example where only one of the dimension was changed?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In [this suggested edit](https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/212511) for example, the original size of the picture is 540x960 - 16:9 ratio. Something's up with your browser I guess. // [This answer of mine](https://android.stackexchange.com/a/179226/150986) includes a picture limited to width 300. IIRC I learnt the trick from AndrewT some time ago.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndyYan Thanks, then I will learn from you :-)  I just notice now because you mentioned AndrewT that you were him ;-)


















I'd like to start this by explaining why I rejected that edit.
I rejected (and edited) that https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/211709suggestion1 after I have approved (and edited) 3 suggested edits by you consecutively: https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/2116391, https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/2117112, https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/2117163:

https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/2116391st suggested edit: image resizing is mostly welcomed (due to the current notorious buggy Imgur's image scaling), though the title shortening and the addition of Android version tag were questionable. The suggested title would make the question too general, and there's no indicator that this was specific to Android 8.1. However, I decided to err on the side of caution and approved the suggestion as good intention, then https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/197239/revisionsclarified the title, removed the tag, and added a more relevant tag.

https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/2117112nd suggested edit: the suggestion added paragraphs to make it more readable, fixed some capitalization, and clarified the steps. Though there were some missed capitalizations ("chrome" on the first paragraph) and typo on the name of the app ("Pintrest"), the overall suggestion was good and hence my approval. I also took a liberty to https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/207862/revisionsfix the rest & remove fluff that I feel didn't add anything to the answer

https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/2117163rd suggested edit: fixing code formatting properly is welcomed, though I wondered why you didn't fix all capitalizations and punctuation in the beginning. I decided to approve for the code formatting and https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/207837/revisionsedited the rest.

https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/2117094th suggested edit (1 the review preview is misleading because only the title was changed, compare to the https://android.stackexchange.com/revisions/207842/1original revision instead): the suggestion only fixed the title. Ignoring the fact that the editor couldn't create a new tag (which is understandable), while the title fix was an improvement, I couldn't ignore the rest that none of the capitalizations ("android", "i") and the spacing after punctuation were fixed. At this point, I decided to reject and https://android.stackexchange.com/posts/207842/revisionsfix all obvious issues. The fluff removal was my personal judgment. Had the suggestion fixed all the obvious issues even without removing fluff, I'd approve it.


I understand your good intention on improving this community by suggesting edits, and I really appreciate it! However, the https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edithelp center on 'edit' privilege (2000 reps) mentions this

Tiny, trivial edits are discouraged - try to make the post significantly better when you edit, correcting all problems that you observe.
(italic emphasized mine)

The first 3 suggestions were certainly improvements to me, and that's why I approved them. However, the last one... fell short to me, and hence my decision to reject it.
Now, please don't be discouraged due to that rejection, keep up on suggesting edits! But I'd like to also take this as an opportunity to let you know about this and edit more carefully from now, and we'll have a win-win situation :)

Now, for the rest of the meta question

When I started with editing posts, there used to be many of them rejected because I only changed https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/208930capital letters or corrected a few grammatical errors or https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/208880formatting that were not considered not good enough.

Personally, if I faced the "capital letters" review independently, I might have approved it (though I could also see the edit as too minor). However, it might be a similar case to this when you suggested many consecutive edits with some questionable quality and made the reviewers wary about the edits.
The "formatting" one was an edit conflict, so it's not really your fault (and it's an acceptable edit too). It's just that someone with full edit privilege was editing the post at the same time, overriding your suggested edit.

There is a question in StackExchange that deal with whether "Thanks", "Thank you" and such, should be kept or removed (edited out) on questions.

https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2950/should-hi-thanks-taglines-and-salutations-be-removed-from-postsShould 'Hi', 'thanks', taglines, and salutations be removed from posts? is always a controversial topic. Some agree that those are noise that doesn't add anything to the post, but others disagree because of social interaction (and to the extent of the recent "SO is not welcoming" uproar). While I'm on the side of "no fluff", I don't strictly enforce this policy to others. It's up to personal preference.

Why are they (the edits from moderators and high reputation users) consider better? How does the edits that would have been rejected when made by a new user or user with a low reputation be accepted when moderators and high reputation users?

Please don't take it wrong. Edits done by moderators and high reputation users (2000+ reps who can edit freely) are not always considered better. Sometimes they still make mistakes (I believe I did) because they are humans too! However, their edits are automatically applied instead of being put into a review, so they might look like "better".
However, consider the previous guideline from the help center: "Tiny, trivial edits are discouraged".
Since users having less than 2000 reps get their edits reviewed by other users, consider choosing and editing posts that really need to be fixed. For really minor typo and grammatical issues, you might be better in posting a comment to let the OP or other users fix them.


Fun fact: I learned today that Community is able to reject edit.

The Community (bot) user is able to reject edit when either an edit conflict happens (an edit suggestion is overridden by other user's edit), or when someone chooses "Reject and Edit" from the review. On the other hand, it is also able to approve edit when someone chooses "Improve Edit".

  How does the edits that would have been rejected when made by a new user or user with a low reputation be accepted when moderators and high reputation users?


Users with 2000 or above reputation points (henceforth as privileged editor) are granted a https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/editprivilege where their edits take place immediately. The system trusts a user with such reputation,  and thus, no longer puts their edits into a review queue. To put it simply, they are auto-approved by the system instead of reviewers. In case you find the criteria of points inadequate or arbitrary you can raise you issue on network's https://meta.stackexchange.com/meta.

All edits from sub-2k reputation (rep) users go into a review queue, and many reviewers consider it a https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/169348/286110waste of their time (remember, they do this voluntarily) when trivial edits are introduced and the post still needs a fix. They naturally expect a sub-2k rep editor to substantially fix a post in a single instance. Furthermore, since the system rewards sub-2k rep editors with 2 points for a successfully approved edit, the expectation is further high to ensure such editor doesn't end up gaming the system. Privileged editors do not earn rep for their edits.

That been said, content editing guidelines are applicable to all (with some modifications as introduced through guidelines' interpretation). If a privileged editor introduces trivial changes in a post which is in need of a substantial fix than they are making bad edits. However, a trivial edit (misspelling, typos and such) can be accepted if the post is already clear in understanding, in  formatting and in grammar.  If you come to notice a bad edit from anyone, than regardless of yours and their reputation points, you should consider kindly and responsibly notifying that editor (ideally via chat but can also be through comments) about the fixes needed. Responsibly means that you should fix the post yourself before highlighting the mistakes to that editor.

  Why are they (the edits from moderators and high reputation users) consider better?


Experience with qualitative edits help in making the posts better (barring few exceptions). Usually, an editor would also be a  content contributor, hence, the user would have both an increase in reputation and editing experience in parallel. So by the time they start making significantly, and at times, incredibly good edits, it is natural for an unsuspecting user to assume high-reputation user is equivalent of a qualitative editor. 

However, this is not always the case, and so, all edits, in my opinion, should ideally be reviewed at some point. Some are already done so by reviewers through edit queue, and some others by members of this community (henceforth as members) manually by checking the revisions to ensure that both reviewers and editors (regardless of points) are making only qualitative edits. Both type of reviews are voluntary. While the first one grants a recognition (badges and review counts in profile) and is relatively easy to do because of the tools available from the system, the latter is rather tedious and doesn't incentivise a member at all.

The criteria of what constitutes a better edit is available in the help page of each site in summary and explained in various posts on https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&q=%5Bsuggested-editsMeta StackExchange (read highly voted posts). It is open to interpretation and I use the https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/159983/286110opinion of jmort253 et al when reviewing a post. Since there is no rejection of edits from privileged editors, I simply make an edit on top of their edits or from an earlier revision when needed be. If the edit is destructive in intent I notify a user in comments. This is also voluntary for each privileged editor.



Now, for the editing part. Please consider using backticks (`) only for code and code-like texts. Backticks reduces readability when used outside of aforesaid texts. In this meta question, Skip does not qualify to be used with backticks. If you end up using backticks a lot in a single edit without a need, a reviewer may get irked and simply reject the edit.

Second, it is deemed unnecessary to fix misspelling or typos in many posts. Our site, unfortunately, receives a lot of posts which are in need of substantial fixes. It is better to focus your efforts on something which can be greatly improved. It would benefit us as well reward your conscience (possibly) that you did something more helpful today. :) 

And finally, see https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/184992/286110why does the Community user approve and reject edits?.

To begin with, see https://android.stackexchange.com/q/207565/287239this question. Note that it has no answers. Note also that I no longer care about the question, and would probably accept any answer, as the problem at hand has been fixed. Finally, note that I earned the tumbleweed badge from this question. 

Given this, how should I proceed? Should I...


Ignore it
Delete it
Petition to close it
Put an answer and accept it so it no longer clogs up the 'unanswered' queue.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What should I do about this question?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'd go with "4": It's neither off-topic, low quality or unanswerable (as you have an answer). If you post the answer, it might help someone else in a similar situation.


















According to https://android.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputationWhat is reputation? How do I earn (and lose) it?:

You lose reputation when:

your question is voted down: −2
your answer is voted down: −2
you vote down an answer: −1
you place a bounty on a question: − full bounty amount
one of your posts receives 6 spam or offensive flags: −100


I know that I have lost a few reputation points in the last 24 hours, however it is not reflected when I checked the "Reputation board" (don't know if it has a more appropriate name), I only see reputation points gained.
Where can I have a look at the reputation lost points?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How/where to check reputation loss?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm not sure if this is based on privilege or not, but could you see "show removed post" at the bottom of [your reputation](https://android.stackexchange.com/users/247431/reddy-lutonadio?tab=reputation)?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No, I haven't seen it.


















You do not have the privilege to https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-toolsview deleted posts  as of now, otherwise, you could have figured this out yourself. In the last 24 hours, you suffered a loss of 4 points in total, accrued from two suggested edits earlier. The two posts, both questions actually, have been deleted by Community user as part of  https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/92006/286110deleting abandoned questions. Those two questions were earlier closed, one for being off-topic and the other being unclear, and didn't meet the criteria to stay visible. Deleting a post removes points gained from a suggested edit for that post.

Tip: avoid editing blatantly https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicoff-topic posts (programming/development related questions), unless for removing personal information, since they should either be closed or be deleted. There is no good reason to improve them.

This is the same case as getting +1 rep back when an answer you downvoted gets deleted.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT.:-) Thanks for the explanation.


















As you might have inferred, I am fairly new here and not yet familiar with the site's functions.  I noticed there was a "1" indicated here (which has turned into a "5" during the time it took to write this post).

I am referring to this visual element:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/u8h6b.png

I have checked my profile page, and while there have been new activity events, there weren't any I noticed that would correlate to this number.  On the other hand, on some of my browser tabs -- specifically, ones subsequent to me examining my profile page and related pages -- the "badge" is no longer present.

This is confusing, as the tab that I had left alone to take a screenshot of updated to "5", whereas the remaining tabs did not show any change.

What causes the browser's notification badge updates on this site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5What causes the browser's notification badge updates on this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Uh, what Firelord probably meant to say: This is "Meta", where we discuss things "about our main site" – while you rather asked a technical question on Android, which would belong to the main site. Or something about how SE works – which then rather would belong to meta.stackexchange.com.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I may have caused some confusion, for which I apologize: I posted this question on Meta regarding viewing the website from a web browser (Vivaldi) on PC (Win10).  I held a presumption that the element in question originated from the site itself and not by the browser; I made such an assumption because it would seem oddly arbitrary -- maybe even invasive depending on circumstances -- for the browser to interpret and display such information arbitrarily as an external party.  However, I work in a different industry, so I had no basis for such a preconception, my apologies for any ignorance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The screenshot is quite small and doesn't hold enough details to be sure – but indeed I'd say this is a "badge" on the Android.SE icon. In that case, [Meta.SE] should indeed be the right place (that's for general questions affecting all SE sites).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5AFAIK, Stack Exchange (this site) is using WebSocket to notify the browser if there are new questions or not, and based on my previous experience on Chrome, browsers that support badge notification will show the number of updates on the browser's tab. (This was the case for pinned tab on Chrome, until Chrome removed the badge notification feature)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That sounds like the most probable cause, accounts for why only that specific tab was affected and also wouldn't have anything to do with my account activity stream.  Thank you very much for clarifying!


















Multi-line comments aren't available, precisely to discourage the kind of comments you're trying to write. Comments on this site are only temporary. You can use them to ask the author of a post to clarify something, or to explain how they can improve their post. (This includes pointing out a completely wrong answer and explaining why it's wrong.)

If someone has commented on your question and you need to add more information to the question, do this by editing the question. Being in the question itself makes it much easier for others to find the relevant information: it's available to search engines, and it keeps your question in proper order. Comments can be deleted at any time so it's important not to put any important information there.

Nobody wants to have to scroll through a pageful of comments to find the one piece of information that's needed to solve a problem. That problem that forum sites have is part of the reason why Stack Overflow was created in the first place.

Answer: Yes.



Who are you?

Hello everyone, I'm iBug, a computer science student who's about to reach his twenties, and also a passionate https://stackoverflow.com/users/5958455Stack Overflow and https://android.stackexchange.com/users/205764Android Enthusiasts user. I am also one of the primary developers of another community moderation project, https://charcoal-se.orgSmokeDetector

Earlier I came up with the idea that I could help with moderation automation on Android Enthusiasts with my development skills, so I started https://github.com/iBug/AndroidOverflowthis project, which is currently running on my personal cloud server.

What problem does this address?

As is defined by the /help/on-topicscope of this site, questions about developing for Android aren't suitable here, and need to be closed. At peak periods, we get several questions of these a day, and we're still consistently attracting development questions, even during low activity periods. With properly built tools, we could keep our site clean by closing these questions in time.

What have you done?

Late November 2018, after discussing with our moderators, I started this project, aiming to detect development questions and bring them to mods' attention, in a fully automated way. At the beginning, the program generated mod flags from my account, and was pretty error-prone.

Before the flagging ceased in early January, it generated flags on 33 posts in total, among which 10 were false positives. In addition 3 posts were flagged a second time because they were edited, and I didn't store flagging results locally to avoid that.

After the "flagging era", the program kept running for a few weeks without visible behavior, before the following project started.

On January 28, I discovered that instead of increasing moderators' workload with flags, I could use my account to vote to close those questions. Thanks to the previous improvements, the results look better than the ones from the "flagging era".

During the period January 28 to March 17, 36 questions in total attracted a close vote from the program. Only 5 of them were false positives, and the rest were all development questions. That brought the total accuracy from less than 70% from the "flagging era" to a new level of 86% so far.

So far, all runtime statuses aren't visible to the public and are only available in the console log when I log into the server. The only publicly visible activity is its close cotes cast under my account.

Here's a preview of the console log:

https://i.stack.imgur.com/XyhZP.png

Further plans

During the initial design of this project, I left space for further expansion, so its functionality would not be limited to detecting development questions, but other kinds of posts that could be moderated by the community, such as recommendation questions or Not-An-Answers. I'm planning to expand detection to new categories when the detection on development questions becomes stable.

I also had the idea of giving this project more public exposure, such as sending reports to chatrooms, so people can watch what post has been caught. A web dashboard is also on the blueprint, so that all caught posts are archived somewhere outside Stack Exchange, to serve as a public database of our posts that are caught by the bot.

However, due to the increasing workload from school assignments and tasks, I can't maintain a calendar for the plans.

Discussion, critiques and suggestions are welcome!

Very recently, Stack Exchange has revived https://twitter.com/StackExchangeits official Twitter account, @StackExchange. It had been used intermittently/actually-not-at-all for several years, but now it's being resuscitated for the express purpose of promoting awesome content around the network. As a Community Manager put it, here's what they're looking for:


  
  Awesome/interesting/fun Questions & Answers
  We'll feature a few of these per week and try to make sure that they're representative of a broad collection of our sites. This includes notable meta posts, too - though I'm guessing they'll be infrequent.
  Site events/contests
  If a site has a regular or one-off event, we may be able to tweet about some of them. Some of y'all do events throughout the year and we'd love to share some of the community-led fun.
  Users who do noteworthy work or meet celebratory rep levels
  We won't Tweet about anyone without reaching out to them first... but if there's someone you think deserves (and would appreciate) a spotlight on what they've been doing, either on main and/or meta, let us know.
  


They're looking for great posts both young and old - I have word that a "Throwback Thursday" of sorts is in the works - and given that people here have written some phenomenal stuff over the years, we definitely have lots to choose from (as well as plenty of new stuff, too). https://twitter.com/StackExchange/status/1106246229288251395Here's the first tweet, which I think is a good example.

How will this work?

There are a couple of levels to this.


First, Android Enthusiasts users will write an answer to this question with a link to the content and a short blurb about why it should be tweeted out to 17,640 people and counting. Alternatively, they can also use https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/25/android-enthusiastsour main chat room to share the idea.
Periodically (probably more regularly than I expect), the mods will go through and look at submissions. If we see stuff that looks good - and I bet that there will be lots of that - we'll forward that to the Community Team via super-secret backchannels.
A Community Manager will manually select posts to be tweeted.


Oh, I have it on good authority that here may be a Throwback Thursday-style set of tweets each week - so feel free to submit some old posts, as well as new ones!

Whatever happens, @StackExchange is going to be a great opportunity for us and the rest of the network. What content from Android Enthusiast Stack Exchange do you want to see on it?

NOTE: this post will not "expire"! At any time in the future you should encounter a good question/answer, please post it here!

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The network's official Twitter account is up and running again. What content do we want to share?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Deleted posts ;-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5So, I'm catching this late November, and, reviewing the activity on the account since March 15, it's, well, abyssmal. Two or three posts PER MONTH, and nothing at all for nearly 2 months.


















This seems a bit odd to me, especially when, e.g., sharing a link with a long URL.  More often than not you'd format the link inline to be human-readable, but the length of the URL itself is often outside the poster's control (and from what I understand, the usage of URL shortening services can be viewed as a controversial practice).  Even without considering other formatting marks, from the perspective of potential URL lengths alone, you might not be able to even share a single link within a comment (600 limit vs https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers≤ ≈2,000), even despite the hypothetical poster's intent to perhaps only have the frontend output (±) a single word.

I'm curious if this functional limitation is intentional?  Or perhaps it'd be very challenging to implement that type of evaluation on the backend?  Or does the community simply not get bothered much by it?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why do formatting marks / non-print character contribute to the character limits in comments?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm afraid we can't answer the "why" part because that's only possible for SE devs to answer it, but some users do get bothered by it: [Discourage URL shorteners in comments: don't add link's href size to the total comment size](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/267293)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. I had a feeling maybe that was the case.  On that subject, is there any resource that differentiates the "jurisdictions" (for lack of a better word at the moment) between SE and its individual communities (e.g., Venn-style infographic, etc)?  I guess in this case, I should have assumed a feature like "commenting" should be common to all of SE, but actually I have no idea how the sites' management gets structured and what types of features are universal or community-specific, etc; e.g., minimum reputation requirement to comment seems to be set per-community, not universal.

I notice that some moderators and other members lost reputation points (at least 250 points) during the last few days.

Why did they lose them? Is it a bug on the site?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why did moderators and other members lose reputation points during the few days?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Lots of users across the network were affected. You can read more on this here: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/328642b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord Thanks for the link. I didn't know that it had happened in so many sites. But a question remains: how can the system know that the user(s) deleted/removed did engage in voter fraud on all questions? Maybe it was only on some questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@ReddyLutonadio the "voting fraud" phrase is not always correct. It's just the SE staff decided not to preserve all of the user's votes after reviewing it. For more info and clarity, read the answer from the SE staff on [Please update the text in help for “User was Removed” reputation changes](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/328674)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I doubt it was "voting fraud" at all. I've lost more than 800 rep, that can hardly be from a single user's "voting fraud" (that should at least have been detected much earlier then) – though that seems to be the (rare) case here according to Meta.SE. AFAIK, if a user (or a question) is deleted only reputation younger than X (IIRC 90 days or 180 days) would be removed. TL;DR: as it was a network-wide thing, Meta.SE is the best place to seek clarification – the question Firelord linked to should be a good starting point.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I personally lost 120 rep due to a "user deletion".


















I am a stranger to the saloon but I want to give an advice.

When I enter the site. The Mr Android has a shade of blue on the banner but the tab icon has green one.

I think it looks bad. Plus since when Android wore blue?

I think the original green Mr Android should be brought back

I'm asking this question in response to the question https://android.stackexchange.com/q/201696/96277How to change the browser of a web-shortcut? (revision 3) and the accompanied comments and the answer addressing it. (Click https://i.stack.imgur.com/14ZPW.pnghere for the screenshot.)

On first reading the question is straightforward and so as the comments and the answers. The problem, however, lies where OP used this requirement of  libre/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_softwareFOSS softwares to decline non-libre suggestions, while not having it mentioned in the question at the first place, thus robbing our helpful users the chance to save their efforts in suggesting non-libre solutions. 

Now if this would have been the only problem, this could be solved by editing the question and mentioning the requirement. However, what ails me is, can this requirement be justified within the scope of this website?

Seeking software recommendations are https://android.stackexchange.com/help/on-topicoff-topic here.  While we do ask sometimes for OP to reword the question to escape the off-topic net,  our primary intention is to ensure the question remains open towards non-app based solutions as well. To admit that requirement within the scope is to  deliberately restrict the answers to app suggestions only wherever that requirement would be raised, which doesn't seem on-topic to me. Furthermore, if we permit this requirement what would prevent in future for an asker to restrict the answers to free suggestions only?

I feel that not only we would be entertaining off-topic questions, but also robbing https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.comSoftware Recommendations an opportunity to address such a  question in a fitting manner. 

So, should we allow this requirement to be business as usual or prevent it to be raised in a question?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can limiting the potential answers to libre/foss software be justified within the scope of this site?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5In an answer, one could point out that the problem can be solved via apps *like X* – and for specific app requirements ask the OP to head over and ask on SR (and ideally link to that question from the original one for everyone who wants to follow up). The answer would be perfectly OK then (showing *how* to solve the issue) – and the (understandable) FOSS requirement can be solved by other means (asking at SR).


















I have increasingly become occupied by matters which have taken a hit on my overall contribution to help increase the quality content on our site. While I'm greatly thankful to everyone who has been contributing here regardless of the question quality issues, I still want to do something better on my part (besides doing my job as a moderator).
Some moons ago I started raising bounty on answers and questions which I believe are highly insightful to the matter they dealt with.  In my humble opinion, I believe this is one of the good ways to not only appreciate good content materially, but also encourage a contributor to remain engaged with our site, and bring more useful, insightful and quality content in time.
I well very understand that reputation points should not be the primary aim of a person to contribute here (as that may lure them towards acts which could invite disciplinary action on their accounts), but I also know that the +X green notification in the top bar does feel rewarding and encouraging at times.
With this in mind, I invite all the members of our community to share posts, be they answers or questions, which they believe are worthy of appreciation.

Criteria for post selection
Here's the criteria that you may use to judge the content of an answer:

the content cannot easily be found or compiled from the internet;
the content proved significant to help increase your knowledge base or skill set;
the content deals more with fundamentals of a concept, and hacks, instead of merely mentioning some X program's usage;
the content to your satisfaction answers the question.

And here's the criteria that you may use to judge the content of a question:

the issue cannot easily be solved by doing web search (including advanced Google search);
the issue pertains to a problem with the OS (even if OEM skin specific) or a concept, than just being with an app;
the asker has attempted to at least exhaust options to address their problem themselves;
when the above criteria are met and the asker has significantly low reputation points to raise a bounty on their own;


How to share a post?
One post One suggestion
For answer posts, post an answer below like this prefixed by ###:

Bounty proposal for the https://android.stackexchange.com/a/28315Answer to https://android.stackexchange.com/q/28296How to fully backup non-rooted devices?

For question posts, simply link the question encapsulated by its heading prefixed by ### like this:

Bounty proposal for the Question: https://android.stackexchange.com/a/28315How to fully backup non-rooted devices?

You are free to mention the name of the contributor and why you believe a bounty should be considered by community members for that post.
Note: when a bounty has been successfully awarded, please edit the relevant answer post below and highlight at the top "Bounty awarded" followed, optionally, by the bounty issuer's name.

When to award a bounty?
Being a free (as in freedom) member you can give bounty to any post you deem fit at anytime (subjected to rules of Stack Exchange). The answers below are only meant to bring to our "attention" the content (and the contributors) as a centralized repository of content we value.

Notes

given that our consistent answer contributors are a handful in strength, multiple posts from a contributor are eligible. Furthermore, a contributor is free to suggest their own answers (not questions) if they believe their answer meets the criteria.
I personally want to focus more on users who are sub-2k and sub-3k reputation because those are the checkpoints that grants rights to engage more on the moderation side and feel genuinely as being an important part of the functioning of the site without necessarily relying on the moderators, as is the case with flagging.
this whole idea stands upon voluntary contribution, so there shall be no moral mandate on any user, regardless of their reputation and moderation rights, to raise a bounty.

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Let's raise some bounty for well-written Q&Asb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Good initiative, will encourage community members to focus more on sharing knowledge than just asking for or giving tips and tricks. And though at the moment they don't seem to pay much heed to your proposal, you yourself have been doing it very well, in my opinion. Appreciated.


















I think https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-10android-10 is appropriate with https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-qandroid-q as the synonym. This is also according to what Google uses on https://www.blog.google/products/android/evolving-android-brand/its blog.


  Android Q is Android 10




About the past Android versions, for naming consistency, I'm thinking of renaming them to https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-version.number-codenameandroid-version.number-codename, e.g. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-9-pieandroid-9-pie because it's also what Google uses on their introduction page:


https://www.android.com/versions/pie-9-0/Android 9 Pie
https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/Android 8.0 Oreo
https://www.android.com/versions/nougat-7-0/Android 7.0 Nougat
etc...


However, this is a low priority and I'm okay with leaving the current tags as-is because I don't see additional benefits to be gained. (Users will just search for '9' or 'pie' without using 'android' when searching for a tag)



Additional remark: there's also https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-oneandroid-one which follows the "Android [number]" pattern but unrelated to Android versioning at all. However, I don't think there will be a problem since there's no https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/android-1android-1 (the first version of Android) and its related questions yet.

Given the close development relationship with Android I was wondering if ChromeOS questions are acceptable here.

I couldn't see any documentation in the site help specifically prohibiting or allowing questions on this topic so I thought I would get the community's opinion and some sort of consenus.

The other option is that ChromeOS questions are the domain of https://superuser.com/SuperUser.

Let me give an example:

I asked this question: https://android.stackexchange.com/q/148684/306191Disable "Close all incognito tabs" notification?. 
To which I gave https://android.stackexchange.com/a/216810/306191this answer.

Would it be okay to give this answer considering it was not possible to use this solution when this question was asked?

In the answer, I also said that the solution may not work with some devices, which makes me think it is okay to do so, but still...

It's New Year's Day in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_TimeStack Exchange land...

A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:


  We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
  -- http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/A Theory of Moderation


While there certainly are https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/Moderators here, a significant amount of the moderation is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.

As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together. 
And what could be more festive than a big pile of numbers? 
So here is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on Android Enthusiasts over the past 12 months:

¹ "Community" here refers both to https://android.stackexchange.com/usersthe membership of Android Enthusiasts without https://android.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderatorsdiamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as https://android.stackexchange.com/users/-1user #-1.

² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.

³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-userGenerally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.

⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.

⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes).

⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.

⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

Stack Exchange has a limit of five pending suggested edits per user. This is to prevent users from flooding the suggested-edits queue with tiny edits (e.g. adding a tag) to dozens of questions.

I have https://android.stackexchange.com/users/33123/unforgettableidsupportsmonica?tab=activity&sort=suggestionsfive pending suggested edits, and so I can't submit any more. Mine aren't tiny edits; they're more substantial.

In fact, I've had five pending suggested edits for most of the past week.

My question

A) If you have 2,000 reputation or more, could you please help to https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-editsprocess the suggested-edits queue?

An additional thought

B) Perhaps it might make sense to raise the limit to 10 or 20 pending suggested edits, to make the limit more difficult to hit on smaller Stack Exchange sites like ours.

First of all, welcome to Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange, a Q&A site focusing on Android end-users solving their issues. Consider taking a quick https://android.stackexchange.com/tourtour to get a short introduction on how Stack Exchange works in general.

Regarding the reason why the question was closed, ignoring the fluff/rambling, there are at least more than 1 tangential questions:


Change the audio stream's volume for the ringer, media, notification, and assistant (Android provides many different audio streams, but it is up to the manufacturer/ROM on how to manage them)
Adjust the Assistant's volume to the user's speech volume and customize its behavior on non-verbal activation (personally, I'm not sure if this is even possible at all)
Silencing/muting the phone without looking at the screen (there are alternative solutions like automation and "do not disturb" mode)


While all of them are related to audio volume, solutions to one issue are possibly unrelated to other issues, making it unfocused (previously known as "too broad - multiple questions on a single post").

The problem with multiple questions on a single post is, answerers are expected to solve all the issues, preventing them from posting an answer if they only know the solution to an issue or two. Evaluating the answers also becomes difficult since an answer may contain a good solution to one issue but poor solution to another, while another answer provides vice-verse, making it a confusing situation for the voters and future readers.

Take note that developer-related questions (like asking for the API and how to build a ROM) are generally discouraged since the user-base of this community is Android end/power-users, but not necessarily developers.

The fix is to separate these issues into multiple posts, one focusing on a specific topic. Before posting a new question, please also search for existing questions to prevent duplicates.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I have already searched for and installed so many volume-control apps, and not of them work.

The question is mostly about if it is even possible with API, but it was closed on the programming version of this site, and they told me to post it here.

I could rephrase and indicate why it is a single question, but I don't know how to unclose the post.

I need granular control of volume control, and I couldn't find apps in the play store that do it.  I found ones that claimed to do it, but didn't.  Which makes me believe that Google made their OS unusable. I filed feature/bug requests there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I'm pretty confused, because I just tried to edit the post to make it be those 3 parts... but they are all programming questions... and it wouldn't let me make even 1 narrow post. 

Is there a fork of stack exchange that manages  tangents in all their glory instead of ending them? I can't solve a problem in isolation.  That post was intended to be:  This is how volume controls need to work, how do I get there?

Ref- https://android.stackexchange.com/q/34793/131553Scan Barcode and QR code from the mobile screen itself

https://android.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/222277Edit history for this question shows that a moderator rejected the edit four months ago (for reasons I also agree with), but this edit is approved few minutes ago by OP so it stands approved (See 
https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/76251/308746How do suggested edits work?). 

The approved edit brings about a fundamental change to the question, making the existing answers only partly correct and relevant. Someone visiting the question today (it is on the home page) may actually down vote the answers as they don't match the question body. It's another matter that the approved edit made changes to the body but not to the title of question. 

I doubt if 7 years back when the question was posted, QR codes were a thing. Bringing that in the scope of question now, is meaningless. 

To give another example, USB Type C charging wasn't around about four years ago. If OP of a question approves an edit that brings Type-C charging into the ambit, we would have a similar problem (if the question was posted pre Type-C days) 

IMO, moderators should rollback the edit approval in this instant case. That's the easy part (hopefully moderators can do that based on this meta post, a cursory check threw up
https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/64459/308746Rolling back a completely changed question) 

How to ensure it doesn't happen in future is the difficult part since OP exercises similar power to that of moderator, in edit approval / rejection. 
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Edit approval that changes the question - what should be done?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Slightly related remark: due to [how the layout appears](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/295028/241919), some users may not realize that the "Approve" button shown on the rejected suggested edit actually overrules the community's decision, instead of "I approve this review decision", so it might be an honest mistake.


















For the moment, I have edited the question to separate the new objective of OP (QR codes part) and mentioned it as a new paragraph along with the date on which the objective was introduced. I know that mentioning date was a redundant step as a reader can easily see the dates from edit history. However, given the problem at hand of invalidation and effectiveness/comprehensiveness (E/C) of the existing answers, I went ahead with redundancy.

Usually, whenever my answer was invalidated or its E/Cs reduced by an edit from OP I used to comment to OP that they should consider my work and efforts into consideration first since their edit is in gross disrespect of my efforts. That said, if OP reverted the edit than the problem was disposed of. But if OP persisted with the edit, I either marked my answer with the heading that it was answered with respect to original question (with hyperlink to corresponding edit) or I deleted my answer (in cases when the whole answer was invalidated).

These cases had happened mostly when I was not a moderator, and since I used to be the only answer contributor I used to choose deletion or edit of my own posts instead of moderator attention. 

In your case though, I do not want to revert the edit because QR codes now are widespread in use and potential solutions to barcode question might have support for QR codes as well. Given the question quality issues, I wager we might (if we haven't already) end up with a duplicate of that same question (with "QR code" as the changed terms) and answers common to both.

For containing duplicate or common answers in this case alone I chose not to revert the edit.

That said, I share your concern. Had one or more answers been fully invalidated, I  in all likelihood could have taken your suggested route.


  How to ensure it doesn't happen in future is the difficult part since OP exercises similar power to that of moderator, in edit approval / rejection. 


We can't unless we on technical level prevent OP from approving a rejected edit. But this change would have to be discussed on the network meta.

Personally, I'm not in support of preventing OP from approving a rejected edit. Often times, an OP approves a rejected edit when OP alone is able to make sense that the edit is aligned with their question's intent. The edit you mentioned is once in a while misuse of edit privileges by an OP. Unless statistics dictate that this problem affects a lot of our answer contributors or site's quality control, I suggest we put this proposal for rest until it gathers traction on network meta.

I thought of this solution of editing it myself to mention the date but didn't do that precisely for the reason of duplicates (I didn't check). 2. I too faced this "changing goalposts" problem and my solution was to edit and say "in response to edit made to question or comment" 3. I agree that this is not a blatant misuse as my last link showed but shared it to show a precedence 4. I know and agree OP knows best if edit is right or not but bringing up the "hard part" was to subtly encourage greater scrutiny 5.

I've been discovering Android Enthusiasts SE and although I kind of like the topic, my impression is that this SE is not doing great. I've been active on a few other SE sites for some time and one can really tell the difference. Apparently there's just not enough regular active members for the flow of questions (https://stackexchange.com/sites#technology-traffic58% answered). Crucially there are very few votes being cast, and this is quite bad given that the SE model relies on votes.

More downvotes :
I understand that for question asking, if quality is low or it looks like there was not sufficient effort or time put into asking a question it can be downvoted.

I feel like by penalizing downvotes we are discouraging people from holding answers to higher standards.

Interested to hear you guys thoughts on this

I understand that for question asking, if quality is low or it looks like there was not sufficient effort or time put into asking a question it can be downvoted.

So what I'd like to know is:

Why so few people vote? Is it because there are not enough "avid members", too much turn-over, too many questions, questions being too specialized (or not enough)... ?

What can be done about it? (if anything) More precisely, as a modest active member, what should I prioritize? 
For instance, I've seen other sites which encourage:


https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/10/19/vote-early-vote-often/Vote early and vote often: should I vote on questions/answers even if I don't feel very confident about the topic?
voting to close out-of-scope/unclear questions early (and harshly) in order to force the user to clarify before (possibly) re-opening. But of course, that's not very welcoming.
be more strict about duplicates: many beginners questions are variants of existing questions, should I vote to close as duplicate even if it's not exactly the same question?
any other suggestion...?

b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Why so few people to vote?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hi and welcome to Android.SE :) This is a known long-term issue and has been a big topic in previous elections (further reading: [Role of Moderators and others in increasing the strength and involvement of the backbone of the community](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2465)). While all the answers are insightful, I'd particularly put the highlight on [iBug's answer](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2468/44325) since it very relates to me personally: the Android fragmentation itself. Most often, I don't have confidence in (up/down/duplicate)-voting on troubleshooting questions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5(also, the linked questions on that question, including [How can we spend some effort on improving our overall activity?](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2380) from 2017 and [You need the bourgeois blues](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/578) from 2011)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As brought out, this is an old issue with no real solutions. Only suggestion is *be the change, you want to see!*, in other words, vote as much  as you can except of course when the quality is poor or wrong or not meeting site standards (link only answers etc)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Do to others what you want from them to do to you. By your voting, try to inject the maximal information into the system. The maximum is if you vote about third of the posts up, third of them down, and third abstain. You do not want to lose the -1 on answer downs, so downvote answers only if they really deserve. Read also [this](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2627/50837).


















I don't think so; such questions are broad, open ended and don't have a definitive best answer. Therefore, https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/98366/295232they're not a good fit for Stack Exchange's Q&A format. See also the Help Center article https://android.stackexchange.com/help/dont-askWhat types of questions should I avoid asking?:

You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.
Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much.

Older Stack Exchange might still have some of these questions, but they're often locked and they're just kept for reference and not for maintenance.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Also, even if there still are on other SE sites, they are more of an exception than a norm (like [big list](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/big-list) questions on Math.SE).


















I am wondering if we need to have a re-look at the https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2206/131553accepted answer which is the de-facto policy.

Context: 


I flagged about 30 answers for deletion today having “Sound About" App as the answer. AFAIR, this app worked fine till Android 7.0, meaning it served the advertised purpose for users on 4.3 to 7.x.Let's have a look at the https://infogram.com/android-10-distribution-1h7g6k3jy0lo2oydistribution chart


https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sUp5.jpg

The crux of the reason in accepted answer is


  All the people the answer might have helped have been helped and have moved on; it's not useful to anyone any more. And because it's no longer useful, there's the risk that future visitors might downvote the answer



Now, if you compare with the infographic, it would show that the answer is still relevant and useful to about 40% of users, and visitors /users of the site are deprived of this working answer (unless they have the reputation to view deleted answers). This aspect is not considered in the accepted answer
It's certainly not my case that one compares every such case with distribution (more so, when https://www.androidauthority.com/android-distribution-chart-1105405/Google stopped providing these inputs) but to to have a re-look, and decide if this policy is in the best interests of the site.


Alternatives?


Users flag, answers are not deleted and AppBrain links be added as suggested here https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2500/131553Should app dependent answers with dead links be replaced with AppBrain's links?. 
Users flag, answers are not deleted. A mod points to the above question, so that future visitors know both - the app is unavailable and where they can look for it (this can be done by users too, but it's better handled at mod level, since some apps are available in selected regions only and wrong comments need to be cleaned up) 
Something better? 


Edit: One more reason not to delete is the reputation loss, which https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7237/how-does-reputation-work/7238#7238happens unless (Thanks to Andrew for clarification) 


  reputation earned for posts with a score of 3 or higher, and where the post has been visible on the site for at least 60 days, is retained


This means that users may stand to lose reputation, if they don't meet the above conditions for no fault of theirs! Possible reputation loss was briefly mentioned in question and comments without perhaps taking the specifics into consideration. 

It may be best to retain answers IMO, without deletion and as suggested in question, prepend a "quoted emphasized" block with details (a la "this answer is no longer valid because…")  with additional link to AppBrain
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Pointing the link to Appbrain (instead of removing it entirely or let it rot) has the clear advantage that a visitor can scroll down there and check the alternatives proposed. Wish we had the possibility to "lock answers" (to prevent downvoting effectively), keeping them as "frozen piece of time". But I guess the edit it the way you suggest would at least be better than removing it entirely, though it still leaves the chance of "unjust downvotes". We need to decide by-case anyway; some questions might be "frozen" (locked) entirely if the issue no longer applies to recent versions.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51.The warning could start with "Don't down vote" (no guarantees it will prevent) 2.  Case by case approach is better (though prone to human inconsistency) since answer locking isn't possible 3.Another extreme could be locking the question itself to prevent any voting / comments ("historical reasons"  (IIRC), to say "we are not accepting answers.....). Agreed, it is an extreme interpretation of historical but the lock warming could also include reasons and App rain link. This, on the face of it seems to be" win - win "for all - no deletion, no up or down votes, no rep loss, alternatives //b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Presented to readers. This by far would be ideal in terms of "fossilized questions". 4. Another possibility could be adding this reason to community driven closure, a variant of option 3. In short, anything but don't delete (though I up voted deletion option in past and did flag) but that info graphic which I happened to see just after flagging set me thinking very differently. Unfortunately, the community isn't active on meta, so it's difficult to get their view so mods have to end up deciding the best course but to me option 3 appears best.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Well, we could ask for a "freeze historical answers" feature. But that at best would take quite a while to become available, if accepted at all…b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy we can lock answers permanently, but the available justifications are -- content dispute, comments dispute, wiki. Any of these justifications would only confuse the visitors if the lock is used for any other reason.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Hm, wouldn't "wiki(fied) for historical reasons" fit then @Firelord?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Don't know. We can go ahead. If somebody complaints about being confused with that notice we would have to ask a for [feature-request], but till than, this can be used.

[How can we spend some effort on improving our overall activity?](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2380/96277). You are welcome to help us out, even by a suggestion there. :-)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I don't mean to be facetious, but I had a good answer, I really did, but just got bored writing it. I abandoned it. Also, I'm avoiding the site. It doesn't appear so, since I'm back once a day, and I read regularly. I just won't answer a question that clearly shows no effort to read what has gone before. This site was designed to be a reference used for self-help, but is being used poorly, without the effort of the "self-", leaving just the lazy "help". . . ."Gimme my answer!", "Got it!", "See ya!".b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5For me the main issue of the lack of votes is that many questions get automatically removed by Roomba (= Stack Exchange's automated question deletion script). See [Decrease the required view count to prevent Roomba deletion when score = 0 on smaller sites](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/355097/178179).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5*Be the change you want to see* is the only mantra I follow (I have raised similar concerns in elections [in 2018](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2462/131553))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As someone who upvotes good questions and answers, I am always surprised by how many people choose not to upvote good posts.  It costs you nothing, it makes someone happy, and it helps the community. It's a win-win-win situation, and yet so few people choose to upvote good posts.  I also regularly see community members answering questions, but not upvoting the question they are answering.  If a question is worthy of me taking my time to answer it, I think the question is worthy of a simple upvote.


















I think, the Android SE is one of the hardest sites to earn rep. I believe it is no good. https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A50837%20is%3Aa%20created%3A2019-03-01..2019-03-31My answers in 2019/03 were created because I wanted to get to 200 on the site. The nearly complete lack of reaction (incl. lack of ups) were something what I nowhere on the SE experienced before that. I found also very hard to find answerable questions. Finally I gave up and got to 200 by edits.
The bad thing is that the site stabilized itself in a state, where its quality content is well-preserved, but on the price that it prevents its growth.
The good thing is that reaching a "critical mass", I do not close out an exponential growth in the future.
A major problem of Android, internet-wide, is the terrible amount of crap content. Anybody hunted for something in Android and also with an other technology, see this very characteristic difference. The overwhelming majority of Android content, what we can find by google searches, would be - well deservedly - quickly deleted on the Android SE.
This is an external property of the world in which we live, we can not change it, but we can adapt it. Be the change, suggested @beeshyams in a comment, and I think he is very right, so for you induvidually and also for us, collectively.
Having 15 rep, nothing avoids you to vote daily 40 posts up (please do not this on the price of decreasing the quality), and also the site can reach a critical mass, where it will be known for the googlers, that the probability of getting useful information in a google search result list, is high.
Having a well-going Android SE is our group interest. While we apply the rules for induvidual cases, we should not only see, which action matches best the site customs. We have a significant freedom, what exactly we do, and we should also consider, which possible action serves the best our group interest.
I think the community is not very healthy in this sense.
We should actively work on

To increase the chance of new users (particularly, answerers) to visit the site again. In all review/voting/edit/comment decision, we should consider this.
To tune the content (mostly, by edits) for the googlers of the future.

My experiences are mostly positive, if I had a question, and mostly negative if I had an answer (I work a lot on the answer, and then no upvote, no comment, nothing).
A remark: There is a CM stat (based on data not available for mortals), that new users don't really bother on their scores. They want reactions. Surprisingly, not always answers - if they get comments, or even edits, it is nearly so good. And the worst effect to their re-visit is, also surprisingly, not if their posts are downvoted, but if it remains un-reacted. So, beside your vote, always give them something (edit, comment) which can be created only by a human. Focus your efforts to the users looking higher qualified.
I would add to that: people with 3-digit rep, want upvotes. Motivate them with your ups. Never giving ups is not better than giving always. Reward them easily, but never reward for nothing. Trivial math is that you inject the maximal information in the system, if your voting decisions between upvote, abstain and downvote are distributed in the 1:1:1 ratio. We don't like answer downs, an in general we want to attract people, so my suggestion is this:
Vote about half of the posts up, abstain in half the cases, and give downs only in very obvious cases.

There is another problem what I see. This is the https://data.stackexchange.com/android/query/1247764/count-of-question-creation-closure-and-deletion-events-by-month#graphCount of question creation, closure and deletion events by month:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/kpVxG.png
In my opinion, this stat clearly shows a site which is actively working on to prevent its own growth. I think you should dig into its reason, because this stat is simply deadly. Particularly the deletion spikes in 2016/10 and in early 2019 would deserve some investigation. Expelling users also prevents their future contributions to ever created, not only their posts, but also their votes.
Dear mods, voters, anybody caused these: if a post is bad, but salvageable, it is better to leave it in that state than deleting it. The deletion closes out the possibility of improving it ever.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think also the site self-determination ("android enthusiasts") is sub-optimal. It shows that it is an android user forum. This is not what we want to be. I think we want to be a diverse mixture of android gurus, phone hackers, app developers and simple rooted phone users, *where you can get the answer for your old, long-standing questions which would not be even understood in most android sites*.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I see also the site design as shooting ourself on the foot. It is blue. Wtf? An android site should be green. It is because the droid mascot is green. Everybody knows that. You don't need to be a professional designer to know that on the spot. I have simply no idea, what could have been in the head of the responsible person who created this blue design.


















I feel like people may get the impression that something is wrong with this site because the major color highlight (from the header bar) is blue, which used to be the Windows Phone OS color, and Android is commonly known as the "green" mobile OS.
Here's a visual example of how it could be improved with 2 simple css rules:
.site-header {
    background-color: HSL(80, 90%, 47%);
}

.site-header img {
    filter: hue-rotate(120deg) invert(100%);
}

https://i.stack.imgur.com/7LbVU.png
If rendered to an image, no CSS would be required. Since this is just a recolor, essentially, it shouldn't take a long time to think this over with a designer. What do you think?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How about making the header bar and logo green like the Android mascot, instead of blue?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I personally want to see a design overhaul, may be something artistic, like what [anime.se], [workplace.se] and [worldbuilding.se] have. Ever since 2015 , when they introduced this new design, I have tried hard but continued to find the design uninspiring. The problem is that we are a technology site, and I don't see any technology site looking aesthically appealing compared to culture / recreation and life / arts websites in SE network, so I don't know what exactly I am looking for.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I guess it's a dupe of https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2560/44325, https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2464/44325, and https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1918/44325...b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I believe the blue color was certainly influenced by Google's Material Design and how it's so blue (that even [the official Android Developer site uses it](https://developer.android.com/docs) and it's [the default toolbar color for a new Flutter project](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab#step-1-create-the-starter-flutter-app))b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. first time I am seeing Android dev site in blue. I always got specific results from the web  for that website and the blue color was not predominant in such pages. Than there is source.android.com missing the blue, so I have had a different experience, lacking blue most of the time. But yeah, you make a good point. It is probable the designers were influenced by Google's MD.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As far as I know, Anime&Manga site design had been in the works and reworks and delays for many years, but in the end the company bought what you see and it took roughly 3-4 months to implement (I can be wrong about the final attempt duration). So maybe if you find a designer for hire and refer them to SE to contract, to minimize effort on their part, it's more likely to get done imo than if we just do nothing and wait forever.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My workaround has been: .site-header { display: none; }. I like less clutter... and scrolling. :)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord I think an open letter on the MSE would have some (little) chance. If it is only a 2-line css change, more than little.


















You don't need reputation (that's how we call it) to ask questions (or answer them); you can already do that at https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/create-posts1 reputation. You do need https://android.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment50 reputation to comment.
You gain reputation by asking good questions or providing good answers; other community members can upvote them and you'll get 10 reputation for each upvote. Another common way (where I got most of my reputation from) is to https://android.stackexchange.com/help/editingsuggest edits to improve existing posts; if one of those edits is approved, you'll get 2 reputation.

I could ask a question on the problem I'm seeing but I've already seen at least two other posts on it, and netiquette dictates that I use existing post/threads rather than recreating a new on that has already been addressed.

I have additional info on the problem but I can't comment on it to give the information.

The oldest two of the four seem to have some relevance to Samsung devices of that era.  There probably was a widget of that name and the questions are valid.
The newest two of those four questions seem to have the tag added just because it was offered to the OP at the time of posting and they just went with it.
For the oldest two, the tag is probably still of use if people have those devices.  In this case there is no reason to delete the tag.
For the newest two, simply remove the tag as it is irrelevant.

I've been active in the review queues, and the number of poorly written questions seems to be increasing.
I fully respect that not everyone is skilled with the English language, and I work hard to clean up posts in which it's obvious that the poster has limited English skills.
But recently, the number of posts with many obvious spelling errors has increased.  Sometimes the letters in some of the words are so jumbled that I honestly can't figure out what words they are trying to use.  These posts also often lack standard punctuation, capitalization, and use of paragraphs.
Spell-checkers are available on all modern devices, so it's possible that this behavior is driven by laziness and/or lack of interest in effective writing.
How can we encourage people to proofread their own posts with the goal of them fixing their many errors before posting in our community?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How can we encourage people to proofread their own posts?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5As a mod and a prolific editor, I just want to say this is a good question without a solution. There were some discussions/feature requests, like one in 2014 on MSE: [Require questions to pass a spell-checker](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/228817/241919).


















When flagging a question as off-topic, Software Recommendations SE is not currently listed.  Can we get it added?
For those that don't know, Software Recommendations StackExchange is here:
https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.comhttps://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Can we add Software Recommendations SE as a destination for when an off-topic question needs migration?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I think a CM has to be asked for this. We mods don't have an option to add a migration site ourselves (I don't see one). As for the request, we do receive a good share of questions asking for app recommendation (not on a daily basis though) and it would make it easy for flag raisers / close voters to flag/vote for migration there.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Firelord Do you think the request would be best received if it came from a mod?  If so, can you or one of the other mods do it if you are all in agreement and the community doesn't object?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5While I can confirm we receive a good share of app questions, only few of them are suited for migration. Most would require severe rephrasing to fit site rules at SR, see [Where to ask for app recommendations?](https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2060/16575) Being a mod on both sites, I might have to reject migrations from the other end then ;) But as the same can be said for any other "migration targets", please don't count that as objection. Need to ask my co-mods at SR, but I think we'd not be opposed to this – two of us already indicated that here, just Nicolas is missing :Db2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I agree... some of the Q would take a bit of work to fit on SR.  I'm hoping that we could come up with a quick way to say "Hi... now that you're question is on SR, please read the SR guidelines and edit as needed".  Worse comes to worse, if the experiment fails, we can always remove the new option from Android SE.  I'm hoping for 3 outcomes: (1) fewer OT questions on Android SE, (2) more OT questions on SR SE, (3) more general awareness of SR SE (we don't get as many Android app requests as one might expect, given the popularity of Android).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@RockPaperLz-MaskitorCasket (1) is unlikely to happen by this. As for the quality: it needs 5 user-votes to get a migration through – until then a mod should have had a chance to "hammer it the other way" (i.e. close it as OT with a hint to re-ask, pointing to above link), so I consider the risk of low-QQs being migrated rather low. Should we be wrong, it can be reverted. (3) will be achieved for users with close privileges. // PS: As Firelord pointed out, we can edit "custom close reasons" but I couldn't find a link for migration targets either. Nor one to contact CM, by the way.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The current SOP is to [tag the question with 'status-review'](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/348642/241919). However, we still need to [provide strong arguments as answers that the migration path worths](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/241919) //cc: @Izzyb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. "2. That topic is asked about daily on the former site." Is it? Weekly we could say, but daily I don't think. So would we even stand a chance? We could try, though – it's about adding 1 site to the migration path, and SR is the one we encounter most frequently. Then quite a gap before another one "occasionally" shows up. Guess it's a 50:50 chance.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy well, it certainly worths trying. We don't have much stat about this migration path because we've been closing them aggressively in the first place  (same for HardwareRecs.SE)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Glad this finally hit the system. Seems there are other similar questions here on meta, including mine created in early 2014. Maybe they could be addressed (or add [duplicate] flags to redirect here).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@wbogacz I have closed your question as a duplicate of this one.

It depends on the OS and the nature of the question.
As far as I know, Lenovo tablets are packaged with either Android, Windows, or Chrome OS.
To put it simply:

If it's about doing something about the Android OS, then it's mostly on-topic here.
Else, if it's about operating Windows, installing *nix-based OS, etc., then it's highly possibly off-topic (try other sister sites like https://superuser.com/Super User, https://unix.stackexchange.com/Unix & Linux, https://askubuntu.com/Ask Ubuntu, etc.)

So, IMO, it should be very much on topic on this site, unless proved that it's independent of Android.
PS: If this position is agreeable to the community, a separate tag needs to be created.

The answer to your question was a link-only answer. Here's a copy of that:

See this video "Cast Android screen to Android": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UoZadzMnokhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UoZadzMnok

That answer, in its entirety, contained only a link to a video. Not even to a text-based resource! Such posts are classified as Very Low Quality (VLQ) posts. They are more like throwing a bone. Lazily (more like reluctantly) written. Such answers might prove to be helpful to some users, but they are usually very bad and often require a lot of efforts on part of a reader to extract usefulness from such links. As such, they are usually voted out by community members to be deleted or are instantly deleted by moderators.
That answer was deleted by me. Given the activity of the user on the whole Stack Exchange network the user is unlikely to return here and fix their answer. Should the user returns, they can always post a new and a better answer. So no harm done.
As for you, if the link helped you out then please do post a self-answer and accept it, along with the steps that you found useful from that video. If you just post a link too, then your answer won't be any different than from the aforesaid user, and might be flagged by Community bot or community members as VLQ.

They can still fix it, and we'll undelete it when needed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I understand and agree with what happened.  It's somewhat ironic though that in two days no one else has given an answer and I was lucky to catch that answer when I did.  Had it not been for that inappropriate answer, I still wouldn't have a solution.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT., I *have* posted a self-answer, but if the original answer is improved and reposted, I'll get rid of mine.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/242690/why-would-app-x-need-permission-yWhy would App X need permission Y?
was closed as opinion-based, but it is definitely not. Closing the question prevents the community from exchanging knowledge.
Questions:

Are decision-makers appraisal sometimes too biased?

Is this one such case?
TL;DR

The question is completely technical, with very specific, non-opinion-based, possible answers. There might be more than one answer for this question, as https://android.stackexchange.com/a/217765/81584here or https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/96209/how-can-i-root-the-micromax-a110q/109337#109337here.
Those who could know an answer include:

Developers or others somehow connected to (now or in the past) apps referred to. E.g., https://play.google.com/store/search?q=sound%20meterQuery: Sound Meter, https://play.google.com/store/search?q=noise%20meterQuery: Noise Meter, etc.
Developers or others somehow connected to (now or in the past) related open source projects. E.g. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.piemonte.arpa.openoiseOpeNoise?, https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.quaap.audiometer/AudioMeter, https://github.com/jeff2900/Sound-MeterSound-Meter, https://opensoundmeter.com/Open Sound Meter, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/54720/why-does-sound-recorder-in-cyanogenmod-need-network-permissionSound Recorder.
These are examples of people who may know the rationale for what I am asking, by being related to the topic at hand (even if not Android app devs themselves at this time).

One could argue about the chances that those who know an answer would show up here and post an answer, but that by no means make this opinion-based.
The only way to know this is leaving the question open. It might not get answers... same as https://android.stackexchange.com/search?q=answers%3A0these 14330 questions.
Those who don't know an answer may guess, recall, have seen at one point, suggest, etc., etc... so what could be tagged as opinion-based are the possible answers (and comments).
And these may be useful as well. This evaluation is opinion-based (the core of the voting system!!).
Examples: https://android.stackexchange.com/a/98278/81584this, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/226552/unlocked-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultras-hotspot-is-only-limited-to-1-connection#comment295870_226552this, https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/189406/galaxy-s5-charging-slowly-despite-ac-and-2a-charger/189428#189428this.
In addition, people not knowing the answer, may have ideas about alternative/better ways to get to an answer, and that is also an answer on its own.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Closing question too biased?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for bringing this to the meta. As the sole-closer of the question, since I have a conflict of interest, I will defer the discussion to the co-mods and community first before I provide my reasoning.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. - Quite fair.


















The wording could be improved.  It would be clearer if it said something like:

Questions regarding replacing Android with Linux distros are
off-topic.

If you are running a variety of Linux on your hardware, then you are almost certainly not running Android.
This site is for Android, so putting Android onto a Linux box is on-topic, but not the other way around.

as it should. Maybe SE depreciating Android version is the reason
Just wanted to confirm (this is in italics because it is on laptop)
Edit: Switched to mobile and realized that italics don't render on mobile display but do on laptop. So, italicize on mobile but don't expect to see it, unless this issue is fixed, which is unlikely.

On every Stack Exchange site, there is https://android.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community?tab=profilea Community user bot that likes to randomly bump unanswered questions. Based on my observations, we got an almost consistent hourly bump every day, and that might dilute the "active" tab and the homepage from more recently active questions with very old questions that usually cannot be evaluated anymore due to a few reasons.
As per https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48578/what-can-cause-a-question-to-be-bumped/48579#48579the FAQ about question bumping, 2 factors can be adjusted on this bot:


The maximum number of unanswered questions bumped per hour depends on the site: 4 per hour on Stack Overflow, 2 per hour on Super User and Server Fault, and 1 per hour on Meta Stack Exchange and all other sites.
Some sites have limits on how many auto-bumped questions can appear on the homepage. Once the limit is reached, no more questions will be bumped until one or more bumped questions disappears off the homepage.


As for the maximum number of unanswered questions bumped per hour, I have confirmed with the Community Manager team that the minimum is 1, so it is already the minimum possible number.
However, the other one about the limit on auto-bumped questions on the homepage is currently not set. Based on my observations, out of 50 questions, our homepage usually had at least 20+ from community bumping only. That was almost 40%-50% of old questions filling the homepage.
I recently tried to keep up with all the bumped questions to check if I can evaluate them. Unfortunately, in addition to the lack of knowledge, the fact that Android is so fragmented made it hard to evaluate, since one device/Android version may behave very differently from another.
So, should the community bot reduce the frequency of bumping unanswered questions?

This is somewhat related to a discussion in 2013, https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1505/what-should-we-do-with-older-questions-that-just-arent-relevant-any-moreWhat should we do with older questions that just aren't relevant any more?. While we may revisit the discussion to tackle this issue in the future, existing questions will still be bumped by the bot.
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Should the Community bot reduce questions bumping? (Update: now reduced, but further action needed)b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5My vote is in favour of reducing the frequency. I am inclined to reduce it to atmost "One" autobump on homepage. Until that is removed from the page, no more bumps. I'm interested in knowing how many of these auto-bumped questions get answered on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Sadly, I don't know how to construct a query on SE's Data Explorer to get this data. :(b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Eagle-eye :) Good find. 20 out of 50 is definitely overdoing it. I'd not go that extremely down as Firelord, but "more" isn't always better. Up to 5 I'd find OK (that's about 10% then).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5That also would be great to reduce the frequency of Roomba: [Decrease the required view count to prevent Roomba deletion when score = 0 on smaller sites](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/355097/178179), since many questions here have score = 0.


















Some answers include links to Google Play Store apps that no longer exist in the Google Play Store.
How is it best to handle these answers?
The most obvious solution is to see if the app exists on https://f-droid.orgF-Droid, and if it does, change the link to the appropriate page on F-Droid.  But that only solves the issue for several thousand apps (out of millions).
How do we want to handle these answers that reference apps not available on F-Droid?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How to handle answers that include links to Google Play Store apps that no longer exist in that store?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5FWIW, this has been covered in previous discussions. The current consensus seems to delete the answers while letting the OP knows that the Play Store links are dead and [they can probably still see the entry if they have downloaded them before](https://android.stackexchange.com/q/209390/44325). If they can find and/or edit the answer to preserve the usefulness, then the answers may be undeleted. For anyone else, replacing them with legal & trusted alternative markets is okay. Just be sure that the features asked are still there since devs may provide different versions on alternative markets.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@AndrewT. Besides F-Droid what alternative markets are legal & considered to be trusted?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Deleting the answers is a bad idea as one may find the APKs somewhere else (e.g., https://web.archive.org/ or from other users)


















Related discussions on Meta Stack Exchange: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/25051/resizing-an-image-in-a-postResizing an image in a post?, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/101439/please-do-something-to-encourage-people-to-scale-down-their-giant-heavyweight-ph?noredirect=1&lq=1Please do something to encourage people to scale down their giant heavyweight photos.
To be fair, there's no "proper" way of resizing an image on Stack Exchange. It's back to individual preferences.
One of the issues of using the <image> HTML tag is that the original image is still loaded, and depending on the image type (especially animation), it can be as big as 2 MB per image. This may affect the user experience for those who don't have a good internet connection and also possibly waste their limited internet quota (please consider those users too!).
Ideally, the images shown on the post directly should be size-efficient, while they can be linked back to the original size for further use if/when needed.

The vast majority of SE users have no issue downloading HD images. People with quota can prevent images from getting displayed automatically. Resizing by re-uploading a lower quality of the image, esp. if no link to the HD image, results in the image being more difficult to back up.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@FranckDernoncourt if it's sharp images for you and no images for them then, forgive me, I prefer you needing an extra click for the HD image and them having the ability to at least get an idea by seeing the ligght one ;) No offense meant. Actually, when I upload images I usually try to optimize them first to keep them small in size while still having the needed details. As usual, one cannot do it right for all people all the time…b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Izzy I prefer sharp images for 99% of users and no images for 1% of users instead of fuzzy images for 100% of users.


















I looked at the list of my removed questions and see that ~15% of my questions (~30 out of my ~210 questions) get automatically removed by Roomba (deletion script) because they have score=0 and no answer. When I look at the questions posted by anyone, a large portion of them also  have score=0 and https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2669/12202no answer (I estimate it's is >15%), which means they'll also end up being removed by Roomba.
Since getting more votes seem https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/894/12202difficult, could we relax the rules of Roomba for https://android.stackexchange.comhttps://android.stackexchange.com?

If it wasn't scoring and wasn't answered, might as well post the same question again if you still want to know the answer. Hopefully a better one, so it will attract upvotes and answers. Which will result in the question not being removed again.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Roomba helps keeping the quality of a site up.

Everyone wins.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mast "Questions nobody cared enough about are cleaned up" the OP cared enough since they took the time to post the question. It's highly likely other people have the same question. Also, that creates dead links. Lastly, there are very few votes in this site. If someone only cares about upvoted questions, they can add this in the search criteria.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5I didn't invent the system Franck, but it works.

Apparently the site does not have the userbase to sustain more questions. The solution is simple: downvote bad questions so they'll be Roomba'd even faster, upvote good questions so they won't be removed.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mast Look at https://android.stackexchange.com/questions: most questions have 0 votes. If we can't fix the users, fix the system.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5No. Your suggestion breaks the system further. If userparticipation is so low that a couple of votes are the problem adjusting the system for an ill community is counterproductive.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5@Mast it means the system isn't well designed for communities with low user participation.

Honestly, I think it's a combination of poor grammar skills, a bigger part playing out is laziness, using underated keyboards and/or speech with using microphone as dictation and the speech programs are best guessing
As an example, I wear a partial, that facsimiles' two frontward teeth and without that plate I have a soft lisp and the voice software definitely only gets....perhaps 60% correct and depending on the length of my vocal answer, I will just text, slower but far fewer corrections.i am my own proof reader that stems from the second grade when told by my teacher that when reading aloud, I sound like a robot.... I don't recall anything else from that early time In my life, but I absolutely never sounded like a robot ever again.

That experience with your teacher must have been traumatic (most teachers should *never* be allowed near students).  I'm sorry you went through that.  I still remember a kid telling me when I played the sax it sounded like a cow dying.  But that was just another kid, and not a teacher, so there was no power difference.  I was able to brush it off, but I do still somehow recall it, along with their name.  I think one lesson of your post is that it may *likely* be laziness, but it could be due to a something as important & sensitive as a medical issue.

The https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rootingrooting page says:
"Before asking how to root your device, please read the full tag wiki …".
Shouldn't "full tag wiki" be a link to the page?
(Otherwise, how would one know how to read it?)

Also, (https://android.stackexchange.com/tags/rooting/infothat page itself) says:
"create a new question, and link it to the index".
Shouldn't that be "… link it from the index"?
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Possible problems with "rooting" pageb2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51) there are no links possible in the summary IIRC. Unfortunately, a couple of years ago a site change removed the "tag wiki" link the tag referenced; you now have to visit the tag page and follow the "learn more" link there. 2) oops yes, that should be "link to it from the index" – be welcome to edit and earn some points!b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e51) Perhaps the summary could mention the "learn more" link then.
2) Done.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5Thanks for the edit! As for the excerpt: trouble is the "learn more" link is only visible if you're on the tag page, but the excerpt is also shown when hovering the tag where it's applied to a question. In the latter place, rephrasing it such would cause even more confusion, It's very unfortunate SE decided to remove the link from the popup…


















I posted a question in very simple terms earlier today: https://android.stackexchange.com/q/246618Can ANYONE help me with getting my phone that is stuck in a boot loop to be "seen" by any of my computers to get the files out? Details in the body. I took a VERY long time typing out all the details and specifics in the body, but the body only allows a very limited number of letters before it is "full." Since it didn't take my entry due to the length, I opted to start in the body then add the rest in the comments. The comments section allows for even less characters to be inputted. So I had to use A LOT of comment entries to adequately and fully describe the issue. But then my question was flagged and closed by a moderator because the details were not in the question or body, and I am not supposed to use the comments section to further describe the question, but was told to provide great detail.
How am I supposed to do that? I need quite a bit of space to describe the problem adequately, but the platform doesn't provide a lot of space. But I am not allowed to use the comments section to continue describing. Where's the give? Can anyone tell me how I can find the help I need by asking the question in a way the system asks me to but seems to not allow me to? Thank you!
b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5How do I post the details of a question without having my question closed out on this platform?b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5The answer is simple: Do not use comments, use your question. Stackexchange is not a forum.b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5"*but the body only allows a very limited number of letters before it is "full."*" sorry, could you mention the character limits you're facing? AFAIK, the usual character limit on a post is 30000 characters, so I'm quite confused by this statement considering that all of your comments took roughly 15000 chars (which is considered long enough compared to the average questions, but still half of the usual limit).b2A1I9n14a1r18y25_g7l12o15b2e5short your question to single problem. short your wot to essential points. *"Samsung Note 20 Plus Ultra got stuck in a boot loop after the last update"* is all we need to know


















I am not sure if this is off-topic for the main site. Am I allowed to ask it there?
I am shopping for a new Android and would like a web site where I can do side by side comparisons, especially if I can start by entering my preferred spec. I can't seem to find one my Googling.

Under the guise of asking whether a question is allowed on the main site, he has formulated that question HERE instead. Is that the proper procedure now?

I deleted the answer precisely because of https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2695/android-phone-specs-comparison-site#comment7013_2695the comment on the question:

[...] Under the guise of asking whether a question is allowed on the main site, he has formulated that question HERE instead. [...] Are we creating slide-questions-in-through-META precedent?

The linked question was asking whether such a question is on-topic or not. There's actually no problem with the meta question since providing a sample question can clarify what the discussion is about.
As per https://android.stackexchange.com/help/whats-metaWhat's Meta?,

Meta Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange is the part of the site where users discuss the workings and policies of Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange rather than discussing Android itself. It is separated from the main Q&A to reduce noise there while providing a legitimate space for people to ask how and why this site works the way it does.

However, instead of providing arguments for the premise of the discussion, the answer in the question directly answered the sample question. This is giving a bad precedent where users may get the wrong idea that there is a loophole to use meta sites to ask any Android questions that are not allowed on the main site.

I noticed https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2695/android-phone-specs-comparison-site#comment7014_2695your comment reply on there:

some SEs do that.

While I also noticed that some SE sites do that (e.g. learning/resource recommendation on child meta), note that this community hasn't had any discussion and decision on whether such questions are allowed or not on the meta.
The only exceptional case that I know of is https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/371/where-can-i-ask-questions-that-arent-android-enthusiast-questionsWhere can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?, but that is more for moderation purposes (linked from the closed post notice banner).

How should we treat ChatGPT (and other AI-generated) posts?

Just like any other answer, i.e. upvote if good, downvote if bad, flag if useless. See my answer https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/384405/178179here for my rationale.

Good point, I was just referring to the content. Regarding the attribution, it's quite rare that large language models regurgitate content verbatim https://ai.stackexchange.com/q/38431/4 My guess is that large language models are less prone to plagiarism than the average SE user. Note that SE could add automated plagiarism detection, but AFAIK never cared enough to do so. I believe the SE staff in question just mentioned that one should simply attribute the large language model.
